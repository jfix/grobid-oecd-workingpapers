			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT <lb/>MAIN POINTS <lb/>Today, spectrum, more than ever, is identified by policy makers as a key asset to support growth in <lb/>the Digital Economy. This report provides information and analysis on new approaches to radiofrequency <lb/>spectrum management in OECD countries. The remarkable growth in the use of smartphones and other <lb/>wireless devices, experienced in recent years, has increased demands on the radio spectrum throughout the <lb/>OECD area. This is why authorities are seeking to maximise the spectrum resources made available for <lb/>wireless communication services and to increase the efficiencies made in their use. <lb/>The best way to ascertain the economic value of spectrum for wireless communication providers is to <lb/>examine new approaches to spectrum management, including the adoption of market mechanisms, such as <lb/>through the conduct of open and transparent auction procedures. Nonetheless, policy makers need to take <lb/>into account a range of considerations related to overall economic, social benefits, as well as the <lb/>preservation of critical government services derived from the use of spectrum, and these may not easily be <lb/>determined by market prices. Virtually all sectors of the economy, from education to health care or SME <lb/>productivity, could benefit from more widely available and efficient wireless broadband services. These <lb/>areas increasingly use unlicensed spectrum through a variety of existing applications, such as Wireless <lb/>Local Area Networks (WLAN, broadly called and thereinafter referred to as &quot; Wi-Fi networks &quot; ), short <lb/>range devices, and so forth. <lb/>License-exempt (or unlicensed) spectrum is itself a market allocation mechanism, with no entry price <lb/>attached but instead conditions of shared use set by administrations. This approach has proven its merits <lb/>for a number of applications, such as Wi-Fi and these benefits may not have been achieved if traditional <lb/>approaches and practices to the allocation and authorisation of such spectrum had been followed. 1 The <lb/>challenge, therefore, is to make greater use of the efficiencies that market mechanisms can bring across <lb/>both licensed and unlicensed spectrum including, where technically feasible, greater shared use. The <lb/>enormous success of Wi-Fi networks underscores that licensed-exempt spectrum can be used extensively, <lb/>in combination with shared and exclusive uses. <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation at the global level is a desirable long-term goal that has the potential to <lb/>enhance economies of scale for network deployment and device manufacturing. This general objective <lb/>needs to be set against other spectrum management goals such as band harmonisation at the regional level, <lb/>the promotion of spectrum trading and flexibility for all players to adopt innovative technological solutions <lb/>and the protection of critical government services. It also needs to take into account other constraints such <lb/>as international frequency co-ordination, interference mitigation and the current uses made of spectrum. <lb/>The emergence of new technologies such as cognitive radio and geolocation databases enables the <lb/>implementation of new spectrum licensing frameworks, based on the licensed or unlicensed shared use of <lb/>spectrum. The new approaches proposed for spectrum sharing aim at maximising spectrum efficiency by <lb/>allowing a third-party to use underutilised spectrum resources held by government and commercial users <lb/>or by other stakeholders that do not fully exploit their spectrum capacity. Spectrum sharing through <lb/>enhanced mechanisms may become the norm, not the exception, in the near future. <lb/>Spectrum inventories offer opportunities for identifying spectrum supply, assessing its demand and <lb/>consulting with all stakeholders on the different proposals. This could assist, together with technical <lb/>studies, in identifying candidate bands for sharing and assessing the feasibility of deployment scenarios for <lb/>new entrants. In that respect, spectrum inventories could be used by policy makers, following a cost-<lb/>benefit analysis, in the process towards publishing rules for spectrum use. In particular, they can assist in <lb/></body>

			<body>highlighting underutilisation of spectrum and thus, in enabling shared use. Policy makers also need to <lb/>tackle the existing challenges such as effective authorisation procedures that limit third party access to <lb/>those instances where spectrum is underutilised, improved mitigation techniques for harmful interference <lb/>and limited disruption of existing services. <lb/>Incentive auctions, for example, are an innovative approach to transfer spectrum resources from less <lb/>to more valuable uses through market mechanisms. Several factors may be critical to their success in the <lb/>long term, such as having a sufficient amount of broadcasters willing to release spectrum or the flexibility <lb/>to undertake the repacking process to achieve sufficiently harmonised band plans. Other countries may also <lb/>face several constraints to conduct an incentive auction, such as the need for a regionally co-ordinated <lb/>approach and incumbent spectrum uses. Recent technology developments may also contribute to the same <lb/>goal by achieving greater spectrum efficiency for broadcasting services. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>INTRODUCTION: SPECTRUM AND THE INTERNET ECONOMY <lb/>The unprecedented increase in the take up of smartphones and other wireless devices is leading many <lb/>to reassess the amount of radio frequency spectrum that will be required to support future growth in the <lb/>Internet economy. This is critical, as it will underpin the ability of OECD countries to ensure competitive <lb/>communication markets, which will in turn drive the innovation necessary to meet broader economic and <lb/>social development. The challenge before policy makers is how to make more spectrum available for <lb/>space-based and terrestrial wireless communication services to meet current and future demand and, at the <lb/>same time, achieve a more efficient use of this resource. <lb/>Current developments in mobile technologies have expanded the applications of wireless broadband <lb/>services which could, in some cases, serve as a substitute for fixed broadband (being complementary in <lb/>most scenarios). Relevant examples are in rural or sparsely populated areas but also in providing <lb/>competition to traditional telecommunication services as well as in the provision of new services, including <lb/>in areas such as machine-to-machine communications. <lb/>All national broadband plans in OECD countries have as a key feature the use of wireless <lb/>technologies to complement fixed networks and as such put an emphasis on the availability of spectrum <lb/>resources (OECD, 2011). The European Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP), for example, includes the <lb/>action of ensuring that at least 1 200 MHz, of the radio spectrum are identified (including spectrum for <lb/>which this has already been done) to address the increasing demand for wireless data traffic and that the <lb/>need for additional harmonised spectrum bands is assessed. In 2007, an ITU-R report (ITU, 2012) <lb/>estimated that between 1 280 MHz and 1 720 MHz of spectrum would be required to meet the demands of <lb/>mobile broadband applications and services by 2020. The spectrum requirements to meet the demand need <lb/>to be updated using the revised methodology provided by Recommendation ITU-R M.1768-1(ITU, 2013). <lb/>Countries&apos; needs for additional spectrum vary. The report also indicates that some countries require more <lb/>than the 1 720 MHz of spectrum, that other countries require less than the 1 280 MHz, while other <lb/>countries do not need any additional spectrum for these services. <lb/>This report first puts into perspective the need for improved spectrum policies and why this is critical <lb/>for the Internet economy. It does so by compiling recent studies that have been undertaken in the area of <lb/>spectrum valuation. As the main rationale behind the reassessment of spectrum management is to facilitate <lb/>spectrum reallocation, from less to more valuable use, the report provides an overview of some methods <lb/>used to estimate the economic value of spectrum and, more broadly, its implications on the overall <lb/>economy. The new approaches to spectrum management addressed in this report largely fall under two <lb/>broad categories of initiatives: those targeted at making more spectrum resources available for wireless <lb/>communication services, primarily mobile broadband; and those aimed at maximising spectrum efficiency. <lb/>Broadly, three types of efficiency could be considered: dynamic (i.e. enables the use of the most innovative <lb/>services), allocative (assigns spectrum to the undertakings that value it most) and productive (i.e. reduces <lb/>production costs of radio-communication services). In practice, the decision making process would need to <lb/>take into account all three types of efficiency and, in some cases, reach trade-offs between them. <lb/>Further harmonisation of spectrum has been at the heart of international co-operation, and <lb/>negotiations on this issue are on-going in international fora, including the relevant regional organisations. <lb/>Furthermore, spectrum harmonisation makes economies of scale possible, which brings down the cost of <lb/>deploying networks and manufacturing wireless devices, as well as facilitating roaming services and the <lb/>mitigation of harmful cross-border interference. This plays a pivotal role in enabling the use of additional <lb/>spectrum resources for communication services and in promoting spectrum efficiency in current or future <lb/>spectrum bands used for those services. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT <lb/>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/></note>

			<body>9 <lb/>The increased sharing of spectrum could greatly enhance spectrum efficiency for certain services. <lb/>Spectrum can be shared by different users, at different times, codes or geographical locations. This would, <lb/>however, necessitate innovative licensing models that could depart from the two main licensing schemes <lb/>that have been extremely successful to date: license-exempt and individual exclusive licenses. The new <lb/>approaches include light-licensing models or individual licensing under certain sharing conditions that can <lb/>allow spectrum utilisation while the incumbent user -an entity having preferential rights of use -is not <lb/>utilising the spectrum. Other spectrum sharing models are already in place, and the permanent innovation <lb/>in spectrum sharing scenarios provides additional opportunities for greater spectrum sharing which needs <lb/>to overcome the reluctance from incumbents to share spectrum resources currently used for critical <lb/>applications, such as national defence and security, transportation systems, safety-of-life and safety-of-<lb/>flight. <lb/>Maximising spectrum resources for wireless communications and promoting its efficient use, needs to <lb/>rely on a set of policy principles, such as transparency, flexibility, competition, and so forth. Spectrum <lb/>auctions have been effectively deployed for two decades and have assisted in the allocation of spectrum <lb/>through making greater use of the market. In that respect, incentive auctions constitute an innovative <lb/>approach that has been proposed by the United States Federal Communications Commission as a voluntary, <lb/>market-based tool to transfer spectrum resources from broadcasters to communication providers. It can <lb/>play a crucial role in driving spectrum resources from less to more valuable uses, according to the <lb/>valuation criteria of different administrations. When assessing the value of allocating spectrum bands to <lb/>different services, policy makers need to take into account broader societal values, such as media plurality <lb/>and cultural diversity. They should also assess the impact of spectrum management on the industry&apos;s <lb/>competition trends. <lb/>THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF SPECTRUM <lb/>A question that arises when policy makers consider the radio spectrum is its valuation in terms of the <lb/>contributions its exploitation makes to economic and social development. Will, for example, the use of a <lb/>part of the spectrum for one communication service over another provide greater value to an economy and <lb/>better meet public policy objectives? One approach to determining the value of spectrum is to sell the right <lb/>to make use of part of the radio spectrum, such as via an auction, or by introducing a mechanism to enable <lb/>an existing rights holder to trade that resource. This enables the market to play a role in determining the <lb/>fiscal value of spectrum and assist in assessing the economic valuation of any transition from one use to <lb/>another. <lb/>A market assessment of the valuation of a part of the radio spectrum will take into account many <lb/>factors including the existence of any distortions contained in processes used for assignment. From the <lb/>perspective of a communication service provider, the economic value of spectrum is associated with the <lb/>revenues and financial returns achieved through the use of these resources. This can, in turn, be a function <lb/>of factors such as regulatory conditions, competition, spectrum rights, technological development, <lb/>propagation characteristics, assessed demand for services and so forth, as highlighted in the joint <lb/>BEREC/RSPG report (BEREC/RSPG, 2012). The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) has also <lb/>launched a public consultation on licensed shared access (RSPG, 2012). A non-exhaustive list of studies <lb/>that estimate spectrum value is provided in the Annex to this report. <lb/>Apart from market valuations, authorities take a further broad range of objectives into consideration <lb/>when establishing spectrum policy. Some of these uses of the radio spectrum are potentially measurable in <lb/>terms of valuation including by the use of market mechanisms. While it has been noted, such as in the joint <lb/>BEREC/RSPG report, that market prices are only one factor to be taken into account in an overall <lb/>macroeconomic assessment, market mechanisms can provide a valuable and transparent tool to be <lb/>considered in developing spectrum policy. Virtually all sectors of the economy, from education to health <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>care or SME productivity, could benefit from more widely available and efficient wireless broadband <lb/>services. Making sufficient spectrum available to support these requirements, therefore, is a priority for all <lb/>policy makers while taking into account factors such as the continuity of services critical for economies <lb/>and societies, such as use by defence and emergency services, as well as existing commitments. This <lb/>section examines and provides an overview on measuring practices of spectrum values that can be <lb/>quantified while reflecting broader economic and social development. 2 <lb/>The economic valuation of the radio spectrum is challenging due to its inherent complexity, <lb/>dependency on market conditions, data scarcity and forecast techniques, even though efforts have been <lb/>made to value parts of the spectrum related to specific uses. In the United Kingdom, for example, the <lb/>Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport <lb/>(DCMS) published a report, in 2012, which estimated the economic value of spectrum allocated to public <lb/>communication services (e.g. mobile services, television broadcasting and so forth). The report concluded <lb/>that public mobile communications generated a value of USD 48.7 billion in 2011, while the largest <lb/>economic value derived from other services was USD 12.4 billion, which was produced by television <lb/>broadcasting (BIS and DCMS, 2012). <lb/>Some studies attempt to assign broader considerations in any valuation of the use of a part of the radio <lb/>spectrum. An exercise conducted by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA), for <lb/>example, provided an indication of the importance of spectrum to the economy and society, without <lb/>valuing the spectrum as such. It not only predicted a total economic value (USD 14.5 billion for 2011-12), <lb/>through the use of spectrum, but also indicated what would be the benefits in terms of employment, <lb/>i.e. how many jobs would be added to the industry by the position it advocated (AMTA and Deloitte, 2013). <lb/>This study made the case for additional spectrum to be made available for mobile broadband, by showing <lb/>the social impact of mobile technologies and their importance to business. <lb/>There are many studies that take a position on certain approaches to spectrum management and then <lb/>endeavour to associate a value to pursuing that course of action. One undertaken on behalf of Microsoft <lb/>looked at the economic value of license-exempt spectrum. It estimated that the unlicensed Wi-Fi use <lb/>provided a consumer surplus of between USD 52 billion to USD 99 billion per annum globally, by <lb/>enhancing the value of fixed broadband connections (Thanki, 2012). This study further estimated a further <lb/>value of between USD 560 billion to USD 870 billion per annum in 2020 for machine-to-machine <lb/>communications (M2M) using Wi-Fi. This approach endeavoured to assess the value of the spectrum <lb/>allocated to a specific industry rather than the spectrum size actually allocated in the field. <lb/>Other studies focus on the incremental economic value from making a specific spectrum bandwidth <lb/>available for use by certain industries. In the case of mobile communication this could, for example, be the <lb/>economic value of the digital dividend (e.g. the 700 MHz band in some regions). In 2010, the GSM <lb/>Association reported an estimated economic value of USD 28.2 billion and USD 4.5 billion in the Asia-<lb/>Pacific region for the 698-806 MHz band under two scenarios (GSMA and Boston Consulting Group, <lb/>2010). These were the allocations for mobile broadband service and to broadcasting services, including the <lb/>estimated implications on job creation and government tax revenues. The GSMA has conducted similar <lb/>exercises for the Asia-Pacific region with assumption of harmonisation (GSMA and Boston Consulting <lb/>Group, 2012) and also for Latin America, reporting a much higher value generated from mobile services <lb/>than from broadcasting in those regions (GSMA/AHCIET, 2011). In addition, a GSMA report assessed the <lb/>incremental benefits from sharing spectrum in the 2.3 GHz and the 3.5 GHz band in the European Union <lb/>and the United States, considering licensed shared access for mobile network operators (GSMA, Deloitte <lb/>and Real Wireless, 2014). <lb/></body>

			<body>If an analysis is based on the economic welfare gains, for use of spectrum by different sectors, in <lb/>terms of their percentage contribution to GDP, for a given country or region, the estimations can, of course, <lb/>vary. These can, for example, range from 0.03% (AMTA, 2009) to 2.04% (GSMA/Plum Consulting, 2013) <lb/>per annum if used for mobile services, and from 0.05% (GSMA/AHCIET, 2011) to 0.93% (MPA and <lb/>JIMCA, 2012) if used for broadcasting purposes. The differences between those results can be partly <lb/>attributed to the variety of market situations in different countries or regions, and also to differences in <lb/>methodology or in the concept of economic value itself. From this perspective, it can be noted that <lb/>different concepts of economic value may be used by different studies or even within the same report. In <lb/>that respect, there seem to be at least three broad categories of approaches taken to measure the value: <lb/>economic welfare, economic contribution, and productivity increase, as illustrated below. <lb/>Economic welfare <lb/>The economic welfare approach is based on classical microeconomic theory that seeks to estimate the <lb/>sum of economic surplus gained by consumers, producers and governments. This is often called &quot; social <lb/>welfare &quot; despite only including surpluses accrued in markets and measured in monetary terms. This report <lb/>refers to this as &quot; economic welfare &quot; to underline that it does not fully address social value. Economic <lb/>welfare is usually composed of consumer and producer surplus. The former is a measure of the difference <lb/>between each user&apos;s willingness to pay for a specific service and its actual price. Accordingly, producer <lb/>surplus accounts for the gap between the price paid and the lowest price at which the seller would be <lb/>willing to sell (typically the marginal production cost). The sum of producer and consumer surpluses <lb/>provides the overall benefit from a service provided in the market, such as for mobile communication <lb/>service and broadcasting. <lb/>From the perspective of telecommunication policy, this approach is particularly meaningful in that it <lb/>includes both the benefits from lower prices and of additional subscribers of a given service that requires <lb/>spectrum, while at the same time reflecting the providers&apos; benefit related to their profits. As economic <lb/>welfare is measured and estimated only for a specific single market, additional work will be required if <lb/>policy makers wish to take into account external benefits. These benefits could, for example, be those in <lb/>related markets (e.g. accrued in the mobile applications market as a result of a larger mobile <lb/>communication market) or for the whole economy (e.g. increased growth or productivity rates as a result of <lb/>mobile service provision). This is why welfare gains restricted to a specific market could widely differ <lb/>from the overall welfare gain. <lb/>In practical terms, assessing consumer surplus requires an estimation of consumers&apos; willingness to <lb/>pay, or consumer demand. Given that consumer surplus is the difference between this number and the <lb/>actual price paid, it would be unrealistic to ask consumers about their willingness to pay directly. Hence, <lb/>some techniques have been developed to enable estimates to be made. The BIS/DCMS study in United <lb/>Kingdom tackled this challenge by assuming a linear consumer demand curve and estimating a &quot; choke <lb/>price &quot; , at which no consumer would subscribe, that being a demand equal to zero. Although this type of <lb/>estimation still requires survey-based research on consumers to find out the choke price, in addition to <lb/>information on actual prices paid and quantities provided (e.g. subscription numbers) it may represent a <lb/>viable method to measure consumer surplus. <lb/>Some approaches do not aim at measuring the economic value of spectrum but at estimating consumer <lb/>surplus in telecommunications markets. A further approach is one that estimates the lower bound for a <lb/>consumer&apos;s willingness to pay by assuming that anyone who adopts a service (e.g. broadband), at a given <lb/>point in time, would be willing to pay the same subscription price in subsequent years. If communication <lb/>prices decrease over time, the sum of these price differences would provide an estimation of consumer <lb/>surplus. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>Producer surplus can be estimated from data on revenues and costs incurred by communication <lb/>providers. Costs are, however, challenging to estimate for several reasons. First, future costs in response to <lb/>future increases of demand are challenging to predict, given the existence of fixed costs spread across <lb/>several functions or areas of firms, or even across different services. The United Kingdom study used <lb/>Analysis Mason&apos;s internal databases in addition to the operators&apos; annual reports to estimate their costs. <lb/>Other studies do not measure producer surplus and, instead, adopt a different approach, such as assessing <lb/>consumer surplus only. Notwithstanding this, the report carried out for the United Kingdom, noted that <lb/>over 80% of economic welfare came from consumer surplus both for mobile communications and <lb/>broadcasting. If authorities are unable to estimate the producer surplus, other indicators may be used as a <lb/>reference, such as revenues or spectrum market prices. <lb/>Economic contribution <lb/>A further approach to spectrum valuation aims to measure the total value added to the economy in the <lb/>course of industrial production processes or an industry&apos;s value chain. The strength of this approach is that <lb/>it can provide very clear and concrete figures showing how much value, as a result of service provision, <lb/>can be translated to a percentage of GDP and partly delivered to employees. <lb/>One of the approaches to measure GDP is the aggregated value added of the different industries of an <lb/>economy. This can also take into account the indirect contribution to an economy realised by other <lb/>industries. If a mobile operator purchases equipment, for example to expand its coverage as a result of a <lb/>spectrum allocation, the demand for that equipment increases and is conducive to an additional value <lb/>added in equipment sales. This is in addition to the value added from mobile service provision. Similar <lb/>contributions from third party services provided by a mobile network can be also counted to capture a <lb/>broader scope of the economic impact of the mobile ecosystem. On the other hand, this approach does not <lb/>cover benefits for consumers except for a very indirect effect of income increase brought about by the <lb/>service provision (if such an effect is estimated), so there is a risk that low subscription numbers and high <lb/>prices may be identified as a positive outcome. A further and relevant consideration is the substantial <lb/>effects on the whole economy caused by productivity increases over time. <lb/>To sum up, the economic contribution approach is attractive if policy makers wish to stimulate the <lb/>economy and increase GDP by activating unused capacity, of an economy, through spectrum allocation. <lb/>Finally, though unlikely in the OECD area, it has been suggested that the total value added measured by <lb/>this approach may not be related to living standards when there is little capacity (such as unused labour or <lb/>capital) available in an economy. <lb/>From a practical point of view, this approach provides a fairly simple estimation method as it utilises <lb/>input-output tables that are usually available for most countries. These record the inputs and outputs of <lb/>specific sectors of the economy. Nonetheless, when estimating indirect effects on other industries in <lb/>addition to direct effects, it is necessary to identify which industries provided intermediate inputs for the <lb/>use of the spectrum that enables the communication service. This information gathering process may need <lb/>co-operation from mobile service providers as it may require additional information or assumptions. <lb/>Challenges are also expected if the approach intends to include value added from third party services. <lb/>Productivity increase <lb/>A further approach would consist of measuring growth as a result of the adoption of services using <lb/>spectrum resources, in that the use of these services leads to a larger economic output (GDP), capital and <lb/>labour being equal. For example, an employee may deliver a higher output by using his time more <lb/>effectively by using mobile communications. A company may replace some computers with smartphones <lb/>and thus reduce the capital stock devoted to purchasing computers. The difference from the contribution <lb/></body>

			<body>approach noted above is that the productivity approach attempts to estimate external effects on GDP <lb/>growth that would be realised in the long-term. Although productivity does not affect consumers directly, <lb/>lower service prices enabled by the use of spectrum may increase adoption of services and increase a <lb/>firm&apos;s productivity. This would in turn boost income per capita, which could eventually benefit consumers <lb/>in a competitive market. <lb/>This approach may, however, be the most challenging to assess among the three proposed in this <lb/>section. In Australia, a study estimated the value derived from productivity increases by using a private <lb/>data source and an internal economic model with several assumptions and scenarios (AMTA and Deloitte, <lb/>2013). Studies undertaken by the GSMA for the Asia-Pacific region predicted productivity improvements <lb/>by estimating future Internet adoption rates and their impact on agriculture, services and manufacturing <lb/>sectors. These methodologies may entail some complexities and can be difficult to replicate with only <lb/>publicly available information. <lb/>Over recent years, there has been extensive research on the effects of ICTs on productivity. By way of <lb/>example, an OECD review of existing literature concluded that the productivity effect is not only <lb/>significant but also increasing over time (Kretschmer, 2012). One such study, undertaken by Gruber and <lb/>Koutroumpis in 2010, estimated that mobile communications contributed 0.39% per annum to GDP growth <lb/>in the OECD area (Gruber and Koutroumpis, 2010). Nevertheless, a study undertaken in the United States <lb/>lists a number of references that provide estimates on the macroeconomic performance caused by ICT <lb/>adoption, by also pointing out that it may be premature to ascertain the productivity effects of wireless <lb/>broadband services (Sosa and van Audenrode, 2011). <lb/>ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF SPECTRUM HARMONISATION <lb/>The harmonisation of spectrum bands has significant economic implications for policy makers to <lb/>consider. While the choices made by individual countries go beyond the scope of this report, there are <lb/>economic implications resulting from those choices. <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation is a desirable goal for all types of radio communication services that <lb/>increases economies of scale for equipment and simplifies assignment procedures. Nevertheless, spectrum <lb/>harmonisation may be at odds with other policy objectives, such as favouring flexibility by, for example, <lb/>promoting spectrum trading, or taking due account of specific domestic circumstances (e.g. historical band <lb/>allocations and incumbent uses) in relation to spectrum planning and management. Innovation in wireless <lb/>technologies may also be, to some extent, limited by a lack of flexibility in &quot; band plans &quot; and technical <lb/>conditions. On the other hand, these conditions may be strongly desirable to achieve economies of scale <lb/>and certainty for investment for all players. For example, the opportunities for flexibility originally <lb/>proposed by the European Commission (WAPECS approach) in the 2.6 GHz band in Europe have not been <lb/>implemented, as market players preferred to adopt the stable CEPT harmonised band plan which they <lb/>thought would provide a higher certainty for their investment. <lb/>Even though new wireless technologies, such as LTE, allow a more flexible use of the different <lb/>spectrum bands, compared to 2G (GSM) or 3G (UMTS and CDMA2000) technologies, which avoid <lb/>spectrum fragmentation, the importance of harmonisation is increasingly significant. According to the <lb/>GSMA&apos;s Wireless Intelligence, by 2015 there will be 200 live LTE networks, deployed over 38 different <lb/>spectrum frequency combinations. 3 This will raise device interoperability issues and may result in <lb/>spectrum fragmentation. It could reduce the benefits of economies of scale and increase equipment costs, <lb/>which may result in end-users in certain areas being excluded from the most recent developments in <lb/>wireless technologies. Moreover, consumers and businesses benefit from cross-country roaming when <lb/>travelling or doing business abroad. As such, further harmonisation is desirable with notable economic <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>benefits. For a business this could be, for example, in better improving the management of a fleet. Globally, <lb/>policy makers could identify one or more candidate bands for global interoperability. <lb/>A very recent example of these concerns, triggered by the strategy of some device manufacturers, is <lb/>the inability of users in many European and Asian countries to use LTE services on some iPhone devices. <lb/>This is because, for some devices, the iPhone&apos;s LTE connectivity does not cover the 800 MHz and 2.6 <lb/>GHz bands, used for LTE in many European countries. Moreover, Apple has manufactured three different <lb/>iPhone models, supporting different bands, which could make carrier switching and international roaming <lb/>more challenging. Other leading device manufacturers made a different choice and supported the European <lb/>800 MHz and 2.6 GHz harmonised bands for LTE, which have the advantage of being relatively wide. <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation: A desirable goal with many hurdles <lb/>No one denies, of course, the benefits of spectrum harmonisation. Few would argue against existing <lb/>incentives to achieve economies of scale and simplify device manufacturing. Nonetheless, there are many <lb/>different obstacles to changing current spectrum uses. These can be, for example, the costs in migration of <lb/>incumbent systems that may be challenging to move in related policy areas such as national defence and <lb/>security, transportation systems or navigation tools. <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation is fully related to the spectrum management approach chosen. For example, <lb/>allowing spectrum trading (e.g. rights of use) and more autonomous management of spectrum by assignees <lb/>could potentially be counterproductive for spectrum harmonisation in the medium or long term, as band <lb/>segmentation plans for licensed spectrum would not be harmonised. Nevertheless, some argue that <lb/>allowing market forces to work more efficiently could potentially help achieve band harmonisation more <lb/>rapidly, while others say that harmonisation, when technical parameters are kept to a minimum, should not <lb/>prevent flexibility. Spectrum trading, increased shared use of spectrum and technology neutrality may not <lb/>necessarily lead to spectrum harmonisation and economies of scale for equipment, but quite the contrary. <lb/>Historical band assignments may also be a challenge towards greater harmonisation. <lb/>Harmonising spectrum at a regional or global level usually includes the following tasks: <lb/>i) <lb/>reaching agreements on the lower and upper edge of band covered; <lb/>ii) <lb/>guard band definition or, generally speaking, the band&apos;s segmentation; <lb/>iii) the technology and duplexing techniques that may be used in each of the segments/blocks <lb/>of the bands (e.g. FDD, TDD); <lb/>iv) arrangements to provide interference protection from adjacent blocks or bands; <lb/>v) <lb/>re-allocation and re-planning of existing users and services; <lb/>vi) channelling; <lb/>vii) other technical conditions judged necessary to allow service operation in a given band, <lb/>including sharing conditions, and so forth. <lb/>These measures aimed at harmonisation are important in that they provide certainty for equipment <lb/>makers and operators to foresee and assess forthcoming investment. They also facilitate the role of <lb/>spectrum administrations in co-ordinating frequencies with neighbouring countries and undertake spectrum <lb/>planning on a long-term basis. Nevertheless, harmonisation measures can involve a high degree of <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>complexity, as the introduction of harmonised conditions and procedures need to be co-ordinated among <lb/>the different countries, usually under a common time schedule. <lb/>Some believe harmonisation measures could preclude further technological innovations in a band or, <lb/>more broadly, flexible use of spectrum. Flexibility – enabled by limited harmonisation – may have some <lb/>advantages as well. For instance, in markets where there is more demand for wireless broadband services, <lb/>carriers may be able to deploy their own solutions and technologies and maximise capacity or delivery <lb/>times in these areas. At the same time, there could be more freedom for new technologies to be tested <lb/>and/or adopted than would be the case when observing harmonised technical conditions and band plans. <lb/>There seems to be, however, a relatively general consensus that the benefits of harmonisation offset those <lb/>of flexibility. <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation is not only important for the provision of commercial communication services, <lb/>including radio and television broadcasting. It also plays a key role in the provision of public services, such as <lb/>emergency services (designated as PPDR -Public Protection and Disaster Relief -by the ITU or in Europe or <lb/>Public Safety in the United States). These are an example of broader societal benefits resulting from <lb/>harmonised spectrum (WIK-Consult, 2010). For example, recent requests for harmonisation of emergency <lb/>services in the United States or the European Union area confirm this assessment. Some degree of <lb/>harmonised spectrum would enable enhanced interaction between emergency agencies in neighbouring <lb/>countries, using interoperable bands and procedures that enable roaming, for tasks such as natural disaster <lb/>responses. As for other spectrum uses, it would also enhance economies of scale for equipment used in the <lb/>provision of emergency services. Common radiofrequency spectrum will advance international aid during <lb/>disasters and major events. International and regional harmonisation will improve interoperability among first <lb/>responders and drive suitable devices and standards dedicated to broadband PPDR. <lb/>The role of the industry <lb/>Standardisation plays a key role in addressing technology constraints on band harmonisation. <lb/>International standards bodies such as the ETSI, IEEE, ISO, ITU-T or 3GPP respond to requests from <lb/>industry and develop standards for radiocommunications. The ability of these bodies to respond quickly to <lb/>these requests clearly determines the way forward regarding the use of common band plans and technical <lb/>requirements for emerging technologies or in discussions for harmonising certain spectrum bands. <lb/>In addition to standardisation, mobile operators and equipment manufacturers may clearly benefit <lb/>from increased band harmonisation. According to the GSMA, the additional manufacturing costs due to <lb/>spectrum fragmentation amount to USD 15 per device for a production of 8 million units, USD 1.5 for 80 <lb/>million and USD 0.15 for 800 million devices, subject to certain assumptions (GSMA, 2007). There are, <lb/>however, several precisions to be made in this respect. In some cases, industry-driven harmonisation may <lb/>be based on economies of scale that may not be spectrum efficient, or at least in some countries or regions. <lb/>For example, if a given band segmentation plan is flexible enough for equipment makers to achieve <lb/>economies of scale it may rather involve some efficiency losses in some regions, which may be justified by <lb/>lower equipment costs. <lb/>A different, related issue is the timing of deployments in a given band, which may impose serious <lb/>restrictions on equipment manufacturers and operators when accommodating future band segmentations or <lb/>technical requirements. If early deployments in a given band have involved important investments in <lb/>designing, developing and testing equipment, there may be a strong opposition if further technical <lb/>proposals are not fully compatible with the initial deployment. Interoperability issues may also have <lb/>important implications in addition to economies of scale, as policy makers may want to improve consumer <lb/>switching or guarantee that smaller providers have a fair choice of equipment possibilities. An example for <lb/>this is the 700 MHz interoperability issues in the United States, described below. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>Finally, the industry clearly has a prominent role in putting forward proposals for harmonising bands <lb/>on a regional or global level. Industry players may first seek to harmonise neighbouring bands of those <lb/>already used for mobile communications, as this may impose lighter constraints on developing new <lb/>equipment. These bands also facilitate new deployments for mobile communications and enable easier <lb/>sharing or upgrading of existing sites. Equipment manufacturers also face limitations in the number of <lb/>lower frequency bands (under 1 GHz) that a single device can support. <lb/>An example: The 700 MHz band <lb/>The 700 MHz band may be the most telling example of harmonisation efforts leading to a series of <lb/>band segmentation standards. This is because it is perceived to address many of the future requirements for <lb/>wireless broadband spectrum. The 700 MHz band was at the heart of the discussions at the International <lb/>Telecommunications Union&apos;s (ITU) World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-12) and will be <lb/>prominent at the upcoming WRC-15. Known as the &quot; digital dividend &quot; band in many countries (e.g. <lb/>Australia, Mexico and the United States), and the second &quot; digital dividend &quot; in Europe, it has been targeted <lb/>for future mobile communications use. Its favourable propagation characteristics make it ideal for <lb/>extending coverage in rural areas and increasing indoor reception while reducing investment in mobile <lb/>network deployments, as fewer base stations are needed to cover a given area. <lb/>Different regions and/or countries of the world have proposed different band plans for the digital <lb/>dividend in the 700 MHz and/or 800 MHz bands (Figure 1). While countries from the European <lb/>Conference for Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have allocated the 790-862 MHz <lb/>band for mobile communication (digital dividend), the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) designed a <lb/>different band plan for the 700 MHz band (698-806 MHz). The Inter-American Telecommunications <lb/>Commission (CITEL) adopted a recommendation for CITEL administrations that wish to deploy <lb/>broadband networks to meet PPDR needs in the 700 MHz band, and consider the bands 703-748/758-803 <lb/>MHz and 758-768/788-798 MHz. The WRC-12 allocated the 700 MHz band for mobile use, on a co-<lb/>primary basis, effective after the WRC-2015 in Region 1, so that it could either be allocated to <lb/>broadcasting or mobile communication services (in Region 1 the 790-862 MHz band had been identified <lb/>for IMT-2000 at the WRC-07). At the next WRC (WRC-2015), the ITU will have to decide on the lower <lb/>edge of this allocation, currently at 694 MHz for Region 1. The ITU has also proposed different <lb/>segmentation plans for the 700 MHz band in its Recommendation ITU-R M.1036, namely proposing five <lb/>alternatives (A1 to A5). In view of these alternatives, different regions have chosen different segmentation <lb/>plans (e.g. CEPT for the 800 MHz band, APT and CITEL for the 700 MHz band). <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>At the March 2013 meeting of the CEPT&apos;s Electronic Communications Committee, a number of <lb/>countries voiced calls to consider studies on a long-term vision for the UHF broadcasting band. 4 This has <lb/>been prompted by the WRC-15 agenda Item 1.1 (additional spectrum allocations to the mobile service to <lb/>facilitate the development of terrestrial mobile broadband), which has discussed proposals for the ITU-R to <lb/>consider a further mobile allocation in the 470-694 MHz spectrum. Current work at the CEPT includes <lb/>studies to support the development of a long-term vision of the UHF band in Europe. This would take into <lb/>account broadcasting spectrum needs, wireless broadband and other applications such as PMSE, and issues <lb/>surrounding the efficiency of the European approach to the UHF band. 5 <lb/>Mexico has been one the countries that has adopted the APT band plan for 700 MHz after evaluating <lb/>the different possibilities, such as being more aligned with that of the United States and Canada or the <lb/>possibility of achieving larger economies of scale (COFETEL, 2012). Bearing in mind the discussions that <lb/>are being held in the United States and Canada regarding the band&apos;s interoperability and, especially, the <lb/>larger uplink and downlink bands of the segmentation plan proposed by the APT, Mexico has decided to <lb/>go forward with the APT band plan. The significant development of LTE technologies in Asian markets, <lb/>such as China, where most of the world&apos;s population lives, is likely to enhance the economies of scale of <lb/>device makers and lower the end price of devices for those countries adopting this plan. <lb/>The Mexican regulator, Cofetel, has undertaken technical studies to estimate the time required to <lb/>deploy a wireless network using the APT and the United States band plans, drawing the conclusion that the <lb/>time required for deployment would be at least 1.5 times longer if using the United States band plan, initial <lb/>investment would be 5.6 times higher and mobile carriers would need to deploy 4.5 times more radio <lb/>stations. Nevertheless, given that the United States and Mexico share a land border, required co-ordination <lb/>needs to take place to address potential harmful interference between emissions in border areas of both <lb/>countries. Based on the benefits of the APT band plan, together with the co-ordination costs for the United <lb/>States/Mexico border, Mexico has decided that the APT plan remains the preferable option. <lb/>A further challenge that countries face when assessing the use of the 700 MHz for mobile <lb/>communications services is the bandwidth needed by broadcasting services, even though the technological <lb/>evolution of broadcasting standards (e.g. DVB-T2, MPEG4, HEVC) or increased multiplexing rations may <lb/>partly address these concerns. Another challenge may be other incumbent users of this band in some <lb/>countries, such as programme making and special events applications (PMSE). <lb/>More generally, a number of issues need to be considered when governments design band plans and <lb/>technical conditions for a given band (Box 1). Economies of scale arising from regional and global <lb/>standards are an important criterion, but they have to be balanced against other constraints, such as <lb/>possible interference with other services in neighbouring bands, international co-ordination of frequencies <lb/>between neighbouring countries and existing allocations or deployments in a given country. For the latter <lb/>case, the existence of public emergency services deployed in a certain band, which are costly to migrate, <lb/>may be a strong reason for a country to prefer one band plan over another. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Australia&apos;s 700 MHz band harmonisation <lb/>In June 2010, the Australian Government announced that it would release 126 MHz of broadcasting spectrum <lb/>between 694 MHz and 820 MHz as a digital dividend. Subsequent to this decision, the Australian Communications <lb/>and Media Authority (ACMA) commenced preparing the spectrum for sale. A critical part of this work was to decide <lb/>the fundamental band plan upon which the new spectrum licences would be based. As a technology-taker with a <lb/>comparatively small population, harmonisation is a key driver in Australia&apos;s international spectrum engagements. <lb/>In considering the optimal band plan for Australia, the ACMA identified a number of priorities, including: selecting a <lb/>band plan that would maximise efficiency and utility of the spectrum -with a key objective being the ability of the <lb/>frequency arrangements to provide for channels of up to 20 MHz (desirable for Long Term Evolution (LTE) <lb/>technology), as well as realisation of the benefits of economies of scale and roaming through spectrum harmonisation. <lb/>The ACMA considered these priorities against existing digital dividend band plans. While the United States digital <lb/>dividend (698–806 MHz) frequency range largely aligns with Australia&apos;s, the United States 700 MHz band plan did <lb/>not meet Australia&apos;s objective of providing channels up to 20 MHz or maximise efficiency to the extent desired by <lb/>Australia (because of its interleaved small blocks of spectrum, requiring more guard bands than a single contiguous <lb/>block and making handset design more complex). The European band plan was also considered, but was found to be <lb/>unsuitable for Australia as there is only a partial overlap (790–820 MHz) between the European and Australian digital <lb/>dividend frequency ranges. <lb/>For the first time, a specific Asia-Pacific harmonised digital dividend band plan was considered. Australia, led by the <lb/>ACMA, was a key driver in this undertaking, working with other Region Three countries within the Asia-Pacific <lb/>Telecommunity Wireless Group (AWG) to develop the band plans. <lb/>There are two Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) 700 MHz plans, one for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) <lb/>technologies and one for Time Division Duplex (TDD) technologies. The APT band plans were refined over a period <lb/>of two years, during which time numerous related studies were conducted (including band edge studies), before being <lb/>finally agreed in September 2011. Both band plans have been adopted as part of the LTE standard by the international <lb/>3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and maximise efficient use of the spectrum. <lb/>Australia has adopted the FDD version of the APT band plan, which identifies two 45 MHz segments of paired <lb/>spectrum within 703–803 MHz, optimised for mobile broadband. It offers the opportunity for significant economies <lb/>of scale, enabling cheaper devices and international roaming benefits. <lb/>APT FDD 700 MHz plan <lb/>The ACMA has been working to promote the APT band plan throughout Region 2 and Region 3, with a large number <lb/>of countries across the Asia–Pacific region now committed to, or seriously considering, its adoption. Currently, some <lb/>20 countries including Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New <lb/>Guinea and Singapore, have announced adoption of the plan or variants of it that will retain much, if not all, of the <lb/>harmonisation benefits. Other APT countries such as Cambodia and Thailand are all also actively considering the <lb/>adoption of the APT band plan. Outside of the APT community, major interest in the APT plan has been shown by <lb/>African and Middle Eastern countries. Numerous Latin American countries have adopted, or indicated an intention to <lb/>adopt, the plan including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Guam, Panama, Peru and <lb/>Venezuela. The plan also has the potential to influence consideration on the use of the 700 MHz band for mobile in <lb/>ITU Region 1, which includes Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Russia. This issue is agenda item 1.2 for the 2015 <lb/>World Radiocommunications Conference. <lb/>The APT 700 MHz band plan has the opportunity to be the most highly harmonised band for mobile broadband <lb/>internationally and offers the potential for markets of several hundreds of millions of subscribers. The resulting <lb/>economies of scale for APT band plan-compliant devices are expected to be substantial, with corresponding economic <lb/>and consumer benefits. <lb/></body>

			<body>An example of the complexities of achieving a harmonised band at the national level and the <lb/>associated interoperability requirements is the 700 MHz band in the United States (Box 2). <lb/>Box 2. Cost and benefits of a harmonised band at national level <lb/>In 2012, the FCC sought comment on the possibility of promoting interoperability in the lower 700 MHz band (FCC, <lb/>2012). According to the United States band plan, the 700 MHz band is comprised of 108 MHz of spectrum: 70 MHz <lb/>of commercial, non-guard band spectrum, 24 MHz of public safety spectrum, 10 MHz of spectrum to be reallocated <lb/>for public safety use, and 4 MHz of guard band spectrum. The lower 700 MHz spectrum band contains 48 MHz of <lb/>spectrum, divided into five spectrum blocks (A to E). In turn, the 3GPP has developed standards for LTE in the lower <lb/>700 MHz band, namely in two different 3GPP operating band classes in order to address interference issues (A block <lb/>is adjacent to the television channel 51, and exclusion zones in the uplink are adjacent to potential high power uses in <lb/>the E block on the downlink): Band Class 12 and Band Class 17. Band Class 12 covers the lower A, B and C blocks, <lb/>and is held by Verizon and small carriers. Band class 17 covers the lower B and C blocks, where AT&amp;T has a <lb/>significant spectrum holding. A number of lower A block licensees argued that, as a consequence of economies of <lb/>scale, equipment makers had little incentive to provide equipment for them to operate in these bands. They also <lb/>argued that there was no technical reason, from an interference perspective, for the existence of Band Class 17. The <lb/>supporters of Band Class 17 filtering argued that it was needed to tackle potential interference with TV Channel 51 <lb/>and high power E block operations. <lb/>In particular, the proponents of interoperability in the lower 700 MHz bands seek to freeze the distribution of any <lb/>equipment not capable of accommodating all band plans in the lower 700 MHz band (hence those supporting Band <lb/>Class 17 only would be banned from the market), so that all devices operating in this band would be interoperable, in <lb/>the sense that they would all operate on all the lower 700 MHz spectrum blocks. The main opponents to the <lb/>interoperability obligation, AT&amp;T and Verizon, as well as device manufacturers such as Qualcomm and the <lb/>manufacturers association TIA, argued that interoperability does not fix the interference problem, that it could delay <lb/>the deployment process and increase device cost. They also argued that requiring interoperability would have <lb/>undermined future investment in 3GPP standards, and that the current standards are technologically sound. <lb/>On 10 September 2013, a number of the principal wireless providers licensed in the band, along with the Competitive <lb/>Carriers Association, announced a voluntary industry solution that would resolve the lack of interoperability in the <lb/>Lower 700 MHz band. On 25 October 2013, the FCC adopted an order that took steps to implement the industry <lb/>solution, based on its finding that the voluntary agreement would serve the public interest by encouraging the efficient <lb/>use of spectrum and enabling consumers to enjoy the benefits of greater competition. The Commission&apos;s order <lb/>addressed interference concerns raised in the proceeding by modifying the technical rules for the D and E blocks, so <lb/>as to remove the likelihood of harm caused by attendant power levels while continuing to allow high-value uses of <lb/>these blocks. The order concluded that interference from adjacent channel 51 operations was unlikely to disturb B <lb/>and C block operations and was not an impediment to interoperability. The order proposed to modify AT&amp;T&apos;s B and <lb/>C block licenses to incorporate AT&amp;T&apos;s commitments to help achieve lower 700 MHz interoperability and made <lb/>changes to construction requirements and deadlines for A, B. and E block licensees. <lb/>While this issue was resolved by a complicated, multi-part voluntary agreement that provides for interoperability, the <lb/>episode nonetheless clearly illustrates the complexities of achieving device interoperability, as well as the technical <lb/>and economic and country-and band-specificity of the issues. Lack of interoperability can slow device production <lb/>and reduce economies of scale, while leaving the smaller carriers with fewer device options to choose, which <lb/>eventually harm consumers. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>Regional vs. global harmonisation <lb/>Spectrum harmonisation may take place at the global (e.g. ITU) or the regional level (e.g. CEPT, <lb/>APT/CITEL, the European Union), in addition to band harmonisation within a country (which may be <lb/>important for larger countries) or bilateral talks to ensure spectrum compatibility across borders. All three <lb/>levels impose constraints on the whole process. For example, some regions, such as the European Union <lb/>area or, more broadly, the CEPT, may pursue regional harmonisation plans so that interference mitigation <lb/>is facilitated by ensuring that all countries in that region undertake spectrum transition at the same time. <lb/>Regional economic unions, such as the European Union, may have broader economic objectives such <lb/>as pursuing a single market, which would be significantly favoured by harmonised band plans. In this <lb/>respect, the European Union and the CEPT work closely to assist each other in bringing forward greater <lb/>harmonisation in Europe. For example, the CEPT received the mandate from the European Commission to <lb/>develop technical conditions for the use of the 700 MHz band by wireless broadband and emergency <lb/>services, which will have to be ready for 2015. In particular, CEPT was mandated to develop a preferred <lb/>technical arrangement and to identify common and minimal (least restrictive) technical conditions for <lb/>wireless broadband use in this band, subject to a precise definition of the lower band edge, to avoid <lb/>interference in adjacent bands (in compliance with the harmonised conditions for the 800 MHz), and to <lb/>facilitate cross-border co-ordination. <lb/>In order to guarantee broader policy goals such as the accomplishment of the single market, some <lb/>bands are harmonised at the European level by the European Commission (assisted by the CEPT), to allow <lb/>for a co-ordinated approach in terms of technical conditions and migration paths. Even though this may <lb/>delay migration to new uses in some countries, the above-mentioned benefits prevail and support regional <lb/>spectrum harmonisation in some cases. As noted above, there is currently no clear globally agreed policy <lb/>as to favouring regional over global harmonisation, even though global harmonisation is a long-term <lb/>desirable goal and regional and national harmonisation a suboptimal outcome. <lb/>Advancing regional harmonisation may also help leverage a higher bargaining power in international <lb/>negotiations. As some have noted (NTIA, 2008) the adoption of globally harmonised bands may be an <lb/>option for some countries, notably the largest economies, while a must for others. Despite larger countries <lb/>having this possibility, increased recognition of the benefits of band harmonisation is taking place <lb/>worldwide. In the United States, the PCAST report notes, for example, that this country should make <lb/>international harmonisation of spectrum allocations to wireless broadband, particularly in bands used or <lb/>planned to be used for mobile broadband communications, a key element of its future position at WRC-15 <lb/>and in bilateral and regional discussions with its own neighbours, Mexico and Canada. <lb/>Despite this rising trend, band harmonisation negotiations and migration are lengthy processes, which <lb/>may take many years to negotiate, develop and implement, and that need to consider many of the existing <lb/>constraints such as incumbent uses, interference from neighbouring bands and international co-ordination. <lb/>SHARED USE OF SPECTRUM: DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES <lb/>An additional way to maximise spectrum efficiency <lb/>This report examines a number of ways to increase the amount of spectrum resources available for <lb/>communication services and related uses, including by increasing its efficiency. In that respect, spectrum <lb/>sharing seeks to better exploit a part of this resource that may be underutilised or with innovative <lb/>approaches could be exploited to a greater extent. Spectrum sharing is already being used in some cases <lb/>and is constantly innovating. To accomplish this goal there is a need to examine regulatory instruments that <lb/>may not have been fully exploited to date and that may address some of the current challenges associated <lb/></body>

			<body>with the increasing demand for spectrum. Shared use of spectrum, whether license-exempt or licensed, is <lb/>already widely utilised in some circumstances (e.g. Wi-Fi networks, wireless microphones, private mobile <lb/>radio, fixed service), but there is a growing advocacy for such opportunities to cover some specific bands <lb/>that are now used for other services and to raise the awareness of policy makers on the opportunities <lb/>created by spectrum sharing. <lb/>An element in these discussions is, however, whether spectrum sharing is authorised in a license-<lb/>exempt or licensed environment (including through light licensing), as both approaches have pros and cons. <lb/>Traditionally, mobile operators have argued for a fully licensed, exclusive use of spectrum as a basis to <lb/>underpin their business models and provide legal certainty. On the other hand, in the area of proximity <lb/>networks, the benefits of license-exempt use (i.e. general authorisation in some jurisdictions) have proved a <lb/>tremendous success enabling applications such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and wireless microphones (Benkler, <lb/>2012). Mobile operators themselves widely use Wi-Fi offloading techniques to optimise the performance <lb/>of their networks (OECD, 2013, WIK-Consult, 2013). Wi-Fi is now embedded in all smartphones and <lb/>tablets. <lb/>The established practice is that indoor coverage in mobile networks is provided through outdoor base <lb/>stations (macro cells) but the fundamental problem is that most mobile broadband capacity is consumed <lb/>indoors and/or within the local area. This suggests that some frequencies could be shared to provide indoor <lb/>capacity at the local area level, for example through femto-cells. This requires network sharing <lb/>management, and thus the use of a combination of different types of spectrum licensing approaches <lb/>simultaneously. <lb/>Whatever approach is favoured, this report starts from the assumption that careful spectrum <lb/>inventories could be undertaken in order to assess possible spectrum supply to accommodate new <lb/>applications and, against policy goals, the possibilities of shared use in each of the bands, in light of current <lb/>uses. This assessment can be based on different scenarios depending on the applications that require access <lb/>to the spectrum. Authorised shared access/licensed shared access (ASA/LSA), as defined in this section <lb/>may become an increasing opportunity to accommodate new spectrum capacity needs, provided that a <lb/>balanced approach and sufficient certainty are provided for all stakeholders involved. 6 Another very <lb/>important benefit from spectrum inventories is a clear picture of the extent to which spectrum resources are <lb/>being actually utilised, which could highlight opportunities for sharing. The practical implementation of <lb/>spectrum inventories needs to be carefully assessed, as they can become relatively complex and involve <lb/>onerous implications for regulators and licensees. In any event, a detailed implementation plan and a cost-<lb/>benefit analysis could be undertaken. <lb/>In this new environment, rights and obligations of each type of spectrum user could be clearly defined. <lb/>First, the new licensing environment (or license-exempt) must be backed by spectrum compatibility <lb/>evidence and scenario-based analysis of the possible licensing frameworks. In addition, any possible <lb/>implementation of shared use of spectrum may have to be aligned with other spectrum policy goals, such <lb/>as spectrum harmonisation of bands at a regional, or even global level, to enhance economies of scale. In <lb/>that respect, for example, opening a band for license-exempt use may undermine efforts to clear and <lb/>harmonise a given band for exclusive licensed use. <lb/>Which licensing regime? <lb/>Beyond the overarching principles to which spectrum policy should adhere, such as observing, to the <lb/>extent possible, technological and service neutrality, ensuring the highest degree of legal certainty for <lb/>market players and other stakeholders, or providing transparent, clear conditions for the use of spectrum <lb/>resources, the reality is that spectrum licensing schemes do not always achieve these goals. Clearly, history <lb/>and legacy regulation play a role as does regulatory inertia or resistance to change. The overall situation <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>becomes increasingly complex as spectrum is a strategic asset for governments, with far-reaching <lb/>implications on national security, defence and the provision of basic public services, such as emergency <lb/>assistance. Nonetheless, spectrum regimes in OECD countries evolve and adapt to new technologies as <lb/>well as the need to accommodate market mechanisms to promote the more efficient use of spectrum. <lb/>Traditionally, the role of government in spectrum management can be categorised into three major <lb/>approaches: i) command and control; ii) market mechanisms; and iii) license exemption. As a matter of <lb/>fact, these three approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are their designations fully accurate or <lb/>mutually exclusive, but they serve the purpose of a broad categorisation of recent spectrum management. <lb/>For example, license exemption is subject to complying with some regulations, i.e. on transmitter and <lb/>receiver power limits, whereby individual licensing schemes do incorporate some market mechanisms, <lb/>such as trading of rights of use. Market mechanisms include spectrum trading, which plays a significant <lb/>role in the United States wireless market but has not been very successful elsewhere to date, especially in <lb/>Europe (with some exceptions such as the trade of rights of use in the 3.5 GHz band by operators and local <lb/>authorities in France). <lb/>The Electronic Communications Committee of the CEPT provides a different categorisation of these <lb/>approaches, based on the licensing schemes, focusing on the requirements of the authorisations/licenses <lb/>granted for the use of spectrum (Table 1). <lb/>Table 1. Regulatory options towards spectrum licensing <lb/>Individual authorisation <lb/>(Individual rights of use) <lb/>General authorisation <lb/>(No individual rights of use) <lb/>Individual license <lb/>Light licensing <lb/>License exempt <lb/>Individual frequency <lb/>planning / co-ordination <lb/>Traditional procedure for <lb/>issuing licenses <lb/>Individual frequency <lb/>planning / co-ordination <lb/>Simplified procedure <lb/>compared to traditional <lb/>procedure for issuing <lb/>licenses <lb/>With limitations in the <lb/>number of users <lb/>No individual frequency <lb/>planning / co-ordination <lb/>Registration and/or <lb/>notification <lb/>No limitations in the <lb/>number of users nor need <lb/>for co-ordination <lb/>No individual frequency <lb/>planning / co-ordination <lb/>No registration nor <lb/>Notification <lb/>Source: OECD, based on ECO (ECC Report 132) <lb/>Policy makers are recommended to not only pursue one option towards maximising the amount of <lb/>spectrum available for communications and its efficiency. This report encourages them to advance <lb/>initiatives in different areas, while ensuring consistency. One of these approaches is the shared use of <lb/>spectrum, whereby several users may have access to the same spectrum resources, on a license-exempt <lb/>(unlicensed) or licensed basis. <lb/>There are several approaches between a pure &quot; command and control &quot; model, i.e. a traditional <lb/>licensing scheme, and license-exempt use of spectrum. Unlicensed bands also involve requirements, such <lb/>as standard compliance, as the devices may not cause harmful interference nor request protection against <lb/>interference. Wi-Fi technologies in the 2.4 GHz (band designated for industrial, scientific and medical -<lb/>ISM-use) and 5 GHz bands and applications in the 800/900 MHz band, are the most significant example <lb/>of unlicensed bands. Wireless microphones, radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems, medical <lb/>equipment, or smart grid communications make use of license-exempt spectrum. The development and use <lb/>of Wi-Fi is one of the most successful examples of the use of unlicensed and shared spectrum. Today, it is <lb/>not only used by millions of users around the world it is playing an increasing role in areas such as <lb/></body>

			<body>offloading mobile traffic on to fixed networks (Comscore, 2012). 7 In Australia, this type of regulation for <lb/>spectrum is referred to as &quot; class licensed spectrum &quot; . <lb/>Many have wondered to what extent unlicensed bands suffer congestion or diminishing quality of <lb/>service. A consultancy report undertaken for Ofcom in 2009 found that the majority of problems <lb/>experienced by Wi-Fi users in the 2.4 GHz band were not spectrum-related, but mostly due to <lb/>configuration issues or problems with the wired Internet (MASS Consultants Limited, 2009). The report <lb/>said, however, that some inner city locations, such as in central London, exhibited signs of congestion and <lb/>interference, which they said was expected to increase. Wi-Fi in the 5 GHz band is less condensed and has <lb/>much more bandwidth, enabling non-overlapping channels and higher throughput. <lb/>According to the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG), &quot; Collective Use of Spectrum (CUS) allows <lb/>an unlimited number of independent users and devices to access spectrum in the same range of designated <lb/>CUS frequencies at the same time and in a particular geographic area under a well-defined set of <lb/>conditions. &quot; A well-known example of successful CUS implementation is the 863-870 MHz band in <lb/>Europe, used by remote control devices, wireless microphones, hearing aids, RFID, audio transceivers, <lb/>alarms, etc. As opposed to ASA/LSA, CUS does not grant exclusive access to spectrum nor provide <lb/>interference protection from other users (RSPG, 2011). <lb/>Authorised shared access/licensed shared access <lb/>Even though a systematic approach towards maximising spectrum availability for wireless broadband <lb/>would suggest targeting bands used for public purposes (defence, aeronautical, and so forth), clearing these <lb/>may entail significant costs and long transitions. In 2010, for example, the President of the United States <lb/>issued a Presidential Memorandum entitled &quot; Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution &quot; requiring <lb/>that the Federal Government make available 500 MHz of federal or non-federal spectrum for both mobile <lb/>and fixed wireless broadband use by commercial users within a decade (United States White House, 2010). <lb/>In March 2012, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) concluded that <lb/>clearing just one 95 MHz band by relocating existing Federal users to other parts of the spectrum would <lb/>take 10 years, cost some USD 18 billion, and cause significant disruption to incumbent users (NTIA, 2012). <lb/>In 2011, against this background, an industry consortium put forward a new framework to share <lb/>spectrum based on the concept of licensed or authorised shared access. Qualcomm and Nokia Siemens <lb/>Networks (NSN) propose a concept, Authorised Shared Access (ASA), a framework to share spectrum <lb/>between a limited numbers of users. Under this concept, the existing spectrum user(s) ( &quot; the incumbent(s) &quot; ) <lb/>would share spectrum with one or several licensed ASA users ( &quot; ASA licensee(s) &quot; ) in accordance with a set <lb/>of pre-defined conditions. <lb/>These conditions may be static (e.g. specific exclusion zone or time allowed for operation) or dynamic <lb/>(e.g. geographic/time sharing, on-demand authorisation by ASA licensees or on-demand restrictions <lb/>imposed by incumbents). Dynamic implementation of ASA takes advantage of the recent advances in <lb/>geolocation and database technologies, allowing spectrum sharing on a frequency, location and time <lb/>sharing basis. However, in the case of the incumbent(s) imposing restrictions, a system for updating, <lb/>maintaining and providing the access conditions would first need to be established. The CEPT is <lb/>contributing to the harmonisation of the 2.3, 3.4-3.6 and 3.6-3.8 GHz bands for IMT and IMT-Advanced <lb/>systems, covering various scenarios. 8 <lb/>According to the proposed ASA arrangement, band sharing would not be static and it would probably <lb/>involve some compensation to the incumbent user in exchange for some quality of service (QoS). An ASA <lb/>approach could benefit from dynamic assignment of channels, which could lead to a higher degree of <lb/>spectrum utilisation. ASA also differs from the emerging &quot; white space &quot; model in that the channel <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>borrowers would be limited in number, licensed and subject to sharing rules included in their rights of use. <lb/>Under white space devices (WSD) rules, there are no negotiations with incumbents and the number of <lb/>opportunistic users is unlimited and their identities unknown, which for some increases concerns about <lb/>possible interference and the practicality of tackling them. Another possible advantage of ASA is that it is <lb/>implemented at the network level without any impact on devices, thus avoiding lengthy processes relating <lb/>to device development. This facilitates a faster time to market and the achievement of economies of scale. <lb/>In Europe, shared and collective use of spectrum is widespread, including shared use for civil and <lb/>military applications. In 2012 the European Commission has issued a Communication on &quot; Promoting the <lb/>shared use of radio spectrum resources in the internal market &quot; . The CEPT and the RSPG, are considering <lb/>the refined regulatory approach of ASA, the so-called &quot; Licensed Shared Access &quot; (LSA). &quot; Licensed shared <lb/>access &quot; (LSA) aims to foster the potential to share spectrum, not only limited to the IMT bands, in a <lb/>harmonised manner under a licensed regime. According to the RSPG definition, LSA is as &quot; a regulatory <lb/>approach aiming to facilitate the introduction of radio communication systems operated by a limited <lb/>number of licensees under an individual licensing regime in a frequency band already assigned or <lb/>expected to be assigned to one or more incumbent users. Under the LSA approach, the additional users are <lb/>authorised to use the spectrum (or part of the spectrum) in accordance with sharing rules included in their <lb/>rights of use of spectrum, thereby allowing all the authorised users, including incumbents, to provide a <lb/>certain Quality of Service (QoS) &quot; , (RSPG, 2013). Hence, over the CUS, the LSA gives some rights to a <lb/>new user. The concept still needs to be put into practice. The 2.3-2.4 GHz band is under consideration by <lb/>the CEPT, which is currently developing regulatory provisions based on LSA. LSA aims to facilitate the <lb/>introduction of new users requiring certain QoS in a frequency band, while ensuring the long-term <lb/>incumbent use. <lb/>In the United States, two reports from the President&apos;s Council of Economic Advisors in Science and <lb/>Technology (PCAST) and from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) <lb/>have been major drivers towards the increased shared use of spectrum. The PCAST report &quot; Realizing the <lb/>full potential of government-held spectrum to spur economic growth &quot; found that clearing and reallocation <lb/>of Federal spectrum is not sustainable due to high cost, lengthy implementation and possible disruption. It <lb/>sets as a priority the recommendation that the United States Secretary of Commerce immediately identifies <lb/>1 000 MHz of Federal spectrum in which to implement the new architecture and thereby create the first <lb/>shared-use spectrum superhighways, thereby advancing the President&apos;s directive from 2010. The report <lb/>strongly highlights that the norm for spectrum use should be sharing, not exclusivity. Moreover, spectrum <lb/>management should focus on avoiding fragmentation, by specifying &quot; large frequency bands that can <lb/>accommodate a wide variety of compatible uses and new technologies that are more efficient with larger <lb/>blocks of spectrum. &quot; It draws attention to the fact that spectrum, in the United States, is largely fragmented <lb/>which prevents the use of these larger bands in that country. The recommendations represent a change <lb/>from previous approaches and are not supported by all players in the wireless industry. As mentioned in <lb/>the section on spectrum harmonisation, this situation is rooted in historical reasons and in a higher degree <lb/>of flexibility in spectrum allocations in that country. <lb/>The PCAST report recommends that policies enabling commercial access to Federal spectrum be <lb/>based primarily on their potential benefits for innovation and growth in wireless devices, services and <lb/>associated markets, treating direct revenue considerations as secondary. More specifically, recom-<lb/>mendation 7.1 of the PCAST report recommends that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), <lb/>together with the NTIA, start the process to modify the rules to allow &quot; general authorised access &quot; devices <lb/>to operate in two bands in the NTIA Fast Track list, specifically the 3 550-3 650 MHz (radar) band and <lb/>another to be determined by the NTIA and FCC. <lb/></body>

			<body>In a similar framework to that of ASA, the FCC has put forward a Notice for Proposed Rulemaking <lb/>(NRPM) to allow shared use of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band, in line with the PCAST recommendation. <lb/>The NPRM proposes a scheme for shared use of spectrum and small cells, and seeks comment on the <lb/>possible arrangements for implementation. The FCC proposes a multi-tiered shared access model, by <lb/>means of a spectrum access system (SAS) with a dynamic database managing the new &quot; Citizens <lb/>Broadband Service &quot; . This service is aimed at tackling capacity shortages. The initial proposed model has <lb/>three tiers of service: i) Incumbent Access, ii) Priority Access; and iii) General Authorised Access (GAA). <lb/>It could be noted that the proposed three-tiered access model departs from ASA&apos;s two-tiered proposal and <lb/>allows for a third type of user. <lb/>The Incumbent Access tier would only consist of authorised federal users of the band, which would be <lb/>protected from harmful interference. Other users would not be permitted to operate in areas designated for <lb/>incumbent use. The Priority Access tier would include small cell use by certain users (priority users), <lb/>which could deliver a certain quality of service to specific locations. As it stands now, the proposal only <lb/>includes hospital, state and local government as explicit users of this access tier. Priority users would be <lb/>obliged to register and would be entitled to protection for interference. Finally, the General Authorised <lb/>Access tier would be assigned to the general public on a best-effort, non-interfering basis, without any <lb/>entitlement to protection from interference, within designated geographic areas. Residential and business <lb/>users, as well as service providers, would fall within this access tier. GAA users would also need to register. <lb/>A further option proposed by the FCC is to extend the band use for GAA use to the 3 650-3 700 MHz <lb/>band, currently used by wireless Internet service providers on a non-exclusive basis. If implemented, these <lb/>users would switch from non-exclusive licenses to the license-by-the-rule framework proposed. This holds <lb/>significant potential for small cell application, in particular regarding geographic sharing, especially in <lb/>those cases where long distance reach is not critical. <lb/>Figure 2. FCC&apos;s proposed sharing scheme for the 3.5 GHz band <lb/>Source: FCC, NPRM, 12 December 2012. <lb/>New spectrum technologies <lb/>The development of new technologies, such as cognitive radio techniques – beacons, geolocation <lb/>databases, sensing, and so forth – have allowed the establishment of communications when the channels <lb/>are available. In 1999, Mitola and Maguire proposed the first software defined radio (SDR) architecture, <lb/>which consisted of a pair of data converters, providing the maximum flexibility and programmability <lb/>through the digital processing block (Mitola and Maguire, 1999). What they called &quot; radio etiquette &quot; is the <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>set of radiofrequency bands, protocols, and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate the use of the radio <lb/>spectrum, thus becoming an excellent platform for providing cognitive radio. <lb/>The International Telecommunications Union has provided definitions for these new technologies, in <lb/>order to provide some clarity in the use of these terms (ITU, 2012): <lb/>Software Defined radio (SDR): &quot; A radio transmitter and/or receiver employing a technology that <lb/>allows the RF operating parameters including, but not limited to, frequency range, modulation <lb/>type, or output power to be set or altered by software, excluding changes to operating <lb/>parameters which occur during the normal pre-installed and predetermined operation of a radio <lb/>according to a system specification or standard. &quot; <lb/>Cognitive Radio System (CR): &quot; A radio system employing technology that allows the system: to <lb/>obtain knowledge of its operational and geographical environment, established policies and its <lb/>internal state; to dynamically and autonomously adjust its operational parameters and protocols <lb/>according to its obtained knowledge in order to achieve predefined objectives; and to learn from <lb/>the results obtained. &quot; <lb/>There are various techniques possible to get information about the radio environment, for example <lb/>sensing, cognitive pilot channel (CPC), or databases. There are also the so-called pre-cognitive <lb/>technologies, such as Ultra-wide band Dynamic Frequency Selection (UWB DFS), Detect-and-Avoid <lb/>(DAA) or RLAN DFS (used for radio local area networks). By using DFS, the equipment will search for a <lb/>different free channel as soon as it detects that the requested channel is occupied. 9 These techniques are <lb/>used, for example, in the 5 GHz operation of Wi-Fi, as there is some interference from radar systems in <lb/>that band. <lb/>The CEPT&apos;s Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) has been studying ASA/LSA since 2011. <lb/>In October 2012, the CEPT Working Group on Frequency management (CEPT WGFM) decided to further <lb/>develop the necessary regulatory framework to enable ASA/LSA. It established two project teams (FM52 <lb/>and FM53) to study, respectively: i) the 2.3-2.4 GHz band toward a draft ECC Decision and <lb/>Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RRS); and ii) Licensed Shared Access (LSA) toward an ECC Report on <lb/>general conditions and band-specific conditions for the implementation of the LSA, establishing the <lb/>relevant interaction with ETSI. The ECC Report 205 on LSA is now published and under public <lb/>consultation and the ECC decision on the 2.3-2.4 GHz bank in its final stage (ECC, 2013). Finally the <lb/>ETSI RRS Technical Body has developed a System Reference Document for mobile broadband in the 2.3-<lb/>2.4 GHz band under the LSA regime with the objective of developing expected usage scenarios, technical <lb/>characteristics/frequency arrangements and regulatory provisions related to compliance. <lb/> &quot; Spectrum holes &quot; , also known as &quot; white spaces &quot; , are sub-bands of the radio spectrum that are <lb/>underutilised at a particular instant of time and specific geographic location. A wireless device may <lb/>identify spectrum holes in three ways: i) by consulting databases which contain information on the <lb/>availability of spectrum holes in its local neighbourhood; or ii) by sensing the radio spectrum in its local <lb/>neighbourhood in an unsupervised manner; or iii) by using beacons. The beacon approach requires the <lb/>transmission from some appropriate infrastructure of a signal providing information on the availability of <lb/>spectrum holes at the location of the device. In 2009, Ofcom concluded, based on responses received from <lb/>a consultation, that the beacon approach was the least appropriate and did not merit further investigation <lb/>for taking advantage of unused interleaved spectrum (white spaces). Ofcom also concluded that the use of <lb/>databases was the most promising approach, possibly to be complemented in the future with sensing by the <lb/>wireless device. <lb/></body>

			<body>Cognitive radio systems are being standardised at all levels, including at the ITU&apos;s Working Party 1B, <lb/>various IEEE&apos;s 802 working groups (definitions at 802.11 and 802.22 and components at 802.19, 802.21 <lb/>and 802.22). Moreover, the IEEE&apos;s DySPAN standards committee, whose predecessor is the IEEE P1900 <lb/>is developing standards for radio spectrum management with a focus on improved use of spectrum. The <lb/>ETSI&apos;s Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RSS) Technical Committee (TC) is also active in the field. The <lb/>CEPT&apos;s Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) is actively working in cognitive radio issues, by <lb/>means of the SE43 group, devoted to the discussion of white spaces devices, the Project Team FM, which <lb/>discusses white spaces and licensed shared access issues, as well as a correspondence group on cognitive <lb/>radio. In addition, many of the projects of the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission <lb/>(FP7) address the research topic &quot; cognitive radio &quot; . <lb/>At present, equipment enabled to select the most interference-free operating frequency is widely <lb/>available. The trend towards dynamic spectrum use means that spectrum allocation policies may need a <lb/>major overhaul to take into account the implications of these technologies and to increase spectrum <lb/>efficiency. <lb/>In the midst of rapid technological evolution, spectrum management could also facilitate the transition <lb/>of the use of spectrum from less to more valuable applications. In this regard, &quot; light licensing &quot; schemes or <lb/>the proposed ASA/LSA approaches may contribute to this goal, in a context where spectrum trading may <lb/>be too costly, uncertain to implement or not accepted by the market. On the other hand, when spectrum is <lb/>available or can be cleared in a reasonable timeframe, many mobile network operators clearly prefer <lb/>individual licensing schemes, which would make it easier to guarantee certain quality of service. For <lb/>example, ASA proponents argue that this model involves a full set of rights and obligations for the licensee, <lb/>guaranteeing legal certainty and quality of service while ensuring protection against interference for the <lb/>incumbent. MNOs have, however, strongly relied on unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum to undertake Wi-Fi off-<lb/>loading, which shows the benefits of unlicensed spectrum as a complement to individual licensing and a <lb/>potential driver for innovation. <lb/>What spectrum managers are now considering is whether ASA/LSA schemes could add a <lb/>supplementary licensing scheme, which would complement the existing two, i.e. exclusive licensed and <lb/>licensed-exempt. On the one hand, it would facilitate monitoring and congestion management, as it would <lb/>require licensing and the number of licenses would be limited. On the other hand, it would allow for <lb/>sufficient flexibility in using vacant spectrum resources in the time or space domains. <lb/>Some mobile network operators have argued that LSA could be applied to frequency bands that could <lb/>not otherwise be exploited for commercial purposes in the short term (e.g. band clearing/refarming is not <lb/>possible in the short term). <lb/>The definition of &quot; incumbent users &quot; <lb/>Spectrum is, of course, allocated to many public users. This includes areas such as emergency <lb/>services, aeronautical use, the military and so forth, which essentially provide public goods that are <lb/>challenging to value in financial terms. Nascent schemes to value spectrum used by the public sector are <lb/>positive steps towards achieving a more efficient use of spectrum. In particular, administrative incentive <lb/>pricing (AIP), implemented in Canada and in the United Kingdom, provides an effective tool for public <lb/>users to value their spectrum holdings and an incentive for them to improve efficiency. <lb/>A recurrent concept used by the proponents of ASA/LSA approaches is that of &quot; incumbent &quot; . Under <lb/>the LSA framework, &quot; an incumbent is a current holder of spectrum rights of use &quot; . Some industry <lb/>stakeholders, e.g. Qualcomm/Nokia, GSMA, argue for a definition of an &quot; incumbent &quot; spectrum holder or <lb/>users as an entity that has been awarded spectrum resources as a result of a non-competitive tendering <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>process (i.e. government users). A mobile network operator proposed the definition of &quot; a current holder of <lb/>spectrum rights for non-commercial purposes or governmental use &quot; . According to the former views, <lb/>mobile network operators would be excluded as they have been authorised to use spectrum based on an <lb/>open auction, beauty contest or first come first served procedure. In the view of these proponents, the use <lb/>of bands under ASA could be binary by nature, thus only allowing use by the incumbent or, should the <lb/>band remain unused at a particular point in time or at a geographical location, only be used by MNOs. <lb/>This departs from some of the proposed approaches such as the FCC&apos;s NPRM for the 3.5 GHz band, <lb/>the Communication of the European Commission on &quot; Promoting the shared use of radio spectrum <lb/>resources in the internal market &quot; , and the recent regulation for the 1 900 MHz band enforced in the <lb/>Netherlands in 2013, where 5 MHz of spectrum in the 1800 MHz (GSM) band were opened for license-<lb/>exempt, low power use by femtocell base stations (private GSM networks to achieve indoor and outdoor <lb/>coverage). The Netherlands had tested the regulation on a trial-basis for three years with a smaller <lb/>spectrum band (part of the DECT-guard band) and organisations had to register their use. <lb/>After three years, 3 000 organisations had deployed their own base stations, which was seen as a <lb/>success and a sign of strong market demand. To stimulate this use, the government opened up extra <lb/>spectrum and removed the registration requirement. Using this solution, companies can save money on <lb/>their calling costs, by handling in-company calls and external calls and routing it via the fixed network. <lb/>Hospitals use this solution, because it offers better indoor coverage than DECT cordless phones. Event <lb/>locations, like stadiums and exposition centres, use it to separate the mobile telephony of their personnel <lb/>from that of the visitors, so that the personnel are not affected by an overloaded network during an event. <lb/>Other uses of the spectrum might be for mobile networks to deploy their femtocells as well as for users on <lb/>the edge of network coverage (e.g. rural areas) to provide indoor coverage using self-provisioned <lb/>equipment. <lb/>Using the approach adopted by The Netherlands, a country with among the highest population density <lb/>in the OECD area, may be beneficial for other countries including those with sparsely populated areas on <lb/>the edge of network coverage. Users at a location, such as on a farm, but with rooftop coverage through an <lb/>external antenna might be able to use less expensive femtocells to provide service inside a residence or in a <lb/>surrounding building or location. While such solutions are sometimes made available by MNOs the <lb/>equipment is sometimes sold at significantly higher prices than likely to be the case if this market was open <lb/>to competitive supply as in the case in some countries. <lb/>The femtocell approach has also been used in Japan (see Box 3), with varying requirements in relation <lb/>to the freedom of consumers to install devices of their choice. Overall, it seems that relaxing the <lb/>requirements for customers to install small cells or femtocells may promote a wider adoption. These two <lb/>examples from heavily populated countries are telling in that no apparent disruption of services has <lb/>happened resulting from these light-licensing approaches, showing that these devices could be used more <lb/>widely. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Femtocells and spectrum policy in Japan <lb/>In Japan, in April 2008, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided on a policy aimed at <lb/>flexible and simple installation and operation of femtocells, by reviewing and clarifying relevant rules including the <lb/>radio law. The new approach recognised that femtocells could be used to improve coverage in small areas that receive <lb/>weak or non-existent signals, such as inside a building. <lb/>Femtocells were considered to be able to contribute to expansion of coverage inside buildings and underground areas, <lb/>such as in tunnels, where mobile operators had faced challenges to install radio base stations by themselves, through <lb/>their dedicated lines. However, the law and rules were out of date, in this regard, because they only allowed licensees <lb/>of spectrum (i.e. mobile operators) to operate base stations including femtocells, thus hindering deployment of new <lb/>equipment that could be easily controlled by users without any expertise. <lb/>Amendment to the law was enacted in May 2008 and came into force in October 2008. Relevant administrative rules <lb/>were also reviewed and modified accordingly. The main points of these modifications are as follows: <lb/>• Small base stations, such as femtocells installed inside buildings, were allowed to be licensed collectively for <lb/>each region, instead of individual licenses required for each such station before the amendment.<lb/>• Femtocells and repeaters (amplifiers) were allowed to be operated by non-qualified users who are not licensees of <lb/>spectrum, without surveillance of qualified technicians.<lb/>• Technological conditions such as power limitations that femtocells should meet were established.<lb/>• Application formats for collective licenses of femtocells and repeaters were simplified.<lb/>As a result, the three major mobile operators, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI au and Softbank mobile, began to provide their <lb/>users with femtocells from 2009 or 2010. These femtocells are connected to fixed broadband access lines to provide <lb/>additional coverage in the immediate area. KDDI also started to install repeaters that expanded coverage, by <lb/>amplifying radio waves inside buildings identified as repeaters, when more appropriate by follow-up examination. <lb/>When these services were taken up, only NTT DoCoMo required users to pay additional cost although it was a small <lb/>amount (JPY 315 = USD 3.20) although the service was suspended in September 2012. Instead, NTT currently <lb/>commits to installing a femtocell as a method to improve public coverage wherever found to be necessary, as a result <lb/>of a visit and examination to a user&apos;s premises following notification of a weak indoor signal. <lb/>For the other two mobile operators, femtocell installation and operation has been free of charge from the outset except <lb/>for electricity cost and the fixed broadband charge. It is also provided in response to user&apos;s notification of a weak <lb/>signal and a follow-up examination. NTT DoCoMo has recently developed &quot; Xi femtocell &quot; that supports LTE in <lb/>addition to 3G and started to deploy it in December 2012. <lb/>Source: http://warp.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3196220/www.soumu.go.jp/menu_news/s-news/2008/080417_2.html <lb/>http://warp.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3196220/www.soumu.go.jp/menu_news/s-news/2008/080709_6.html <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>In addition to the above-mentioned bands, the following bands (Table 2) are being targeted for a <lb/>possible implementation of LSA/ASA approaches. <lb/>Table 2. Possible spectrum bands for ASA/LSA <lb/>Band <lb/>Region/area <lb/>Current use <lb/>1 675-1 710 MHz <lb/>United States, <lb/>Europe <lb/>Meteorological aids service and <lb/>meteorological satellite service. <lb/>1 755-1 780 MHz <lb/>United States <lb/>Federal systems (fixed microwave <lb/>communications, military tactical radio <lb/>relay, air combat training, video links, <lb/>telemetry, control links, etc.) <lb/>2 300-2 400 MHz (2.3 GHz) <lb/>Europe (CEPT) <lb/>Defence/telemetry, radiolocation, <lb/>services ancillary to broadcasting <lb/>(SAB/SAP). <lb/>3 550-3 650 MHz (3.5 GHz) <lb/>United States <lb/>Radiolocation Service (RLS) and the <lb/>Aeronautical Radio Navigation Service <lb/>(ARNS) (ground-based) <lb/>3 400–3 600 and 3 600-3 800 MHz <lb/>All regions <lb/>Global identification for 3GPP E-UTRA <lb/>An issue that can arise in debates surrounding policies promoting the sharing of spectrum is the final <lb/>definition of incumbent users. To date, this has been clearly targeted at government spectrum holders or, as <lb/>ASA proponents favour, to spectrum holdings that were not granted through open, competitive tendering <lb/>processes. Nonetheless, some may want to further increase the scope for sharing, by including spectrum <lb/>holdings of mobile operators that may be underutilised. There are two major considerations in that respect. <lb/>First, operators may already do so if they so wish by reaching agreements on infrastructure sharing with <lb/>other mobile operators, which include spectrum. In principle there may not, therefore, be any need for <lb/>additional action. Second, spectrum trading has been made possible in an increasing number of markets, <lb/>although it does not seem to be playing a significant role in most of them. According to a recent survey <lb/>from the ECC/CEPT (ECC, 2011), some ten CEPT countries still maintain restrictions on spectrum trading, <lb/>for example on trade in frequency, time or geography, even though the European Union regulatory <lb/>framework allows these arrangements. Moreover, in CEPT countries where spectrum trading is possible, it <lb/>has not developed, which may indicate a lack of interest on the part of market players or, more generally, a <lb/>general need for more spectrum resources. Nonetheless, in a significant number of recent financial <lb/>transactions between operators such as take-overs or merger bids, access to spectrum is increasingly cited <lb/>as a major consideration. <lb/>While noting the existing constraints in some countries, if spectrum sharing gains momentum in other <lb/>OECD countries, private spectrum licensees – as opposed to government holders -may become more <lb/>interested in this type of transaction. There will, of course, have to be a win-win arrangement, in terms of a <lb/>fair remuneration for the party accepting to share its licensed spectrum resources or a clear case for <lb/>spectrum underutilisation, backed by an independent assessment, or both. Nonetheless, governments may <lb/>be more and more inclined to move towards these approaches if other initiatives, such as clearing and <lb/>allocating new bands on an exclusive basis, do not bear fruit or present long-standing and costly barriers <lb/>for clearance and allocation to new services. <lb/></body>

			<body>In light of the existing constraints for spectrum trading, another possibility may be that mobile <lb/>operators are subject to some degree of obligation to share their underutilised spectrum resources, under <lb/>certain conditions, which would increase spectrum efficiency. Such conditions would need to be developed <lb/>in those countries that decide to pursue this approach, but they could rely on existing requirements for <lb/>operators to achieve an acceptable efficiency in the use of spectrum resources, in order to avoid litigation. <lb/>Spectrum inventories could be used to identify underutilisation of spectrum resources and, therefore, <lb/>greater opportunities for sharing, bearing in mind the inventories&apos; practical implementation issues and <lb/>associated costs. <lb/>An earlier version of shared access – TV White Spaces <lb/>Box 4 shows some of the current examples of trials of television white space devices: <lb/>Box 4. Current situation of Television White Spaces in selected OECD countries <lb/>United States: The Federal Communication Commission&apos;s rules permit unlicensed radio devices to transmit on white <lb/>space spectrum bands used by the broadcast television service (i.e. 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-<lb/>698 MHz). In order to protect television broadcast and other licensed services operating in these bands, the rules <lb/>require the TV white space devices to obtain a list of channels available for their operation. On 1 March 2013, the <lb/>Commission&apos;s Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) authorised approved television white space database <lb/>systems to provide service to unlicensed radio devices that operate in these spectrum bands. <lb/>United Kingdom: Ofcom has been investigating possible use of white space spectrum since 2007. It preliminarily <lb/>proposed license-exempt access, taking into account geolocation information provided by databases to location-aware <lb/>white space wireless devices. As a result, Ofcom believes that license exempt devices could be authorised to use <lb/>television white spaces, provided they operated in specific frequencies and at specific powers communicated to them <lb/>by a TV white space data base (see Figure), in order to avoid harmful interference with television services operating <lb/>in these bands. On 26 April 2013 Ofcom announced plans for a pilot of innovative &apos;white space&apos; technology in the <lb/>United Kingdom and invited industry to take part in the pilot, which is intended to take place in the autumn. The <lb/>locations for the trial will be chosen once trial participants have been identified. Following a successful completion of <lb/>the pilot, Ofcom anticipates that the technology could be fully rolled out during 2014, enabling the use of white space <lb/>devices across the country. <lb/>The Cambridge White Space Consortium: This Consortium designed a trial to assist Ofcom in its proposals for a <lb/>license-exempt access to white space spectrum and to provide information on potential application in this band. Some <lb/>of the experiments focus on the protection requirements for existing devices, the elements needed in the geo-location <lb/>database, including reference geometries, coupling factors and protection ratios. They also address the presence of <lb/>PMSE (Programme Making and Special Events) devices in white space spectrum. The Consortium brings together <lb/>over 300 companies. In April 2013, Ofcom announced plans for another pilot, with a view to rolling out white space <lb/>devices technology across the United Kingdom during 2014. <lb/>…/… <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>Other pilot projects have been launched in some countries (e.g. Germany, Slovak Republic). White spaces could help <lb/>alleviate the lack of license-exempt spectrum in some regions or bands (e.g. small unlicensed 868 MHz bands in <lb/>Europe) and help release spectrum resources for a variety of uses, such as rural broadband, Wi-Fi networks with <lb/>extended reach or M2M communications. <lb/>Sources: Ofcom (2012), TVWS Consultation; Cambridge TV White Spaces Trial, &quot; A Summary of the Technical Findings &quot; , <lb/>www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/docs/Cambridge%20White%20Spaces%20Trial%20-%20technical%20findings-<lb/>with%20higher%20res%20pics.pdf <lb/>Policy makers have been examining the possibility of using spectrum segments between active <lb/>television broadcasting stations in a given area and time ( &quot; interleaved spectrum &quot; ) for wireless data <lb/>applications. As discussed, in this report, this is not the only approach that is being sought to increase the <lb/>efficiency of spectrum use, as initiatives such as administrative incentive pricing, incentive auctions and <lb/>other ways for sharing spectrum are also attracting considerable attention. Nonetheless, the televisions <lb/>white spaces discussion has been going on for some time, although the availability of devices and actual <lb/>uptake are still extremely limited. <lb/>Current provisions on Television White Spaces in the United Kingdom and the United States enable a <lb/>more flexible use of spectrum, under some conditions, although the approach departs from the proposed <lb/>ASA/LSA model in that it does not always oblige users of white spaces to register while operating in the <lb/>band, however the devices have to provide their technical details and their location to the databases. In <lb/>addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, some other countries have already engaged in <lb/>consultations regarding white space devices. In 2011, Canada consulted on white spaces and in New <lb/>Zealand the Radio Spectrum Policy and Planning group is planning to carry out a white space spectrum <lb/>feasibility to investigate the amount of spectrum available for white space use. In some European countries, <lb/>such as Denmark, France and Germany, white space spectrum in the UHF band is used for Programme <lb/>Making and Special Event (PMSE) applications. <lb/>A practical implementation of the use of white space is yet to be introduced on a widespread basis. <lb/>The first white space device approval took place in December 2011 in the United States (Agility Data <lb/>Radio – KTS Wireless), and the first commercial white space broadband network was launched in <lb/>Wilmington, North Carolina in January 2012. For the time being, however, these deployments remain <lb/>anecdotal and limited to single communities and take up of the service is very limited. 10 Moreover, it <lb/>should be noted that in the European Union the regulatory framework for radio equipment largely differs <lb/>from the rest of the world and involves ad-hoc measures. Despite the necessary precaution for ensuring <lb/>smooth functioning of existing services, white space spectrum initiatives provide for a flexible license-<lb/>exempt framework to increase spectrum efficiency, in contrast with license-based schemes suggested under <lb/>LSA/ASA. <lb/>Two-or three-tiered access <lb/>In the United States, the PCAST report recommended, when referring to shared use of Federal <lb/>spectrum, that a three-tier approach be chosen, as opposed to the two-tiered alternative put forward by the <lb/>proponents of ASA. Its reasoning stems from the principle that all non-interfering uses should be permitted <lb/>in order to maximise utilisation of spectrum bands where the Federal government is the primary user. <lb/>Ideally, the newly proposed framework for shared use of spectrum should try to accommodate a <lb/>variety of approaches, possible applications and business models. While mobile carriers have expressed <lb/>their preference for a licensed framework based on exclusivity, which enables them to provide quality of <lb/>service and certainty for their investment, these desirable characteristics could eventually be made <lb/>compatible with a wider variety of approaches. For example, spectrum resources (at a specific location, at a <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT <lb/>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/></note>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>particular time) that remain underutilised could be authorised for general authorised access, taking into <lb/>account the clearing costs should that band be licensed for exclusive use at a later stage. <lb/>In that respect, many note the overwhelming success of unlicensed spectrum applications. By way of <lb/>example, it is often argued that the inferior characteristics of the unlicensed 900 MHz spectrum band in <lb/>Europe in relation to the United States have imposed a severe burden on the European smart-grid industry. <lb/>Only 15% of European smart-grid transmitters are wireless (87% in the United States), and those that are <lb/>wireless use mobile communications, which may entail a higher cost. <lb/>Some of the proposals for spectrum sharing, such as the FCC&apos;s 3.5 GHz NPRM, suggest that <lb/>databases already developed for white spaces could provide a functional basis and evolve to accommodate <lb/>a two-or three-tiered spectrum sharing scheme, subject to the inclusion of a set of new parameters. <lb/>Whether these databases should be administered by a regulator/authority or by an authorised third-party <lb/>administration is a different discussion, but any foreseen implementation of spectrum sharing could <lb/>consider and test these implementation issues before they become operational. <lb/>Any proposed framework for spectrum sharing could be subject to extensive public consultation, <lb/>which identifies potential, interested parties. Mobile operators seem to have a strong preference for <lb/>exclusive licensing or priority access to government spectrum where no or little sharing with third-party <lb/>players takes place. Even though this approach has proven successful in recent years, approaches <lb/>encouraging the inclusion of third parties may be accommodated in current spectrum holdings. <lb/>Harmful interference and receiver regulation <lb/>One of the technical challenges arising from a new environment where sharing is the rule and not the <lb/>exception, is the issue of interference, in particular harmful interference. The complexity in a shared <lb/>environment is that harmful interference may need to be defined on an ad-hoc basis, namely for each band <lb/>and service provided over this band, being potentially complemented by some degree of receiver <lb/>regulation/specification in terms of interference. <lb/>It can be noted that increased needs for sharing and low interference levels may in themselves be <lb/>contradictory. In other words, interference levels could potentially increase if more sharing occurs. The <lb/>issue to discern in this environment is whether, and to what extent, increased levels of interference may not <lb/>disrupt operations of existing users, while potentially accommodating new ones. <lb/>The ITU-R&apos;s radio regulations have established three different types of interference, when referring to <lb/>international frequency co-ordination between administrations: i) &quot; permissible &quot; : which complies with <lb/>quantitative and sharing criteria established by the regulation, ii) &quot; accepted &quot; : interference at a higher level <lb/>than &quot; permissible &quot; , but which has been agreed upon between two or more administrations, and <lb/>iii) &quot; harmful &quot; : which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation services or of other safety services or <lb/>seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radiocommunication service. 11 <lb/>According to the PCAST report, much could be done to adapt the current regulatory approach to <lb/>increase the attention paid to the ability of receivers to operate under a certain degree of interference. The <lb/>argument made is that poor receivers or, more widely, lack of awareness of the conditions in which <lb/>receivers can operate, adds considerable uncertainty to potential shared use of spectrum. It is, therefore, <lb/>necessary to complement existing transmitter regulation with some degree of receiver regulation, which <lb/>would clearly state the technical parameters for receivers necessary to qualify/certify their operation within <lb/>an accepted interference environment. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>In the transition towards a spectrum management framework where significantly more sharing occurs, <lb/>it may no longer make sense for regulation to solely focus on transmission. It is becoming increasingly <lb/>important to consider receiver performance in addition to radio transmitters and may also be necessary to <lb/>consider incentives to promote more resilient and efficient radio devices. It would avoid the need to <lb/>mandate that receivers be built, sold, or operated with specific performance characteristics; and it could <lb/>incentivise incumbent spectrum users to improve receivers to more efficiently use spectrum. As more <lb/>spectrum is made available for mobile broadband services, it is becoming more important that all wireless <lb/>licensees and users understand the radio frequency environment and that entrants understand interference <lb/>rights and responsibilities before engaging in significant investments. <lb/>Management opportunities and choices <lb/>Spectrum sharing, under unlicensed or light-license schemes, is a clear opportunity to increase the <lb/>efficiency in its use, by making underutilised spectrum resources available to other uses. This new <lb/>approach, however, has to be backed by sound technical examination in areas such as interference <lb/>mitigation assessments and through feasibility studies. <lb/>Given the relatively limited experience in spectrum sharing arrangements, broad consultation is <lb/>needed to identify potentially interested stakeholders and general awareness of the possibilities spectrum <lb/>sharing enables. In particular, spectrum inventories and databases could help identify sharing opportunities, <lb/>by providing information about spectrum utilisation. Given the potential for harmful interference and the <lb/>impact of possible disruption of current systems, in-depth studies for certain bands remain indispensable, <lb/>for a clear light-licensing/authorisation framework to be established. In particular, the maintenance and <lb/>operations of spectrum sharing databases appear to be crucial for these beneficial sharing opportunities to <lb/>be taken to fruition. <lb/>Policy makers need to address a number of areas, and reassess them in view of the new situation and <lb/>the general trend towards increased sharing. A clear candidate for this reassessment is receiver regulation, <lb/>whereby governments may need to establish requirements for certain bands to increase legal certainty for <lb/>potential spectrum sharing schemes. <lb/>INCENTIVE AUCTIONS <lb/>This report examines a number of approaches to increase the availability and use of spectrum in more <lb/>efficient ways. This is critical if greater use is to be made of wireless broadband services and the benefits <lb/>that they can bring for economic and social development. Over the past two decades, policy makers have <lb/>made greater use of the market for spectrum allocation through tools such as auctions. Further market-<lb/>based mechanisms, such as spectrum trading, have also played an important role in some countries. Given <lb/>the growing demand for spectrum and its finite nature the greater use of tools such as trading may help <lb/>better align supply and demand. The best-known example of increasing the availability of spectrum is the <lb/>possibility to transition some spectrum allocated to broadcasting to alternative uses that are more valued by <lb/>the market, notably wireless broadband services. Voluntary market-based tools have a number of <lb/>significant advantages as they can avoid some of the major challenges related to changing spectrum use: <lb/>the issue of migrating existing users, legal certainty for incumbent spectrum holders and the legal <lb/>instrument used to encourage or mandate that spectrum holders relinquish such resources. <lb/>In 2010, the United States National Broadband Plan introduced the idea of conducting incentive <lb/>auctions, as a tool to help meet that country&apos;s spectrum requirements. The FCC, acting on this plan, has <lb/>proposed to conduct such auctions. The underlying mechanism is that spectrum holders (typically <lb/>broadcasters) voluntarily agree to relinquish spectrum resources at a given price. Simultaneously, potential <lb/>bidders, e.g. communication operators, propose a certain price for these resources. The process of running <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>any auction for spectrum can be relatively complex and an incentive auction is no exception. The process <lb/>observes a two-sided nature of buyer and seller but is perhaps most distinguishable, from a traditional <lb/>auction of spectrum, in that the FCC is not the &quot; seller &quot; but rather acts to facilitate the process as might an <lb/>auctioneer and perform related notary tasks. The related tasks include reallocating the licenses of <lb/>broadcasters that have relinquished bands or repacking spectrum resources to build lots that make <lb/>economic sense. Incentive auctions of spectrum constitute a relatively novel approach in the global arena <lb/>and still need to be tested and undertaken but, if successfully implemented, could certainly provide a useful <lb/>new tool for reallocating spectrum for mobile communication services. <lb/>Spectrum auction theory and incentive auctions <lb/>Nowadays, auctioning spectrum is a common practice in OECD countries. Commencing in the early <lb/>1990s, in New Zealand and the United States, more and more countries have chosen auctions to assign <lb/>spectrum for communication services. Over time the design of auctions has been improved and sometimes <lb/>made more complex in relation to meeting perceived challenges (e.g. potential collusion) or obtaining <lb/>desired outcomes, e.g. increased competition (Porter and Smith, 2006). One such innovation has been, for <lb/>example, the transition from auctioning single or small groups of licenses to grouping them in order to <lb/>maximise the visibility for participants, so that they could adjust their bids accordingly. Nonetheless, the <lb/>most beneficial advantages of auctions have been their transparency, for all stakeholders, in arriving at <lb/>explainable outcomes and using the market&apos;s knowledge to arrive at a better appreciation of the value of <lb/>spectrum. <lb/>In recent years, some countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, <lb/>Switzerland and the United Kingdom have followed the combinatorial clock auction approach. The format <lb/>allows bidders to express their willingness to pay across the range of packages of the lots that are of <lb/>interest to them and it treats bids for packages of lots as inseparable (i.e. a bidder cannot win only a sub-<lb/>part of a package it bids on, it either wins a package in its entirety or not at all). This is a type of ascending <lb/>auction and can include an open phase of bidding to help price and outcome discovery and a <lb/>supplementary single round of bidding to complement the bids of the open phase, with specific rules that <lb/>promote bidding in accordance with true preferences. Like all market mechanisms, it requires careful <lb/>design, tailored to the circumstances, and it allows for the resolution of a range of issues in the auction. For <lb/>example, a combinatorial clock auction does not require pre-defined licences with specified amounts of <lb/>spectrum for each licence and one licence per winner. The format can also determine the band plan for the <lb/>spectrum on offer, if there is uncertainty as to how much spectrum should go to two or more competing <lb/>types of uses (e.g. terrestrial mobile vs. satellite use). The format also lends itself to using generic lots, <lb/>i.e. lots that are in a category of similar blocks of spectrum, but not tied to specific frequencies. With <lb/>generic lots, the auction first deals with the key question of who wins how much spectrum in the different <lb/>category, and moves in a subsequent phase to the secondary question of what exact frequencies the winners <lb/>will receive. <lb/>As noted above, in the case of incentive auctions, combining the sale and purchase of spectrum in the <lb/>same market process raises challenges of complexity for the auctioneer and participants. As a result, some <lb/>have proposed that using generic lots for an incentive auction could help in managing complexity. For <lb/>example, for its upcoming incentive auction of 600 MHz spectrum, the FCC has proposed auctioning <lb/>generic blocks to avoid the complexity, delay, and computational burden that bidding on specific licenses <lb/>would create. Ofcom, the regulator in the United Kingdom, in its call for inputs on future use of the <lb/>700 MHz band has considered whether an incentive auction could allow market participants to determine <lb/>whether release of a band may happen earlier than a backstop date, with sellers setting out minimum <lb/>payments they would need to receive in order to vacate the band earlier while new users express their <lb/>willingness to pay for earlier access. 12 This approach, while including a fixed deadline for the <lb/>implementation of changes (and, in this case, also fixing the amount of spectrum to be released), offers <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT <lb/></note>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>scope for market optimisation of the release date, although Ofcom recognises that there is a question as to <lb/>whether an appropriate incentive auction can be designed in the context of future use of the 700 MHz band. <lb/>There may be forms of incentive auctions which could avoid having to define a band plan prior to the <lb/>auction itself (though incentive auctions do not rule out having pre-defined band plans). If so, this could <lb/>allow regulators to avoid the complex process of defining a band plan, and allow more flexibility. However, <lb/>in some cases there are benefits to an internationally-harmonised band plan, which would be foregone if <lb/>band plans were dependent on the outcomes of national incentive auctions. <lb/>Moreover, spectrum auctions play a key role in shaping wireless markets, and therefore deserve a <lb/>careful examination from competition authorities. In fact, spectrum is a key asset for wireless competition. <lb/>Today, it is common to see a fair amount of attention from regulators to spectrum holdings from operators <lb/>that request to merge and to undertake spectrum transactions in secondary markets. This is the case even <lb/>though secondary markets are generally not yet well developed in most OECD countries. A common <lb/>measure in spectrum auctions is the imposition of spectrum caps, which limit the maximum amount of <lb/>spectrum that the largest players may bid for (input restrictions). In its 4G auction of 2013, the United <lb/>Kingdom also used outcome restrictions, or spectrum floors, to ensure that, subject to demand in the <lb/>auction, its outcome would be consistent with competition policy objectives for the mobile sector. Another <lb/>possibility is to impose a bidding cap for a specific auction, in that players are not allowed to bid for more <lb/>than a given amount of spectrum in that auction, regardless of other criteria such as their size or their <lb/>current spectrum holdings. <lb/>Box 3. FCC&apos;s incentive auctions <lb/>Background: <lb/>In its 2010 National Broadband Plan, the Federal Communications Commission ( &quot; FCC &quot; ) proposed incentive <lb/>auctions as one means to facilitate economically beneficial reallocation of spectrum. The plan describes an incentive <lb/>auction as a voluntary, market-based means of repurposing spectrum by encouraging existing broadcast television <lb/>licensees to voluntarily relinquish spectrum usage rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds from an auction of <lb/>new licenses to use the repurposed spectrum. This process brings market forces to bear on many of the most <lb/>important decisions about spectrum reallocation, e.g., how much spectrum and in what markets should spectrum be <lb/>reallocated. <lb/>In early 2012, the United States Congress authorised the FCC to conduct incentive auctions, with the first <lb/>auction to be of broadcast television spectrum. Congress further directed that certain net proceeds from the broadcast <lb/>incentive auction are to be deposited in a Public Safety Trust Fund to fund a national first responder network, state <lb/>and local public safety grants, and public safety research, and the balance is to be used for deficit reduction. In <lb/>October 2012, the FCC launched a rulemaking proceeding to hold the world&apos;s first incentive auction. <lb/>The propagation characteristics of spectrum in the UHF bands (e.g., further reach and better penetration <lb/>through buildings than higher frequencies and, therefore, the need for fewer transmitters to cover the same area), <lb/>which are allocated to broadcast television, also make spectrum in these bands especially well-suited for mobile <lb/>broadband uses. The particular suitability of UHF spectrum for mobile broadband is why the incentive auction <lb/>process holds such promise. Through the incentive auction, a portion of the spectrum currently occupied by broadcast <lb/>television licensees will be made available for mobile broadband. The FCC will use its unique authority to replace the <lb/>broadcast licenses that it reclaims in the reverse auction with flexible use licenses for the cleared spectrum that may <lb/>cover large geographic areas that were previously occupied by numerous individual stations (see figure below with <lb/>broadcast television spectrum in the United States). Without the FCC&apos;s authority and co-ordination, the creation of <lb/>such licenses suitable for deploying mobile broadband service nationwide would be impossible. <lb/>…/… <lb/></body>

			<body>Source: FCC. <lb/>Auction Design: <lb/>The incentive auction itself will actually be comprised of two separate but interdependent auctions: i) a <lb/>reverse auction, which will determine the price at which broadcasters will voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage <lb/>rights; and ii) a forward auction, which will determine the price that companies are willing to pay for flexible use of <lb/>wireless licenses. The lynchpin joining the reverse and the forward auctions is the &quot; repacking &quot; process. Repacking <lb/>involves reorganising and assigning channels to the remaining broadcast television stations in order to create <lb/>contiguous blocks of cleared spectrum suitable for flexible use. However, the FCC must take great care in the <lb/>repacking process because the United States Congress requires the FCC to make all reasonable efforts to preserve the <lb/> &quot; coverage area &quot; and &quot; population served &quot; of the television stations involved. <lb/>In order to be successful, each of the components must work together. Ultimately, the reverse auction <lb/>requires information about how much bidders are willing to pay for spectrum licenses in the forward auction; and the <lb/>forward auction requires information regarding what spectrum rights were tendered in the reverse auction, and at <lb/>what price; and each of these depend on efficiently repacking the remaining broadcasters. The actual implementation, <lb/>while it will be thoroughly explained and illustrated in technical documents and rules, is designed to place the <lb/>complex elements &quot; under the hood, &quot; with an aim to make participation as straight-forward and easy as possible from <lb/>the bidder&apos;s perspective. <lb/>In the reverse auction, broadcasters would have at least four options: i) do not participate in the auction and <lb/>stay on the air on the same or another channel in the same band, as determined in the repacking process; ii) participate <lb/>and bid to give up all rights to their channel and go off the air; iii) participate and bid to give up all rights to their <lb/>channel but share a channel with another broadcaster after the auction; or iv) participate and bid to give up all rights <lb/>to their channel but move from UHF to VHF and remain on the air. All options are designed to help make the <lb/>auction accessible to the widest possible range of broadcaster participants. <lb/>The forward auction piece of the incentive auction will differ from the typical spectrum auction because, <lb/>unlike typical spectrum auctions, the number and locations of licenses available in the forward auction will depend <lb/>upon the results of the reverse auction. The FCC is considering innovative new approaches to auction design to <lb/>manage this interrelationship and integrate the different auction components. <lb/>Furthermore, unlike other band plans, the final structure of the 600 MHz band plan will depend on the results <lb/>of the reverse auction. Therefore, rather than a fixed, predetermined band plan, the FCC proposes to adopt a band <lb/>plan that accommodates varying amounts of available wireless spectrum. The FCC is also considering using bidding <lb/>for &quot; generic &quot; spectrum blocks, which can then be translated into specific licenses at the end of the auction. This <lb/>practice, common in European spectrum auctions, would be expected to speed up the forward auction, reducing the <lb/>cost of bidder participation. <lb/>Conclusion: <lb/>The incentive auction will present a significant financial opportunity for broadcasters who wish to relinquish <lb/>spectrum rights, while also allowing other broadcasters to remain on the air and continue providing the public with <lb/>local, free over-the-air television service. At the same time, the spectrum reclaimed through the auction will promote <lb/>economic growth; increase the speed, capacity and ubiquity of mobile broadband service; and accelerate the <lb/>smartphone and tablet-led mobile revolution, benefitting consumers and businesses throughout the country. The FCC <lb/>intends to conduct the broadcast incentive auction in 2014. <lb/></body>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>The repacking process <lb/>The repacking process in an incentive auction, together with the rules for broadcasters to release <lb/>spectrum, forms the basis for the future band segmentation plan and determines the amount of spectrum <lb/>that will be freed in the process. The proposed auction design contains a number of features, such as <lb/>generic bidding and simultaneous ascending bidding, which address some of the challenges identified by <lb/>the FCC in previous auctions. At first glance however, it is the repacking process that seems, at the same <lb/>time, more innovative and challenging. As the firms assisting with the incentive auction process have noted <lb/>in their discussion documents filed to the FCC proceedings, the final amount of spectrum that will be freed <lb/>depends not only on the willingness of broadcasters to relinquish their spectrum rights, but also on how the <lb/>remaining channels will be rearranged. <lb/>Repacking involves the complex engineering and auction design challenge of assigning channels to <lb/>the broadcast television stations that remain on the air after the incentive auction in order to clear <lb/>contiguous blocks of spectrum suitable for flexible use. How the FCC conducts the repacking will have a <lb/>significant impact on its ability to repurpose spectrum in the incentive auction (Milgrom et al., 2012). <lb/>In considering which channels can be assigned to which television stations, the FCC recognises that <lb/>television stations can cause harmful interference to each other if they are assigned to the same or adjacent <lb/>television channels. The legislation authorising the incentive auction requires that in repacking, the FCC <lb/> &quot; make all reasonable efforts to preserve […] the coverage area and population served of each broadcast <lb/>television licensee […] &quot; (FCC, 2012b). The FCC is developing methodologies and implementing software <lb/>to integrate the repacking function into the auction design such that real-time evaluations of technical <lb/>feasibility for assigning channels to broadcasters can be made in a manner that meets the statutory <lb/>requirements. <lb/>Alternative instruments to release broadcasting spectrum <lb/>Undoubtedly, the main strengths of incentive auctions are that they are voluntary and market-based. <lb/>Once policy makers agree that more spectrum resources need to be freed up and dedicated to mobile <lb/>broadband use, they need to make a decision about the right procedure to fulfil this objective. At the same <lb/>time they need to bear in mind the existing constraints, such as the impact on current services, the <lb/>migration timeframe, expected costs and so forth. They can consider alternatives such as spectrum sharing, <lb/>increasing incentives for secondary markets or mandating the release of broadcasting spectrum but <lb/>recognise that they may involve a less consensual approach. <lb/>Promoting spectrum trading in secondary markets may constitute a reasonable alternative to incentive <lb/>auctions. Some have noted the existing barriers to spectrum trading, such as the conditions imposed on <lb/>spectrum licensees, lengthy transaction delays or the lack of information about possible spectrum <lb/>transaction (Mayo and Wallsten, 2011). Conducting auctions in a centralised manner is believed to have a <lb/>number of advantages over secondary trading, as having an authority conducting auctions removes the <lb/>challenge of multi-party co-ordination (Kwerel et al., 2012), especially with regard to the repacking <lb/>process, as spectrum could be freed by forming a meaningful group that can be optimised for mobile <lb/>broadband use. As noted above, a number of countries in the European Union still keep restrictions on <lb/>spectrum trading and, where it is permitted, it has not yet been widely used. Another factor that may play a <lb/>role is the overall shortage of spectrum resources for mobile operators, which may drive industry players to <lb/>acquire spectrum through mergers, as opposed to secondary markets, being subject to scrutiny from <lb/>competition authorities, under the assumption that most carriers would not be willing to sell their rights on <lb/>secondary markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>In light of these concerns, measures favouring spectrum trading, such as establishing clear and <lb/>detailed rules, with clearly defined rights and obligations, publishing available information about tradable <lb/>spectrum or minimising administrative overheads, may certainly help develop more efficient secondary <lb/>markets (OECD, 2005). Except for its potential effect on spectrum harmonisation, nothing prevents policy <lb/>makers from further promoting spectrum trading, so these measures could be regarded as a complement <lb/>rather than a substitute of other means of increasing spectrum efficiency. Regarding broadcasting spectrum, <lb/>there are currently regulatory barriers that prevent spectrum transfers for uses other than those reflected in <lb/>license conditions, as service neutrality is the exception rather than the rule. <lb/>Another, more straightforward approach is simply mandating the migration from broadcasting to <lb/>wireless communication uses, as has been done for the release of the digital dividend in many OECD <lb/>countries. While &quot; mandating &quot; is a fairly general term, open to many variations, to some extent it carries the <lb/>character of non-voluntariness, which would imply that broadcasters do not have the choice of staying in <lb/>their current channels. This &quot; compulsory &quot; approach would not necessarily mean that broadcasters are forced <lb/>to cease their activities as they are likely to have several alternatives to continue their business. Moving to <lb/>lower bands (e.g. VHF), switching to wired distribution of channels where fixed broadband networks are <lb/>available, accepting more interference or simply willing to share spectrum in a digital multiplex may be <lb/>among the available options. Moreover, improved coding and transmission techniques allow for lower <lb/>bandwidth and thus some channels would be freed only by technology upgrading. Of course, the pros and <lb/>cons of each of these alternatives would depend on the amount of spectrum to be released. <lb/>In many OECD countries, such as Spain, the clearance of the digital dividend band (the 800 MHz <lb/>band in that country) was conducted on a &quot; compulsory &quot; basis, but it did not result in any broadcaster being <lb/>unable to continue its service. Instead, new channels were introduced as a result of spectrum efficiency <lb/>gains arising from the transition to digital technology. This may be harder to achieve for lower <lb/>broadcasting bands, although the introduction of new technologies such as MPEG4, DVB-T2 or, in the <lb/>near future, HEVC in broadcasting may offer an opportunity to achieve further spectrum efficiency. <lb/>The pros and cons of a &quot; voluntary &quot; versus &quot; non-voluntary &quot; approach would need to be assessed for <lb/>each OECD country. That would include the possibility of mandating migration in view of factors such as <lb/>the duration of broadcasting licenses, the authority of spectrum regulators to relinquish these rights or the <lb/>overall spectrum band allocation in that country, especially with regard to the possibility of migrating <lb/>broadcasters to other spectrum bands. The availability of high-speed fixed lines alternatives will, of course, <lb/>be an important consideration when assessing the different possibilities. <lb/>Implementing incentive auctions raises a number of legal and practical issues, in particular whether <lb/>regulators have the necessary legal powers to undertake incentive auctions or whether pre-existing <lb/>conditions (e.g. existing rights to use spectrum) lend themselves to this sort of market mechanism. There <lb/>may also be issues resulting from the time elapsed between any incentive auction and the starting of new <lb/>licences. In short, the issue is whether countries other than the United States could undertake an incentive <lb/>auction and to what extent it would deliver satisfactory results. Several factors may play a role in that <lb/>respect, such as the spectrum harmonisation issues and the powers of regulators to undertake incentive <lb/>auctions. An intermediate approach is to let the market participants decide on the timing of the release of <lb/>the band, for which they would express their preferences. This approach, while keeping its &quot; compulsory <lb/>character &quot; would allow for a higher degree of flexibility (Ofcom, 2013). <lb/>A potential problem of using incentive auctions in the European Union as an authorisation and re-<lb/>allocation mechanism is that it may deliver different results in different countries (member states). <lb/>Incentive auctions in the European Union area could therefore, some suggest, lead to spectrum fragmenta-<lb/>tion and the subsequent loss of economies of scale for network deployment and device manufacturing, <lb/>compared to the current situation (i.e. national awards of internationally-harmonised bands). In practice, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT <lb/></note>

			<page>40 <lb/></page>

			<body>OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS <lb/>the scope for incentive auctions to lead to fragmentation will depend on what is to be determined in the <lb/>auction. For example, there is greater risk of fragmentation if the band plan is dependent on the auction <lb/>outcome. Another option would be to have incentive auctions which awarded spectrum across the <lb/>European Union. However, some countries of the European Union argue that harmonised rules at the <lb/>European level would have the risk of being too inflexible and that countries which wished to release <lb/>spectrum ahead of the international timetable would be held back from doing so, leading to a delay in <lb/>delivering benefits to manufacturers, operators and consumers in those countries. Late adopters, they argue, <lb/>would not be able to benefit from the lessons learned from the initial auctions. These challenges are, of <lb/>course, not exclusive to incentive auctions and are frequently raised as arguments against certain aspects of <lb/>spectrum harmonisation. <lb/>Having said that, one of the goals of the European Union&apos;s Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) <lb/>is the harmonisation of technical conditions for spectrum use at the regional (European) level. An <lb/>intermediate approach would be setting minimum thresholds for relinquishing spectrum rights or by <lb/>adopting additional measures in those countries where spectrum use by broadcasters is more intense, such <lb/>as subsidies for migrating broadcasters, which could facilitate European-wide harmonisation. <lb/>Finally, the FCC&apos;s incentive auction proceedings incorporate some provisions related to unlicensed <lb/>use of spectrum, such as keeping the possibility of using unlicensed devices in guard bands or allowing the <lb/>use of white space devices, even though the available spectrum for these applications may be reduced as a <lb/>result of higher concentration of broadcasters in the lower UHF bands after the auction. <lb/></body>
