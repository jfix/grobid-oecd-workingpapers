			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>There has been much debate in policy and scholarly circles investigating whether the quality of<lb/> institutions, in general, and the quality of government, in particular, affects the delivery and efficiency of public<lb/> investment. The growing agreement is that institutions and quality of government make an important difference<lb/> for the efficiency in the delivery of public policies and, consequently, for economic development (<ref type="biblio">Amin and<lb/> Thrift, 1995; Amin, 1999; Hall and Jones, 1999; Acemoglu et al, 2001; Rodrik et al, 2004</ref>). Places with weak<lb/> and/or inefficient institutions suffer from a variety of problems which can range from pervasive corruption, rent-<lb/>seeking, insider-outsider problems, clientelism and nepotism to principal agent or impacted information<lb/> problems (Rodríguez-<ref type="biblio">Pose and Storper, 2006</ref>). Different combinations of these problems lead to imperfectly<lb/> functioning markets and institutional and government failure, reducing, in turn, the capacity of governments to<lb/> adequately design and efficiently deliver public goods and policies.<lb/> The European Union (EU) has also adopted the view that poor institutions undermine the returns of public<lb/> investments. As stated in the EU &quot; s Fifth Cohesion Report, &quot; poor institutions can, in particular, hinder the<lb/> effectiveness of regional development strategies &quot; (EU, 2010: 65). The quality of local institutions is thus<lb/> considered to mediate the potential returns of investment in regional cohesion: the weaker the institutional<lb/> setting, the greater the problems in transforming European regional development investment into growth and<lb/> development. Regions with weak institutions have been considered as incapable of absorbing regional<lb/> development and cohesion funds and to make the most of the investments taking place in their territory. It<lb/> comes therefore is no surprise that, as early as 1997 in its draft Agenda 2000, the European Commission sought<lb/> to establish a ceiling of regional development expenditures, stating that in order &quot; to avoid major problems with<lb/> regard to absorption, the level of annual aid should increase gradually, subject to the general limit of 4% of<lb/> national GDP, which would apply to the structural funds and the cohesion fund together &quot; (EU, 1997, page 25).<lb/> Yet, despite the growing interest on institutional factors, the empirical literature on how the quality of<lb/> government impinges on the returns of European public policies and public investments at a regional level is<lb/> still in its infancy. While in development economics there has been a growing body of literature linking, for<lb/> example, the institutions associated to colonial origins and economic outcomes (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Acemoglu et al. 2001</ref>),<lb/> there is still relatively little evidence about whether and how the quality of government has shaped the efficient<lb/> implementation of public policies and the use of public investment at regional level. We know even less about<lb/> the mechanisms at play in the interaction between regional political institutions – beyond social capital<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Beugelsdijk and van Schaik, 2005a and 2005b</ref>) and culture (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Tabellini, 2010)</ref> – and economic development.<lb/> At the EU level there is to our knowledge no clear-cut evidence that the quality of government of the different<lb/> regions affects the returns of European cohesion support and no proof that poor quality of government limits the<lb/> absorptive capacity of European funds. There is also little evidence, beyond the work of <ref type="biblio">Becker et al. (2012)</ref>,<lb/> that the returns of European cohesion efforts decline as cohesion investment increases and none that they<lb/> diminish when regional transfers exceed a threshold of 4% of GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper we combine data on the investment undertaken by the EU in cohesion and structural policies<lb/> targeting regions, with data on the quality of government gathered by the Quality of Government Institute at the<lb/> University of Gothenburg. This allows us to assess whether different local combinations taking into account the<lb/> rule of law, the control of corruption, government effectiveness, and voice and accountability affect the returns<lb/> of European structural and cohesion fund investments across the regions of the EU during the period between<lb/> 1996 and 2007. In particular, we are interested in whether and how the quality of government in any given<lb/> European region mediates the returns of European investments and whether these effects are larger or smaller<lb/> beyond a given threshold of cohesion investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results indicate that, although at first sight the quality of government does not seem to affect the<lb/> returns of European investment across the whole sample of regions considered, it does play a major role in<lb/> determining whether the cohesion effort is connected to greater growth in those regions receiving the greatest<lb/> amount of funds. For those regions receiving on average more than 80 euros of cohesion expenditure per capita<lb/> per year, the quality of government is a basic determinant of whether greater cohesion investment is translated<lb/> into greater growth. The importance of the quality of government increases significantly as the level of cohesion<lb/> expenditure rises. In addition, our analysis using interaction terms, finds that for regions receiving a<lb/> considerable amount of funds and sharing a similar level of quality of government, greater expenditure does not<lb/> necessarily translate into greater economic growth, unless the quality of government is improved.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Institutions, quality of government and economic development<lb/></head>

			<p>Across all areas of the social sciences there is a growing scholarly consensus that institutions matter for<lb/> economic development. Economic sociologists (<ref type="biblio">Tönnies, 1887; Weber, 1921; Granovetter, 1973; Coleman,<lb/> 1988</ref>) have for now more than a century been stressing the importance of institutions for the effectiveness of<lb/> public policy and economic development. Different types of institutions not only create the rules of the game by<lb/> which economic activities are governed, but also de facto shape the incentives and disincentives driving<lb/> economic interactions, making them essential determinants for the economic outcomes in any given territory.<lb/> The baton laid by economic sociologists has been taken over in recent decades by a raft of other social<lb/> scientists. Geographers (<ref type="biblio">Amin and Thrift, 1994; Amin, 1999</ref>), political scientists (<ref type="biblio">Putnam, 1993, 2000</ref>) and<lb/> economists (<ref type="biblio">North, 1990; Acemoglu et al., 2001; Rodrik et al., 2004</ref>) have of late delved into how institutions<lb/> shape and determine economic development, indicating that long-term economic outcomes tend frequently to<lb/> be the result of institutional conditions more than of alternative economic factors (<ref type="biblio">Rodrik et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/> One essential form of political institution is that related to the quality of government. Government, in<lb/> general, and local and regional governments, in particular, are the key organisations determining the rules of the<lb/> game at the local level. The quality of local governments is therefore likely to affect the efficiency and the<lb/> returns of any type of public investment. Accountable and transparent governments, staffed by well-trained civil<lb/> servants and led by trustworthy politicians who have the interests of the local community at heart will, in all<lb/> likelihood, design and implement policies and public goods which benefit the whole community and result in<lb/> inclusive sustainable development. Unaccountable governments, poorly staffed and with inept and/or corrupt<lb/> politicians at the helm will, by contrast, deliver inefficient policies or, worse still, lead to situations where rent-<lb/>seeking and insider-outsider problems become the norm.<lb/></p>

			<p>The views that institutions matter and that the quality of local governments affects the effectiveness and<lb/> returns of public policies has been assimilated by the EU in the application of its regional cohesion policy. This<lb/> is important because, although all member states of the EU should have adopted the so-called, Acquis<lb/> Communautaire 1 or the accumulated legislation and court decisions of the EU, it is plainly evident that the<lb/> functioning of these formal institutions varies considerably from country to country and even within countries.<lb/> This is because, as underlined by <ref type="biblio">Vachudova (2009)</ref>, especially in the case of former transition countries which<lb/> have joined the EU since 2004, the requirements to improve the transparency and efficiency of state institutions<lb/> have been adopted, rather than enforced. This leads to still considerable differences across the EU in the quality<lb/> of formal institutions and, in particular, in those of informal institutions, with corruption and clientelism still<lb/> representing major obstacles for the full establishment of the rule of law in many areas of the former transition<lb/> countries of Central and Eastern Europe (<ref type="biblio">Guasti and Dobovsek, 2011</ref>). Hence, across parts of Europe we find<lb/> different combinations of corruption, pervasive rent-seeking, self-serving decision-makers, and low quality of<lb/> bureaucracy – all indicators of the presence of weak governmental institutions and a low quality of government<lb/> – which are likely to hurt the effectiveness of all types of public policies and, in the case of the EU cohesion<lb/> effort, may undermine the assimilation of funds and affect the potential returns of EU expenditure in structural<lb/> and cohesion funds. Furthermore, the quality of government at the local level is a key element in multilevel<lb/> forms of government for coordinating actions across tiers of government, aligning policy objectives, enhancing<lb/> the delivery of goods and services, and ensuring the local needs are represented and taken into account in the<lb/> policy design across the different layers.<lb/> From this perspective, the lower the quality of government, the lower the capacity to absorb development<lb/> funds, and the lower the efficiency and returns of public investments. This sort of reasoning is at the heart of the<lb/> 4% of GDP expenditure limit proposed in the Agenda 2000: if institutions and the quality of government of any<lb/> given European region are deficient, more expenditure on development would not lead to the expected results,<lb/> unless the institutional conditions which limit the effectiveness of expenditure are not improved.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Measuring the quality of government<lb/></head>

			<p>Linking government quality to the returns of public policies is difficult and there is little empirical<lb/> evidence so far that establishes such a nexus. Perhaps the main problem in this respect is that of defining and<lb/> measuring the quality of government. Government quality is an elusive concept. It may mean different things to<lb/> different people and it is likely to be affected by myriad of factors. Notwithstanding this, the number of studies<lb/> and indices which have looked at issues of quality of government and governance at national level has not<lb/> ceased to grow (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Kaufman et al., 2009</ref>). However, subnational regions, cities and localities remain – despite<lb/> the perception of wide internal variations in quality of government within countries – virtually uncharted<lb/> territories. Some studies have ventured more in depth into how the quality of governmental institutions affects<lb/> economic performance in different parts of the country. This type of analysis been very prevalent for the case of<lb/> Italy, where a large number of local Meridionalisti (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Trigilia, 1992; Diamanti et al., 1995; Bodo and Viesti,<lb/> 1997</ref>) and many foreign scholars (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Putnam, 1993</ref>) have delved for the roots of the differences in<lb/> development between the North and the South of the country, among other factors, in the variation in the<lb/> efficiency of local governments between diverse parts of Italy. But analyses covering subnational entities<lb/> beyond the borders of the nation-states are conspicuously absent.<lb/> This lack of comparable data on the quality of government across national borders for Europe has recently<lb/> been addressed by a report by the Quality of Government Institute of the University of Gothenburg (Quality of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Government Institute, 2010</ref>). This study resorts to survey data from 34,000 respondents, living in 172 NUTS1<lb/> and NUTS2 regions (NUTS2 is largely equivalent to the OECD &quot; s Territorial Level 2) 2 in 18 EU states 3 in order<lb/> to measure the perception of the quality of regional and local governments across Europe. In the report,<lb/> following Rothstein and <ref type="biblio">Teorell (2008)</ref>, the quality of government is assimilated to the concept of impartial<lb/> government institutions, that is &quot; when public officials who implement policies do not take anything about the<lb/> citizen/case into consideration that is not beforehand stipulated in the policy or the law &quot; (Quality of Government<lb/> Institute, 2010, page 9). In order to operationalise this concept, the Quality of Government Institute resorts to<lb/> decomposing the idea of quality of government into four components: a) rule of law; b) corruption; c) quality of<lb/> the bureaucracy or bureaucratic effectiveness; and d) democracy and the strength of electoral institutions<lb/> (Quality of Government Institute, 2010, page 21).<lb/> Thirty-four questions regarding all these four components were included in a survey which – after the<lb/> thematic and geographical aggregation of the different answers by the 34,000 respondents – resulted in the<lb/> formation of a regional-level quality of government index and to the first mapping of regional government<lb/> quality across regions of the EU in the year 2009 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Regional quality of government index, 2009<lb/></figure>

			<p>Figure 1 reveals the presence of a West/East and, to a much lesser extent, North/South divide in the<lb/> subnational quality of government in Europe. Regions in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands rank<lb/> among those with the best quality of government in Europe, as do Scotland and the East Midlands in the<lb/> UK. Among the regions in the South, Trentino-Alto Adige and Valle d &quot; Aosta are also amongst the best<lb/> performers. Some Spanish regions, such as Asturias, the Basque Country, Extremadura or Galicia also<lb/> score highly in the index, as is the case of Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Italy. The worst scores are found in the<lb/> South East of Europe. Bulgarian, Greek and Slovakian regions have, according to the results of the survey,<lb/> the worst quality of government. Some southern Italian regions, such as Calabria and Campania, are also<lb/> perceived to be in the same category.<lb/> Internal contrasts are visible in a number of countries. This is more evident in countries with an<lb/> overall low subnational quality of government (Slovakia being the main exception). Italy represents the<lb/> most extreme case. While some northern regions have levels of quality of government matching those of<lb/> Scandinavian countries or the Netherlands, there is very little difference in the perception of the quality of<lb/> government between regions in the South of the country and those of Bulgaria or Romania. In Romania<lb/> some regions in the west of the country – Nord Vest and Centru – perform relatively well, whereas the<lb/> quality of government for Bucharest is regarded to be well below the national mean. Strong internal<lb/> variation can also be observed in Belgium, Bulgaria, Portugal, or Spain.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data provided by the Quality of Government Institute are only available for a single year (2009).<lb/> Following <ref type="biblio">Charron et al. (2012)</ref>, we interpolate values across a longer time period by combining the data<lb/> with the World Bank &quot; s World Governance Indicators, available at the national level. The assumption is that<lb/> regional variations within countries are relatively stable; and variations at the national level are captured by<lb/> the World Bank World Indicators. Details on how this indicator is calculated can be found in <ref type="biblio">Charron et al.<lb/> (2012)</ref>. The combined interpolated data for 2009 is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. It displays a picture of quality of<lb/> government in Europe which is strongly associated to the levels of socio-economic development and social<lb/> trust of the regions of the EU, but uncorrelated to other factors, such as population and area size (<ref type="biblio">Charron<lb/> et al., 2012</ref>). The strong West/East divide in quality of government of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> is maintained, but the<lb/> North/South divide becomes even more pronounced (<ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>). The introduction of the World Bank Global<lb/> Governance indicators in the resulting regional index drags down the scores for the quality of government<lb/> fundamentally in Romanian, Italian and Spanish regions, while the highest scores remain concentrated in<lb/> Scandinavia, West and North Netherlands, Scotland, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia, and Burgenland.<lb/> Slovakian regions, by contrast, no longer rank amongst those with the lowest quality of government in<lb/> Europe.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Model and data<lb/></head>

			<p>Given that &quot; good governance is a necessary requirement for countries to foster economic<lb/> development &quot; (Quality of <ref type="biblio">Government Institute, 2010, page 19</ref>) and government quality determines the<lb/> capacity to transform investment into economic activity and development, this implies that the quality of<lb/> government mediates the returns of public policy.<lb/> Our analysis explores whether this is the case in Europe: do the economic returns of structural funds<lb/> and cohesion investment in Europe depend on the quality of government of the regions where the<lb/> investment takes place? Our aim is to assess the extent to which the quality of local or regional<lb/> governments might mitigate or enhance the effects of structural and cohesion fund investment on regional<lb/> economic performance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Model specification<lb/></head>

			<p>Our econometric model uses panel data and aims to assess the returns of European investment in<lb/> economic and social cohesion at a regional level and, more specifically, to determine whether these returns<lb/> are affected by the quality of the government of the regions receiving funds, while controlling for a series<lb/> of regional factors deemed to affect economic performance. In this interactive model, the growth of GDP<lb/> per capita across regions in Europe between 1996 and 2007 is specified by the following equation:<lb/></p>

				<formula>i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> QGov<lb/> Cohesion<lb/> QGov<lb/> Cohesion<lb/> y<lb/> y<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> φX<lb/> *<lb/> (1)<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where:<lb/> Δy is the average annual growth of real GDP per capita of region i over the period 1996-2005;<lb/> y i is the GDP per capita in the previous period in region i;<lb/> Cohesion is our main independent variable of interest and represents the per capita investments<lb/> undertaken by the European Union in region i under the structural and cohesion policy<lb/> framework;<lb/> QGov is our moderator, proxied by the composite indicator of the quality of government in any<lb/> given European region collected by the Quality of Government Institute at the University of<lb/> Gothenburg;<lb/></p>

			<p>Cohesion*QGov is the interaction term between the previous two variables;<lb/> X denotes a vector of variables controlling for other factors assumed to influence growth,<lb/> including the level of education and training of the adult population of the region, measures of<lb/> infrastructure endowment, levels of employment, and agglomeration effects and finally<lb/> υ is the corresponding disturbance term.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our main interest lies in the coefficients δ, ϕ, and γ, which intend to capture the connection between<lb/> the level of investments of the EU on regional cohesion, the quality of regional and local governments, and<lb/> the interaction of both terms, respectively, with economic growth.<lb/> By expanding model (1), we obtain the following specification, which is used as our empirical model:<lb/></p>

				<formula><lb/>  <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> t<lb/> j<lb/> j<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> e<lb/> u<lb/> T<lb/> C<lb/></formula>

			<head>Data<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned previously, our dependent variable represents the average annual growth of real GDP<lb/> per capita of region i over the period 1996-2007. The main independent variable of interest is structural<lb/> fund and cohesion investments undertaken by the European Union targeting NUTS2 regions. Quality of<lb/> government is our moderating variable and we control for the interaction between cohesion investments<lb/> and quality of government.<lb/></p>

			<p>The public investments financed by the European Union (CohesionExp) are measured over the period<lb/> between 1996 and 2007, and represent the actual payments – rather than the commitments, as in a number<lb/> of prior studies on the impact of structural and cohesion funds – to European regions. Unfortunately, these<lb/> data do not cover public investments financed by regions and by national governments. Such data exist<lb/> only for a very limited number of countries. The variable thus represents a fraction of all public<lb/> investment, and a highly variable fraction at that, as there are large differences in the degree to which<lb/> regions draw on EU financing. These differences are explicitly addressed in some of the models below.<lb/> The quality of institutions is proxied by the use of a quality of government (QualGov) composite<lb/> index. As indicated earlier, this index is constructed for 172 European regions by the Quality of<lb/> Government Institute at the University of Gothenburg (see QGI, 2010, for full details of its construction).<lb/> The measure is a composite indicator of government quality based on survey data of public perceptions of<lb/> four components of governance. These components include (1) the rule of law, (2) corruption (3) the<lb/> quality of the bureaucracy and (4) democracy and the strength of electoral institutions. The main problem<lb/> with this indicator is that it was collected in 2009/2010 and only for that year. This implies that there are no<lb/> time series of quality of government data at the regional level, making it problematic to introduce this<lb/> indicator in a panel data analysis. We are therefore left with an option which includes a rather strong<lb/> assumption.<lb/></p>

			<p>The option used in order to circumvent the problem of lack of time series in quality of government<lb/> data across European regions is to assume that the quality of government detected in every region in 2009<lb/> has evolved in a similar way as changes in governance at the national level over time. We therefore follow<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Charron et al. (2012)</ref> and interpolate the quality of government composite index with a national<lb/> governance variable extracted from the World Bank Governance Data. The components included in the<lb/> World Bank national governance indicators encompass (1) rule of law (2) governance effectiveness (3)<lb/> control of corruption (4) voice and accountability. Mixing both indices gives us a regional indicator of<lb/> quality of government which varies for the whole period of analysis. This means that we are using the<lb/> Quality of Government Institute &quot; s (2010) combined with the quality of government index (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) as<lb/> an independent variable, rather than the regional quality of government index (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> Our third key independent variable of interest is the interaction term for public investment and the<lb/> quality of government (CohesionExp*QualGov). The introduction of this interaction represents an effort to<lb/> discern to what extent, if any, the impact of public investments depends on quality of government.<lb/> In addition, a number of control variables which, according to the theoretical and empirical literature,<lb/> may affect regional economic performance in Europe are also included in the analysis. Data for the control<lb/> variables are taken from the OECD Regional Database. The key control variables are:<lb/> InfrasDen: Infrastructure density defined by motorway kilometres by population;<lb/> Education: The percentage of adults having either only completed primary school (Primary<lb/> Education) or with a university degree (Tertiary Education) represent our proxies of the level of<lb/> human capital of the workforce.<lb/></p>

			<head>Emp Rate:</head>

			<p>The rate of employment in the region;<lb/> Density: Employment density (Emp Density) and population density (Pop Density) capture<lb/> agglomeration effects and are measured as employment per square kilometres and population per<lb/> square kilometres, respectively<lb/> GDP t-1 is the previous level of GDP per capita.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our model specification considers a two-way fixed effect panel regression model, with<lb/> heteroskedasticity robust estimators and country (C) and time (T) controls. Our sample of regions totals<lb/> 169 (three regions had to be dropped from the analysis) in 18 different countries in the European Union.<lb/> Most data are gathered – following the territorial division used in order to compile the Quality of<lb/> Government indicator – at NUTS2 level, with the exception of data for Belgium, Germany, Greece, the<lb/> Netherlands and the UK, which refers to NUTS1 regions. The time period covered in the analysis is limited<lb/> to the years between 1996 and 2007, due to the lack of availability World Bank Global Governance<lb/> Indicators before 1996.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Results of the analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned earlier, the analysis is conducted – in order to take advantage of the panel dimension of<lb/> the data – following the assumption that the quality of government in every EU region has evolved in a<lb/> similar way to changes in the quality of governance at the national level. By interpolating the quality of<lb/> government regional index with a national governance variable extracted from the World Bank<lb/> Governance Data, we achieve a continuous variable of quality of government (QualGov) which can be<lb/> used both as a moderator of the returns of cohesion investment and main effect, and as one of the two<lb/> components of the interaction.<lb/> Using these variables, we are capable of examining the link between investments in EU cohesion<lb/> policy (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, model 1) and quality of government (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, model 2), on the one hand, and economic<lb/> growth, on the other, separately; of both factors together (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, model 3); and of both main components<lb/> with their interaction (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, model 4)<lb/></p>

			<p>The empirical model is estimated first including all regions considered in the analysis, regardless of<lb/> the level of expenditure in each of the regions by the EU (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). This analysis provides evidence that<lb/> EU-financed public investment has had a positive and statistically significant link with regional growth,<lb/> regardless of the quality of local and regional government. The coefficient of the average expenditure per<lb/> head per region in cohesion funds is always positive and significant, whereas that referring to the quality of<lb/> government remains statistically insignificant (with the exception of model 3), despite having a positive<lb/> sign. The interaction between cohesion investments by the EU and the quality of government is also<lb/> insignificant, pointing to the possibility that the investment efforts by the EU may work regardless of the<lb/> quality of the government of the region where the expenditure takes place.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Table 1. Impact of public investment and quality of government on regional growth, no threshold<lb/> Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses: *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The relationship between the control variables and regional economic growth are generally as<lb/> expected. The presence of low skilled workers – proxied by the percentage of the adult population with<lb/> low levels of educational attainment – influences growth negatively and infrastructure endowment has a<lb/> positive impact. The stock of the total population with university education, employment rates, and<lb/> employment density are insignificant across all specifications of the model. Population density is only<lb/> positive and significant in regression 3.<lb/> However, the results presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> may be somewhat misleading, as the sample includes all<lb/> regions in the EU and is not particularly focused on those regions which receive the bulk of the cohesion<lb/> effort. Hence, the presence of a large number of regions that are relatively well-off, where EU intervention<lb/> in order to achieve greater cohesion is very limited, and where the overwhelming majority of public<lb/> expenditure is bound to come from local, regional and national sources, rather than from the EU, may bias<lb/> the results. EU structural fund and cohesion intervention in most of these regions would be insufficient to<lb/> make any real difference in economic performance.<lb/></p>

			<p>As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, EU-financed public investment varies widely across regions and this<lb/> variation is decidedly non-linear.

These regions include the so-called &quot; convergence &quot; regions –<lb/> formerly known as &quot; Objective 1 &quot; regions – which, by definition, are considerably poorer and, in general,<lb/> also tend to have greater government quality problems. These regions are, moreover, concentrated in<lb/> specific parts of Europe – mainly in central and eastern and southern Europe – which, as we saw in Figures<lb/> 1 and 2, are precisely those with the lowest levels of quality of government.

			<p>Given the very unequal distribution of cohesion funds across the regions of the EU, we assume that<lb/> quality of government may only make a real difference in the impact of European cohesion expenditure in<lb/> those regions which received a considerable amount of funding per head per year. We therefore divide the<lb/> sample following a series of thresholds according to the amount of money received by each region in any<lb/> given year. These thresholds are established at 80, 100, 120 and 150 euros of regional expenditure per<lb/> capita, allowing us to discriminate between the effects of public investment and quality of government on<lb/> regional performance on regions benefiting from different levels of public intervention. We take the<lb/> threshold of a minimum of 100 euros of structural and cohesion fund expenditure per capita as our<lb/> benchmark model for those regions receiving the bulk of the funds (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) and look at whether the<lb/> results of the interaction between structural fund expenditure and the quality of government change as the<lb/> level of transfers per head increases (</p>

			<p>The application of the different thresholds corroborates the results of the regressions for the more than<lb/> 100 euros threshold reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>:<lb/></p>

			<p> Above an expenditure threshold of 80 euros per head per annum, the coefficient for the cohesion<lb/> expenditure variable is always very close to 0 and keeps on losing significance as the threshold<lb/> increases.<lb/></p>

			<p> For those regions receiving more than 150 euros per person additional investments in structural<lb/> and cohesion funds becomes totally dissociated from greater economic growth (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, model<lb/> 5).<lb/> Hence, the positive and significant association between this variable and economic growth reported in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (and also in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, model 1) gradually evaporates, leading to a much stronger and significant<lb/> connection between government quality and regional economic performance. Indeed, at relatively high<lb/> levels of cohesion expenditure per capita, the quality of local or regional government always dominates the<lb/> level of expenditure per head as the key predictor of the returns of cohesion investment. Beyond 80 euros<lb/> of expenditure in regional development per capita per annum, the coefficient for quality of government is<lb/> always highly positive and significant. And this relationship becomes progressively reinforced as the<lb/> threshold of expenditure is increased (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, models 2 to 5). The association between quality of<lb/> government and regional economic performance is considerably stronger when the threshold of<lb/> expenditure is above 120 euros per head per annum in any given region than when the threshold is limited<lb/> to 80 euros. It is strongest for those regions receiving more than 150 euros per inhabitant per year.<lb/> The introduction of the interaction between public investment and quality of government (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>)<lb/> further reinforces the importance of the quality of government variable in determining the returns of<lb/> cohesion expenditure. As seen in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and reproduced in all regressions for <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> – with the exception<lb/> of when the no expenditure threshold is applied (model 1) – the introduction of the interaction term not<lb/> only reinforces the positive and significant coefficients associated to the quality of government variable,<lb/> but also renders the cohesion investment variable positive and significant, with the only exception of the<lb/> regression where the threshold is set at 150 euros.<lb/> However and against expectations, the coefficient of the interaction term between cohesion<lb/> investment and quality of government above the 80 euro per head investment threshold is always negative<lb/> and significant, and very close to 0 (Tables 4, models 2 to 5).<lb/> In order to correctly interpret the interaction between regional government quality and EU<lb/> investments in cohesion and structural policies, we plot in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> the two-way interaction effects for the<lb/> unstandardized variables using the procedures of <ref type="biblio">Aiken and West (1991</ref>) and Dawson and Richter (2006). 4<lb/> 4.<lb/> The webpage www.jeremydawson.co.uk/slopes.htm contains various Excel worksheets which help interpret<lb/> the interaction effects.<lb/></table>

Several conclusions can be extracted from<lb/> this Figure.<lb/></figure>

			<p>First of all, it is evident that the returns of European investment in regional cohesion increase as the<lb/> threshold of investment per capita per annum increases. The returns are higher at a 100 euro threshold than<lb/> at an 80 euro threshold. In turn, regions which receive more than 120 euros of structural and cohesion fund<lb/> expenditure per annum do better in growth terms than those getting a minimum of 100 euros. However, the<lb/> increase seems to stop at 120 euros, as there is virtually no difference between the returns experienced by<lb/> regions receiving more than 120 euros and those receiving more than 150 (please note that the two lines for<lb/> low quality of government for expenditure thresholds of 120 and 150 euros overlap). In this respect, our<lb/> results confirm that poor quality of government may be at the root of what <ref type="biblio">Becker et al. (2012)</ref> describe as<lb/> declining returns of regional development funds in Europe as the transfer intensity increases. These<lb/> authors, using a radically different method, reach the conclusion that in a considerable number of European<lb/> regions the transfer intensity of European regional funds exceeds what can be considered the efficiency<lb/> maximising level. They even highlight that, in some cases, a reduction of transfers would not affect<lb/> regional economic performance (<ref type="biblio">Becker et al. 2012</ref>).<lb/> Second, in all categories considered, regions with a higher quality of government perform<lb/> significantly better at the same level of cohesion expenditure than those with a lower quality of<lb/> government.<lb/></p>

			<p>Third, although increasing cohesion investment helps reduce the gap in the economic returns<lb/> experienced by high quality government and low quality government regions, this reduction is marginal<lb/> and does not suffice to overcome the quality of government gap which is the main explanation behind the<lb/> difference in the returns from cohesion expenditure of regions benefiting from a similar level of European<lb/> regional cohesion support.<lb/> To give a more precise idea of the dimension by which differences in quality of government trump the<lb/> potential effects of additional cohesion investment on regional growth, we have performed some<lb/> calculations based on <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The results indicate that above a certain threshold of cohesion expenditure<lb/> per capita, investing more in cohesion expenditure has positive, but very limited returns on the growth of<lb/> GDP per head. At levels of more than 80 euros in cohesion expenditure per head per annum, increasing the<lb/> amount of cohesion funds by one standard deviation in a region with a low quality of government yields an<lb/> added growth of a mere 1.9% above what would have been achieved had that additional investment not<lb/> taken place. The positive influence of any further cohesion investment declines as the investment threshold<lb/> rises: the additional impact on growth is of 1.7% above 100 euros of expenditure; 1.6% above 120; and<lb/> 1.5% above 150. By contrast, increasing the quality of government by that same standard deviation would<lb/> lead to significantly higher rises in growth. The additional impact of improving the quality of government<lb/> hovers just below 7% across all categories, with the exception of the 120 euro threshold (5.6%). The<lb/> positive impact of improvements in quality of government is somewhat lower for those regions which<lb/> benefit from levels of support which are considerably higher than the pre-established threshold. Yet, even<lb/> in those cases, improving the quality of government would yield greater returns than continuing to increase<lb/> cohesion expenditure. The additional effect of improving quality of government by one standard deviation<lb/> in these cases ranges between a minimum of 2.9% additional growth (above 120 euros) and a maximum of<lb/> 3.9% (above 100 euros).<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper we have analysed the extent to which the returns of European regional development and<lb/> cohesion investment across the whole of Europe are affected by the quality of the government of the<lb/> regions receiving the funds. The capital role played by government quality on the returns of public policy<lb/> has been strongly posited by the literature dealing with the economic implications of institutions. It has<lb/> also been indirectly presumed by the EU in its structural and cohesion policy by the mere fact of having<lb/> discussed a cap on the amount of resources which could be channelled to specific regions on the basis of<lb/> their capacity to absorb and adequately use funds. However, to date there has been no empirical<lb/> demonstration that quality of government is a strong mediator of the returns of European cohesion<lb/> investment and that regions with lower quality governments experience greater difficulties in transforming<lb/> structural and cohesion funds into greater economic growth and development.<lb/> Using the quality of government index of the Quality of Government Institute at the University of<lb/> Gothenburg (Quality of <ref type="biblio">Government Institute, 2010</ref>) and complementing it with the World Bank Global<lb/> Governance indicators, the results of our panel data analysis for the period between 1996 and 2007<lb/> demonstrate that, although at first sight quality of government does not appear to affect the returns of<lb/> European investments for all the regions in Europe, its effect as a moderator kicks in above a certain<lb/> threshold of expenditure. When a region receives a level of investment in cohesion and regional<lb/> development which can be considered more than testimonial, the quality of the local government becomes<lb/> a vital factor in determining the extent to which the regional development investment is transferred into<lb/> economic growth. This is clearly evident for regions where structural and cohesion funds represent more<lb/> than 80 euros per head per year. In these regions the importance of quality of government, both as a factor<lb/> for economic growth on its own and as a mediator for an efficient use of structural cohesion funds,<lb/> increases as the expenditure threshold rises. Beyond levels of cohesion expenditure which exceed 120<lb/> euros per person and per year the most efficient way to increase the returns of the European effort on<lb/> territorial cohesion is best done by an improvement of the quality of government of any given region.<lb/> Pouring more funds into the region will simply not do the trick.<lb/> Hence, it can be said that both EU investments targeting regions and quality of government make a<lb/> difference for regional economic growth, but above a certain threshold of expenditure (which our analysis<lb/> establishes at levels of cohesion expenditure of around 120 euros per person per annum), the quality of<lb/> government becomes the basic factor determining the returns of public investments. In many of the regions<lb/> receiving the bulk of structural funds, greater levels of cohesion expenditure would, in the best case<lb/> scenario, only lead to a marginal improvement in economic growth, unless the quality of the government is<lb/> significantly improved.<lb/> Overall, our analysis has contributed to the rapidly expanding literature on how institutions shape<lb/> economic performance and the returns of economic policy at a regional level in Europe (<ref type="biblio">Rodríguez-Pose,<lb/> 2013</ref>). As in the case of Beugelsdijk and van Schaik (2005a, 2005b) and Tabellini (2010), it demonstrates<lb/> how regional institutions in Europe are key shapers of economic performance. In particular, in has shown<lb/> that, in the case of European cohesion investment aiming at the development of regions, there are no<lb/> shortcuts: the returns to investment do not come necessarily from the degree of investment itself, but from<lb/> the quality of government of the region receiving the support. Improvements in the quality of government<lb/> are thus likely to lead to greater returns to public investment. In addition, the need to address quality of<lb/> government bottlenecks in order to maximise the returns of cohesion investment becomes all too evident<lb/> the greater the level of investment. In these regions, simply throwing greater amount of funds at areas with<lb/> inefficient and/or corrupt governments will lead to waste, unless the quality of government is seriously<lb/> improved.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our findings give thus support to the broad thrust of recent EU Cohesion Policy changes, aimed at<lb/> shifting to &apos;softer&apos; forms of infrastructure, while simultaneously setting up systems and incentives (linked to<lb/> results indicators, conditionalities, and greater monitoring) targeting the improvement of local governance<lb/> and institutions. They also raise warning signs for development policies elsewhere around the world. If<lb/> development policies are to be successful, they should build in an institutional component, including<lb/> promoting transparency and accountability and dealing with corruption as ways to improve the quality of<lb/> government, as an essential part of the strategic planning process. Otherwise the implementation of one-<lb/>size-fits-all policies may not yield the expected results. Taking into account place-based institutional<lb/> conditions and learning how institutional quality can be consistently improved hence needs to become a<lb/> basic element for any development strategy (<ref type="biblio">Barca et al. 2012</ref>).</p>
