and income inequality have remained broadly unchanged in recent years. Some social groups remain 
particularly vulnerable, including individuals in non-regular employment, the unemployed and the low 
skilled. If in employment, their jobs tend to be unstable and wages and income mobility low. Continued 
efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the most vulnerable 
groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the gaps between the 
rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. These efforts should include enhancing 
the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and increase upward income mobility among 
disadvantaged individuals; strengthening skills at the lower end of the skills distribution; revising the tax 
and benefit system to improve incentives and to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution; and to 
make health and old-age pension insurance more inclusive. This working paper relates to the 2014 OECD 
Economic Survey of Germany (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm). JEL Classification: I24, I32, O52 Key words: Germany, inclusive growth, income inequality, labour markets, education, health, old age 
poverty, taxation. ********** Rendre la croissance économique plus inclusive en Allemagne Alors que les réformes du marché du travail opérées dans le passé ont été bénéfiques en termes d'emploi, 
le risque de pauvreté relative et les inégalités de revenus n'ont quasiment pas changé ces dernières années. 
Certains groupes sociaux restent particulièrement vulnérables, notamment les personnes ayant un emploi 
précaire, les chômeurs et les personnes peu qualifiées. Lorsque les personnes concernées ont un travail, il 
s'agit généralement d'emplois peu stables, et les salaires sont bas et la mobilité salariale faible. Il est 
nécessaire de poursuivre les efforts, pour faire en sorte que les groupes les plus vulnérables puissent 
bénéficier d'une croissance économique plus vigoureuse et y contribuer, pour accroître la mobilité à la 
hausse des revenus parmi les personnes défavorisées et pour atténuer les inégalités. L'accent devrait être 
mis sur les instruments de l'action publique permettant à la fois de réduire les inégalités de revenus et de 
doper la croissance du PIB. Il s'agit notamment d'améliorer le devenir professionnel des plus vulnérables; 
de renforcer les compétences au bas de l'échelle de distribution des compétences; de réviser le système de 
prélèvements et de prestations pour améliorer les incitations; et assurer une redistribution efficiente et bien 
ciblée; et rendre l'assurance santé et l'assurance retraite plus inclusives. Ce document de travail se rapporte

Inequality and relative poverty in Germany are below levels observed in many OECD countries 
They have risen since the mid-90s, as elsewhere, although income inequality has not increased since 2004 
(Figure 1, bottom panel). GDP growth has benefited households with high incomes more than those with 
low incomes since the mid-1990s. The ratio of the top 10% to bottom 10% of disposable incomes has 
increased more than in many other OECD economies, especially before 2005. Relative poverty increased 
particularly in East Germany, affecting 20% in 2009, which is almost twice as much as in the West. While 
real disposable household income inequality in East and West Germany did not converge much in the early 
2000s, some convergence has occurred since 2005 (Grabka et al., 2012). Figure 1. Relative poverty¹ and income inequality² 1.

and transfers) is below 50% of the median income. 2.

to one (where one individual receives all). 3.

Thanks to the robust labour market, and in stark contrast to many other European countries, 
German household income has increased since 2007, benefitting incomes at both ends of the scale (OECD, 
2012 and 2013a). Nevertheless, despite sustained employment growth and a significant drop in 
unemployment, largely brought about by far-reaching labour market reforms in the mid-2000s (OECD, 
2012a), income inequality has not declined markedly over this period, either in absolute terms or relative to 
developments in OECD countries on average. The risk of relative poverty has, if anything, increased 
(OECD, 2013a). Kierzenkowski and Koske (2012) have identified a number of determinants of income 
inequality, some of them being particularly relevant for Germany (Box 1). Box 1. Determinants of rising income inequality and risk of relative poverty Skill-biased technological change: In many OECD countries, labour markets have become polarised, with 
computer technology depressing the middle of the wage and employment distributions where workers perform skilled 
but routine tasks, which leads to an increase in income inequality at the top end and a decrease at the low end. This 
pattern also appears in Germany (Dustmann et al., 2009; Spitz-Oener, 2006). Education: Wage inequality is negatively correlated with the average level of educational attainment. In Germany 
returns to education have been broadly stable over time (Prasad, 2004; OECD, 2013d). Higher educational attainment 
is also positively correlated with well-being, in part because of more rewarding jobs. International trade: Globalisation seems to have important implications for at least some groups of workers. In 
particular, offshoring appears to reduce employment and wages of medium-skilled workers performing routine tasks, 
thus reinforcing labour-market polarization. Immigration: Immigration has a small impact on native workers and sizeable adverse wage or employment 
effects on the cohorts of previous immigrants are found for Germany, implying only small effects for overall labour 
income inequality (D'Amuri et al., 2010; Steinhardt, 2011). Labour market regulation: It has been relaxed over the past 20 to 25 years in many OECD countries. The impact 
of declining unionisation and of the lower relative minimum wage, observed in many countries, is most pronounced at 
the lower end of the wage distribution. However, many such institutions (e.g. employment protection legislation, 
minimum wage) have opposite effects on employment and wage dispersion leaving the final impact on inequality 
undetermined (OECD, 2011). For Germany, there is little evidence that the labour market reforms in the mid-2000s 
have raised inequality. Household structure: Changes in the household structure, driven by a tendency towards more single households, 
are an important trigger for poverty at the microeconomic level (OECD, 2008a). Among others, the labour market 
reforms in the mid-2000s have generated incentives for subsistence payment beneficiaries to form single-households 
(Peichl et al., 2010). The formation of smaller households due to separation is likely to affect spouses with low 
earnings and their children most. Inequality is marked in market incomes, wealth and well-being indicators 3. 
Inequality in market incomes is higher than in many other OECD economies (Figure 2). The 
long-term increase in inequality of market incomes has been driven by rising disparities in labour incomes, 
and a particularly uneven distribution of self-employment incomes (OECD, 2012b). However, taxes and 
cash transfers play a larger role in mitigating market income inequality and risk of relative poverty than in 
most other countries. According to most recent data, the German tax-benefit system reduces inequality 
among the working-age population by almost 30%. ECO/WKP(2014)71 8 Figure 2. Effect of net taxes and transfers on income¹ inequality² Gini coefficient, 2010³ 1. 
Income refers to cash income excluding imputed components such as home production and imputed rents regularly received 
over the year. Market income (i.e. before taxes and transfers) includes earnings (broken down into those of the household head, 
of the spouse and of other household members); self-employment income; and capital income (rents, dividends and interest). 2. 
Income inequality is measured as Gini coefficient for equivalised household market income and disposable income for the total 
population. It ranges from zero (perfect equality) to one (where one individual receives all). 3.

Hungary, Mexico and Turkey. The OECD average is calculated as a population-weighted average of 26 countries available for 
2010. Source: OECD Income Distribution and Poverty database. 4. 
Besides income inequality at any given point in time, the likelihood of an individual to move up 
or down the income distribution (income mobility, often measured in moves across quintiles) also matters 
for life-time inequality. Workless and low-income households suffer particularly from low upward income 
mobility as it raises the likelihood of long-lasting or repeated spells of poverty (OECD, 2008a) and 
prevents them from benefiting from and contributing to more economic growth. It is therefore worrisome 
that equivalised disposable income mobility has declined particularly for low income households since the 
late 1990s (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011 and 2013), with income mobility being especially 
low in East Germany. Wage mobility also steadily declined between 1976 and 2008 (Aretz, 2013), raising 
the risk of relative poverty for workers in the low wage sector. Changes in job stability and employment 
characteristics, including unemployment history, tenure and type of industry, explain a significant share of 
this decline (Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011). 5. 
In-kind benefits paid for by governments, notably health and education services have an 
important redistributive effect, but they are not reflected in the monetary measures of income inequality 
and risk of relative poverty. Although government spending on in-kind benefits is comparatively high as a 
share of GDP, its redistributive effect is estimated to be relatively small, which may suggest poor targeting 
(OECD, 2011; Verbist et al., 2012; Adema et al., 2011). Wealth is less evenly distributed than income and has become more uneven (German Council of 
Economic Experts, 2009). It is also less evenly distributed across households than in other European 
economies (Figure 3). At 37%, the share of households without any property or wealth is comparatively 
large. The 10% wealthiest households earn 31% of gross incomes and own 59% of net wealth (Deutsche 
Bundesbank, 2013). ECO/WKP(2014)71 9 Figure 3. Distribution of household net wealth¹ Ratio of top to bottom quintile, 2009² 1.

A relatively large number of small households in Germany may account to some extent for the 
larger share of households with low wealth. Home ownership, which is the most important component of 
household net wealth, is highly concentrated among the wealthiest (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2013; Andrews 
and Caldera Sánchez, 2011). The tax regime may have encouraged wealthy households to invest in 
residential real estate (see below). The divergence of wealth between East and West Germany also 
contributes to the uneven distribution of wealth (Frick and Grabka, 2009). 7. 
According to the OECD well-being framework, which encompasses eleven domains covering 
both material and non-material living conditions, German households enjoy a relatively high level of 
economic welfare and perform well in most domains (OECD, 2013g). However, well-being outcomes for 
individuals with high income/high education are considerably better than for individuals with low 
income/low education in several domains. For instance, individuals with high income report a considerably 
better health status than individuals with low income. The strong impact of socio-economic background on 
education attainment also points towards inequalities in well-being outcomes (Figure 4). Moreover, 25% of 
individuals live in households where the total housing costs – net of housing allowances – represent 40% 
or more of their disposable income (10% OECD wide; OECD, 2013g). Identifying the most vulnerable to risks of poverty 8. 
Some social groups – including low skilled, individuals in non-regular employment and 
unemployed – are particularly vulnerable. They face a high risk of relative poverty and, if in employment, 
their jobs tend to be unstable, their wages low and their income mobility subdued. ECO/WKP(2014)71 10 Figure 4. Average well-being outcomes, 2013 Note: Indicators are normalized to range between 10 (best) and 0 according to the following formula: (indicator value -minimum

Low-wage employment increased between 2006 and 2010 and is particularly widespread among 
low skilled workers and women (Figure 5). While the share of low skilled individuals in the population is 
low, a relatively large share of low wage earners has low skills. This suggests that job matching is 
effective, but also that better targeted efforts to improve skills could considerably improve the income 
prospects of these workers. The large share of women in the low wage sector partly reflects the large gap 
between men and women in hourly wages. This may partly be due to more frequent and extended 
interruptions in working careers, a larger share of women who work part-time and differences in 
occupation (OECD, 2012h). The gender gap in full-time earnings is one of the largest among OECD 
countries. This is also true for the bottom quintile of full-time earners (OECD, 2013f). Figure 5. Low-wage earners¹ by educational attainment level², employment contract and gender As a percentage of employees³, 2010 1.

While past labour market reforms have put more workers into jobs, poverty risks are high for 
workers in non-regular employment (defined here as employees with relatively low employment protection 
or limited access to unemployment insurance), as well as many part-time and self-employed workers, 
especially those without employees (Table 1). As in other OECD countries, such workers are often paid 
low wages, suffer from low wage mobility and are less well protected than workers on permanent contracts 
(OECD, 2012a). ECO/WKP(2014)71 12 Table 1. Exposure to poverty of workers in non-regular, part-time and self-employment Risk of poverty

6.3 Note: The table refers to individuals aged 15-64, not in education or training. The risk of relative poverty is assessed on the basis of 
the mean equivalised disposable household income, at the 60% threshold. Non-regular employment consists here of temporary 
employees, workers in marginal employment (minijobs) and temporary agency workers. Overlaps among the different forms of non-
regular employment and part-time employment exist. Source: Federal Statistical Office of Germany. 11. 
Part-time work is particularly widespread among women: only 62% of employed women work 
full-time compared to 74% OECD-wide in 2012. Part-time work is characterised by a high risk of relative 
poverty. Also, their prospects of moving to full-time, permanent employment are often limited. They often 
face unstable employment, they tend to receive less in-work training and have poor chances to move up the 
income ladder. A considerable number of vulnerable part-timers is in marginal employment (minijobs, see 
Box 3 below). These vulnerabilities are attenuated to some extent at the household level, as many part-time 
workers are secondary earners. Nonetheless, even for secondary earners in high-income households part-
time employment may entail the risk of falling into relative poverty in the future, for example in the case of 
changes in the household, possibly as a result of separation. 12. 
The number of workers in employment receiving top-up subsistence benefits increased to 3% of 
total employment in 2011. Most are in marginal employment and 18% are single parents (Bruckmeier 
et al., 2013). Some 44% of individuals receiving subsistence payments who find a job continue to depend 
on top-up benefits and 45% are in employment for 6 months or less, which may reduce their income 
mobility (Koller and Rudolph, 2011). The unemployed face a very high risk of relative poverty 13. 
Many workers in non-regular employment acquire little or no unemployment insurance benefit 
entitlements, but face a high risk of unemployment. Lack of employment is particularly widespread among 
single parent households, which represent 5.9% of total households. Sixty-five per cent of single parents 
were in employment in 2008, less than in most other OECD countries, and labour market participation is 
particularly low for mothers with children aged 4 or less (Federal Ministry of Finance, 2012). Also 
individuals approaching retirement age are characterized by low employment and a high risk of relative 
poverty. 14. 
While long-term unemployment has decreased sharply in recent years, it continues to account for 
more than 40% of total unemployment. The long-term unemployed are particularly vulnerable to poverty 
risks, because longer unemployment spells reduce employability and workers lose their unemployment ECO/WKP(2014)71 13 insurance benefit entitlement. Low skilled workers are more likely to face long-term unemployment 
(Figure 6). Also older works face a high risk of long-term unemployment which, unlike for youth and 
prime-age individuals, is close to the EU average. The high incidence of long-term unemployment among 
older workers, including those with medium vocational qualifications, suggests that older workers with a 
narrow set of skills have difficulties to adapt to structural changes in the economy that may occur during 
their working life. Figure 6. Long-term unemployment¹ by demographic group² and education 3 As a percentage of labour force, 2012Q4 1.

The risk of relative poverty for immigrants is almost twice as high as for German nationals, in 
part because unemployment among immigrants is about twice as high. Moreover, the incidence of 
long-term unemployment is high, also in international comparison (OECD, 2012f). The high share of the 
low skilled among immigrants reduces their wages and employability (Koske et al., 2012). To some extent 
this is also true among second generation immigrants indicating the need to make integration policies more 
effective. Structural reforms to promote inclusive growth 16. 
Continued efforts are needed to foster economic growth in a more inclusive manner, such that the 
most vulnerable groups benefit from and contribute to economic growth more strongly and such that the 
gaps between the rich and the poor in terms of income and wellbeing are reduced. As discussed below, 
more inclusive growth requires enhancing the labour market outcomes of the most vulnerable and 
improving skills at the lower end of the skills distribution, as well as reforms of the tax and benefit system 
to ensure efficient and well-targeted redistribution. The focus should be on policy instruments which entail 
a double dividend by reducing income inequality and boosting GDP growth at the same time. Going for 
Growth 2012 has benchmarked a number of policy instruments against these two objectives (Box 2; 
OECD, 2012g). ECO/WKP(2014)71 14 Box 2. Policy instruments and their impact on inequality and economic growth General policy trade-offs and complementarities between growth and income distribution objectives as identified 
in Going for Growth 2012 are summarized in Table 2.  Policies which reduce income inequality and at the same time boost long-run GDP per capita include instruments to raise human capital while making it less dependent on personal and social circumstances, 
reducing labour market duality, promoting the integration of immigrants and fostering female labour market 
participation. Some tax policies, notably to reduce tax expenditures, contributes to equity objectives while 
also allowing a growth-friendly cut in effective marginal tax rates, in particular for lower income recipients.  Several policies may entail a trade-off between reducing income inequality and raising GDP per capita. For instance, administrative extensions of collective wage agreements may reduce wage earnings dispersion 
among workers, but they may harm competition and productivity and possibly reduce employment. Shifting 
the tax mix to less-distorting taxes -in particular away from labour and corporate income taxes towards 
consumption, proper pricing of environmental externalities and real estate taxes -would improve incentives 
to work, save and invest, but may require additional steps to address adverse implications for equity. Table 2. The impact of structural reforms on inequality and GDP per capita A rise in:

There is scope to help the most vulnerable to improve their labour market outcomes, which 
would boost growth and at the same time address the uneven distribution of market incomes. Three reform 
areas deserve particular attention: avoiding low employment and low pay traps, avoiding a dual labour 
market and strengthening active labour market policies (ALMP). Removing barriers to full-time employment would reduce poverty risks 18. 
Policies that discourage full-time employment should be carefully reviewed as they tend to 
reduce upwards income mobility of vulnerable individuals and growth. This section argues that the high 
incidence of part-time employment is favoured by the tax treatment of marginal employment and the ECO/WKP(2014)71 15 limited supply of full-time childcare facilities, which also makes it difficult for families with children to 
fully participate in economic activity. Avoiding low employment and low pay traps 19. 
Marginal employment (so-called minijobs) refers to low income employment contracts of up to 
EUR 450 per month, which benefit from tax subsidies, are partially exempt from the mandatory public 
pension system and fully exempt from unemployment insurance (Box 3). minijobs were intended as a 
stepping stone towards permanent full-time employment relationships but a success has not been proven. 
Reduced income tax and social security rates are phased out between EUR 450 and EUR 850 via so-called 
midijobs, thereby implying high marginal tax rates for individuals willing to work more (Freier and 
Steiner, 2007; Körner et al., 2013; Fertig and Kluve, 2007). Workers in minijobs tend to suffer from low 
in-work training opportunities and low wage mobility, locking them into their marginal employment status 
(Voss and Weinkopf, 2012). Some workers on minijobs are exposed to a rising risk of relative poverty 
once they retire or in case of losing their job (Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012) because they acquire low 
pension entitlements and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. As the tax subsidy is not 
targeted to low income individuals, many minijobs are taken up by second earners to avoid high taxation in 
the context of the joint income taxation of couples. Minijobs also create an additional tax advantage for 
workers with more than one job, one of them being marginal employment, as income from other jobs does 
not count towards the minijob income ceiling. The number of individuals using marginal employment as 
side job has almost doubled since 2004 and accounted for 34% of all individuals with a minijob in 2011 
(Hohendanner and Stegmaier, 2012). Minijobs should be better targeted towards low-wage workers. For 
example, tax subsidies should not be provided for combining jobs, one of them being a minijob. Box 3. Minijobs -characteristics and incidence Minijobs refer to employment contracts for earnings of currently up to EUR 450 per month with reduced income 
tax and social security contribution rates and entitlements. Mandatory social security contribution rates amount to 
roughly 29%, compared to 39% or more for permanent full-time employment. Unlike the case of permanent full-time 
employment, compulsory social security contributions are fully paid by employers. Since 2013 individuals can opt out 
of full pension coverage by not paying the employees' pension contribution rate of 3.9%, on top of the employer's 
mandatory contribution of 15%. In practice, this option leaves a considerably share of individuals in marginal 
employment with limited entitlement once they retire. Workers in marginal employment do not contribute to 
unemployment insurance and are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. They are subject to income tax at a 
flat-rate of 2%. Many individuals in marginal employment, about 5.5 million in total, are students, pensioners or second 
earners (Table 3). Table 3. Persons exclusively on a minijob, 2010 %

11.2 Source: Körner et al. (2013). Midijobs, referring to earnings between EUR 450 and EUR 850, are subject to reduced social insurance contributions as well, but with 
rates increasing gradually to the standard rates. There were 1.37 million midijobs in 2011. ECO/WKP(2014)71 16 Further expansion of childcare to facilitate full-time employment 20. 
Sufficient and affordable formal childcare facilitates the labour market integration of single 
parents and improves earnings prospects, especially for low income households (Rainer et al., 2011; Rainer 
et al., 2013). A lack of childcare facilities is of particular concern for single parents as they and their 
children are subject to high poverty risks in Germany (Zabel, 2011). Formal childcare also favours other 
family policy goals, such as increasing fertility and improving work-life balance. Figure 7. Public expenditure on childcare and early education services As a percentage of GDP, 2009 Note: Aggregate spending for Spain. Source: OECD Family database. 21. 
Germany is making progress in expanding childcare and has guaranteed access for all parents, if 
only for a few hours per day. However, enrolment rates in early childcare (one-to-two-year-olds) remain 
low and access to full-time care is limited. One reason is comparatively low total public spending on 
childcare and early education (see Figure 7), although it has increased in recent years. Since August 2013 
parents have a legal claim to public care for children aged one year or more. In practice, however, several 
conditions may prevent parents from enforcing this right. For instance they cannot reject offered places, 
even if they imply longer commuting distance. Moreover, the availability of full-time care remains limited, 
also for pupils more than 5 years old (Blossfeld et al., 2013; OECD, 2014). Efforts should continue to 
expand early childcare, notably full-time care and all-day school provision. 22. 
Attendance at formal childcare is particularly low among children from low income households 
or with a migrant background (Spieß et al., 2008; Blossfeld et al., 2013; Authoring Group Educational 
Reporting, 2013). While 33% of children without migration background attend childcare at the age of zero 
to 3 years, only 16% of children with migration background do so (Federal Statistical Office, 2012). These 
households are often less informed about the benefits of formal childcare and may particularly be 
discouraged by high fees. However early childcare and childhood education is an important determinant of 
learning outcomes later on (Heckman and Masterov, 2007). The most seriously disadvantaged children 
reap particularly large cognitive and non-cognitive skill gains (Heckman and Raut, 2013). Children with 
migrant background also benefit by acquiring language through education (OECD, 2008a). Further efforts 
and resources are needed to raise the participation of children with weak socio-economic background in 
early childcare and early childhood education. Fees are set by municipalities and thus vary considerably 
across regions (Gathmann and Sass, 2012). Equal access to affordable high-quality childcare should be 
ensured independently of place of residence and socio-economic background. ECO/WKP(2014)71 17 Avoiding a dual labour market 23. 
The gap between employment protection of permanent workers with long seniority and 
temporary workers is large in Germany (Figure 8). One reason is that Germany is the OECD country with 
the most far-reaching employment protection legislation for workers with open-ended contracts. A reform 
in 2011 tightened regulation of temporary agency workers and the 2013 coalition agreement spelled out 
plans to go somewhat further in this direction by requiring equal pay between in-house workers and 
temporary agency workers with equal tasks after 9 months. In contrast, the use of fixed-term contracts has 
been eased substantially since the late 1990s and regulation of temporary contracts is now among the least 
restrictive among OECD countries (Eichhorst and Tobsch, 2013). For example, it is under certain 
conditions possible to use multiple successive fixed-term contracts with the same employee (European 
Court of Justice, 2012), generating incentives to substitute regular work contracts with fixed-term 
contracts. Figure 8. Protection of temporary and regular workers Scale 0 (least restrictions) to 6 (most restrictions), 2013 1. 
Aggregate contributions of employment protection for regular workers against individual dismissals and additional cost of 
collective dismissals. Source: OECD (2013), Employment Outlook. 24. 
Permanent employment has contributed strongly to employment growth in Germany in recent 
years. Thirty nine per cent of workers on temporary contracts moved to a permanent contract within one 
year (Walwei, 2013). However, international evidence shows that a large gap in employment protection 
between permanent and temporary workers often tends to thwart employability (de Serres et al., 2012), 
increases inequality (Box 1) and hampers the transition from non-regular employment to permanent full-
time employment. It thereby also lowers wage mobility (Riphahn and Schnitzlein, 2011; Koske et al., 
2012). Against this backdrop, the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary 
workers should be reduced to further improve the transition of workers in temporary employment 
relationships into permanent jobs. The strict regulation of regular employment should be reviewed along ECO/WKP(2014)71 18 the lines suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Simultaneously the regulation of fixed term 
contracts should be reviewed as well. In particular, the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with 
the same employee should be limited in scope. A minimum wage consistent with preserving employment 25. 
A minimum wage may be an effective instrument to reduce the dispersion of wages while 
preserving employment prospects (Garloff, 2010; Card and Krueger, 1995). It may also limit the need for 
benefit top-ups the government pays to low-wage recipients. Negative employment effects are less likely to 
occur when employers' bargaining power is high and workers' bargaining power is low (Koske et al., 
2012). In such cases there is potential for redistribution of rents without reducing employment. For 
example, low wealth and low income (especially in the absence of unemployment benefit entitlement) can 
push job searchers to accept jobs paying below the marginal product in order to avoid the costs of 
continuing searching. Search models show that a minimum wage may even generate positive employment 
effects, as a minimum wage raises incentives for individuals to work and improve their skills (Acemoglu 
and Pischke, 2001; OECD, 2008b). The experience of the United Kingdom, which implemented a fairly 
low minimum wage relative to the median wage in 1999, but subsequently increased it substantially in 
several steps, shows that employment has not fallen due to the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage 
(OECD, 2004), and was also not affected by the increase in minimum wage during the recent economic 
and financial crisis (Bryan et al., 2012). 26. 
Currently, a minimum wage can be set for individual sectors, which has been done in several 
cases in Germany, mostly on the basis of extending collectively bargained wages. Two procedures exist to 
set a sector specific minimum wage (see Box 4). The extension of collective wage agreements incurs the 
risk of harming employment prospects of  " outsiders " . For instance, legal extension of sectoral wage 
agreements can reduce incentives of social partners to set wages low enough for unemployed to have a 
reasonable chance of finding a job, as no employer can compete by reducing costs with a lower wage. Box 4. Procedures to set sector specific minimum wages There are two main procedures to implement a sector-specific minimum wage. If (1) a minimum of 50% of employees are covered by collective agreements and (2) there is a public interest, a 
collective agreement can be declared as generally binding for all employees in the region and sector. To introduce 
such a sectoral and regional minimum wage, employers' associations and trade unions of the sector have to file a joint 
application for legal extension with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, specifying the agreed minimum 
wage. Once accepted by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the agreement is binding for all employees 
and employers in the sector. If the government of a Land contests a proposal for legal extension, consent by the 
federal government is needed. If less than 50% of all employees in a sector are employed by employers who are bound by collective 
agreements a permanent council can propose a sectoral minimum wage. The permanent council consists of two 
representatives of employers of the sectors concerned, two representatives of labour unions of the sectors concerned 
and three representatives from the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Alternatively, an expert commission, 
composed of three representatives of employers and three from labour unions, and, optionally, experts without voting 
rights, can propose a minimum wage, which can be introduced by the federal government. Sectoral minimum wages are in place in several branches and occupations: construction and related crafts, 
(safety services, cleaning services, long-term care, vocational education and further training services and waste 
management). A minimum wage also exists for temporary agency workers. Sectoral minimum wages in Germany 
varied between EUR 7.50 per hour and EUR 13.70 per hour in 2013. Many of these minimum wages vary across 
regions. ECO/WKP(2014)71 19 Raising wages via the legal extension of collective wage agreements may also be a way for incumbents to 
prevent the entry of firms and thereby thwart competition and employment. Moreover, sectoral minimum 
wages can be circumvented by outsourcing activity to firms in other sectors or to the self-employed, which 
are then more likely to generate precarious job conditions. These substitution efforts will reduce in-house 
training activities and further contribute to the risks of a dual labour market (OECD, 2008a, 2006 and 
2012g). An extensive evaluation study commissioned by the German Ministry of Labour in 2011 covering 
all sectors with minimum wages failed to find any substantial negative effects on employment and market 
entry in the sectors concerned. However, employment losses may have resulted due to indirect effects on 
other sectors (van Suntum, 2014). 27. 
The government plans to phase in a general minimum wage of EUR 8.50 between 2015 and the 
end of 2016 and to create a commission to propose future adjustments of the general minimum wage. The 
members of the commission will be nominated by social partners, with the possibility to consult 
independent experts, who will have no voting power. Sectoral minimum wages above the general 
minimum wage will continue to apply and the government plans to make it easier to legally extend 
collectively bargained sectoral minimum wages above the general minimum wage. At present, several of 
these sectoral minimum wages are higher than EUR 8.50. 28. 
The government's plans to introduce a general minimum wage are welcome. However it should 
be ensured that the initial level does not entail considerable negative employment effects. A minimum 
wage of EUR 8.50 would amount to about half of the median wage, placing the German minimum wage at 
a level similar to those of other European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but below 
France. It would affect about 15% of employees nation-wide and more than 23% in Eastern Germany. It 
may harm the employment prospects of workers in some regions and with little experience or low skills 
(Brenke, 2014). A useful strategy would be to introduce the minimum wage at a lower level and make 
adjustments in the light of its impact, as was done in the United Kingdom. The mandate of the expert 
commission should be to set the minimum wage at a level which balances potential employment losses 
against the social benefits. The social partners alone may not sufficiently take the interests of the 
unemployed into account. It could therefore be desirable to involve independent experts or government 
representatives in the commission's decisions. Moreover, given the introduction of the nationwide 
minimum wage, cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of 
collective agreements. Active labour market policies and in-work benefits could be improved 29. 
Total spending on ALMPs is relatively high (Figure 9) and spending per unemployed has 
increased by almost 50% since 2007. Spending increased particularly for training and integrating the 
disabled, in line with recommendations in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. However, spending per 
unemployed on public employment services increased sharply as well and is now unusually high. While in 
many cases ALMPs are found to be counterproductive, i.e. rather extending the time of unemployment 
(Federal Government, 2006), placement services and hiring subsidies are found to be particularly effective 
in the short-term, whereas instruments aiming at improving education outcomes take more time to unfold 
their effects but are considered to be more beneficial in the long-term (Kluve, 2013). ECO/WKP(2014)71 20 Figure 9. Spending on labour market programmes¹ USD thousands at PPP per unemployed person, 2011 1. 
Spending per unemployed person for a country is adjusted for national income by multiplying this number by the ratio of US 
over each country's GDP per capita. 2.

Many ALMPs benefit mostly those with a comparatively strong socio-economic background 
within their respective target groups. Vouchers -including for education and private job placement 
services -as well as hiring subsidies are more often taken up and actually used by individuals with a 
comparatively strong socio-economic background. Self-selection effects within target groups may persist, 
in part because better educated individuals are often better informed and less discouraged (Heyer et al., 
2011). 31. 
Hiring subsidies (Eingliederungszuschuss), which are considered to be effective in bringing long-
term unemployed and migrants back to work, could be targeted more towards the neediest (Butschek and 
Walter, 2013; Heyer et al., 2011). For example hiring subsidies could become more generous for the most 
disadvantaged individuals with the longest unemployment spells. Hiring subsidies could be accompanied 
to a larger extent by incentives to achieve higher general education to ensure a lasting integration of 
disadvantaged individuals in the labour market and increase income mobility (Kluve, 2013). 32. 
Steps have been taken to raise the incentives of public employment service offices to direct 
efforts more towards bringing the most disadvantaged individuals into work in 2014, including the 
long-term unemployed and low skilled. These steps are welcome. However, continued assistance and 
guidance following placement, during the initial period in work, is also needed to ensure lasting integration 
into the labour market. Also incentives of providers of private job placement services should be reviewed, 
as these vouchers benefit mostly job searchers with relatively high employability (Heyer et al., 2011). 33. 
There is scope to further review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive 
sufficient support while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, means-tested subsistence benefits 
are currently phased out as earnings rise above EUR 100. While the phasing out is already slower for 
families with children, the benefits could be phased out more slowly for particularly vulnerable 
individuals, such as single parents (Meister, 2009). Child benefits paid to parents receiving a housing 
allowance could also be phased out more slowly to remove disincentives to work. Currently they are 
discontinued abruptly at a certain income level. ECO/WKP(2014)71 21 The education system could provide more support for the disadvantaged 34. 
PISA results in Germany have improved in all three PISA domains and are now above the OECD 
average. These improvements were mostly due to better results among students coming from a lower 
socio-economic or immigrant background (OECD, 2013i and 2014). However, the link between 
socioeconomic background and mathematics performance remains strong compared to the OECD average 
and immigrants remain more disadvantaged than nationals (Figure 10). A strong link between socio-
economic background and learning outcomes undermines employment prospects and income mobility of 
the most vulnerable. Figure 10. Impact of socio-economic status on the average difference in performance in mathematics¹ 2012 1. 
The average difference in mathematics score between students whose socio-economic status differs by one unit of the PISA 
index of economic, social and cultural status. The lower the value the smaller the difference (or the more equal performance 
between advantaged and disadvantaged students). Source: OECD (2013), PISA 2012 Results: Excellence through Equity, Giving Every Student the Chance to Succeed, Vol. II, 
preliminary version. Reviewing system level policies 35. 
Further reforms are needed to improve learning outcomes and facilitate access to upper 
secondary and tertiary education among disadvantaged youth. Performance variation between schools is 
relatively large, reflecting in large part stratification of the school system (OECD, 2012c) and a high share 
of disadvantaged students going to disadvantaged schools (OECD, 2013i). Efforts should be made to 
continue to reduce stratification of the school system as recommended in the 2008 Economic Survey of 
Germany. Also, grade repetition, which is particularly widespread in Germany, should be reduced. It 
widens inequity, increases the likelihood of dropping out and does not improve education outcomes 
(OECD, 2012c). Moreover, grade repetition raises total expenditure on primary and secondary education 
by 7%. Moreover, efforts should continue to remove financial barriers to access to tertiary education. The 
main federal means-tested student support scheme provides grants and loans with income contingent 
repayments of up to EUR 8 040 per year for needy students. However, consideration should be given to 
raising the maximum amount of support and to making all loan repayments contingent. While an additional 
preferential student loan scheme provides loans of up to EUR 7 200 per year, their repayment is not 
contingent on income. 36. 
A relatively large share of pupils with learning difficulties is separated from the mainstream and 
placed in classes or schools for children with learning difficulties or disabilities (Figure 11, top panel; 
OECD, 2012c). Pupils are more likely to be assigned to such special needs schools if their socio-economic 
background is disadvantaged. For example, children with migrant background are overrepresented in ECO/WKP(2014)71 22 special needs schools. Also, the share of pupils in special needs schools varies considerably across Länder 
(Figure 11, bottom panel). Assignment of pupils to special needs schools undermines their career prospects 
early on, as many of them leave school without having completed even lower secondary education. 
Instead, integrating children with learning difficulties in mainstream classes and schools raises their 
education outcomes and is less costly (OECD, 2009). In this context, the initiative by the Länder to 
promote integrated education is welcome (Kultusministerkonferenz, 2010). A coherent strategy should be 
developed for integrated education across Länder, limiting assignment of children to separate special needs 
education, and avoiding that children with disadvantaged socio-economic background are assigned to them 
on account of their weak socio-economic status. Figure 11. Special education needs 1.

Most young people who do not obtain at least upper secondary education face a high risk of 
unemployment or, if in employment, low wages (OECD, 2013b). In Germany, 10.6% of youth aged 18-24 
have at most lower secondary education and are not in education or training, many of them with migrant 
background, according to Eurostat; about 8% do not complete lower secondary education. While special 
training measures exist to integrate these youth into vocational education and training (VET), they are 
often not successful. Around 260 000 youth (26 % of all youth entering VET per year) attended special 
training programmes in 2012 (Federal Statistical Office of Germany, 2014). Half of them are expected to 
not successfully complete formal VET (Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013; Klemm, 2012). 
Against this backdrop greater efforts are needed to help early school leavers to achieve at least upper 
secondary education. Guaranteeing direct access to VET to all school leavers, an idea also spelled out in ECO/WKP(2014)71 23 the 2013 coalition agreement, would require additional resources of about EUR 1.5 billion per year, 
according to Klemm (2012). However, this cost is likely to be partially recovered through higher tax 
revenues in the long-term. To achieve this goal, existing training programmes need to be tailored more 
towards bringing youth quickly into mainstream VET programmes in close cooperation with private 
companies (Plicht, 2010). The federal government and governments of the Länder are setting up a 
programme (education chains) to streamline the existing initiatives in vocational orientation and to 
strengthen the transition from school into mainstream VET. In 2013 the Länder jointly made proposals to 
improve school-based training programs in the transition system. Some of these policies to make economic 
growth more socially inclusive also require additional public funding. 38. 
Efforts should also continue to raise the employability of older workers and immigrants. Lifelong 
learning can help to improve employability among experienced workers, thereby reducing poverty risks as 
suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. Specialisation early on should be avoided as older 
workers, who face a high risk of long-term unemployment (Figure 5), are particularly vulnerable to 
structural changes. Despite recent reforms, difficulties in the recognition of professional and vocational 
qualifications obtained abroad hold back earnings prospects of immigrants. The Federal Recognition Act, 
in force since April 2012, has proved effective. The first data show that in most cases the equivalence of 
foreign professional qualifications was established and the recognition was granted. However, differences 
continue to exist in the recognition of foreign credentials across Länder. This limits the capacity of 
immigrants to move to locations where their skills are in highest demand (OECD, 2013e). The recognition 
of professional and vocational qualifications should be furthered facilitated, as planned by the government, 
and harmonized across Länder. Providing more targeted support to disadvantaged pupils 39. 
The share of public spending on compulsory schooling directed to children of low-income 
families is lower than in most other OECD countries (Verbist et al., 2012). As in many OECD countries, 
there is scope to provide more financial resources to schools with a comparatively high share of pupils with 
weak socio-economic background (OECD, 2012c). For instance, considerable differences exist in spending 
per pupil across school tracks with spending per pupil being lower in middle schools (Realschule) than in 
high schools (Gymnasium). Also modern secondary schools (Hauptschulen) have difficulties in attracting 
qualified teachers (Authoring Group Educational Reporting, 2013), indicating that their employment 
conditions need to be improved. More financial and career incentives should be provided to attract and 
retain high quality teachers and leaders in schools attended by disadvantaged children also with regard to 
the large share of older teachers currently on active duty (OECD, 2014). It should be ensured that teachers 
earn the same across different school tracks. To address learning gaps and avoid grade repetition, which is 
relatively high, it should be ensured that an adequate environment for learning is made available to the 
most disadvantaged children, including for counselling, mentoring and smoothing transitions between the 
different levels of education (OECD, 2012c). 40. 
To further increase the benefits of existing early childhood education and care additional 
resources should be made available: to increase the staff-child ratio; to provide more integrated education 
and care; and to ensure early childhood professionals (e.g. educators, pedagogues, etc.) have better 
qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions, as planned by 
the government (OECD, 2012e; Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs, 2013). The Länder have 
developed a competence-oriented qualification profile for childcare workers in order to enhance and 
harmonize the quality of training programmes (Kultusministerkonferenz, 2011) and have made efforts to 
establish training courses at tertiary level. In the short term, however shortages of qualified staff need to be 
addressed. 41. 
The education package (Bildungspaket) is an initiative by the federal government to help children 
from poor households to participate in social activities and receive learning support. However, it may fail ECO/WKP(2014)71 24 to reach the most vulnerable, despite means-testing, because of self-selection (Krug and Popp, 2008). 
Disadvantaged parents, including those with migrant background, are less likely to be aware of education 
support programmes for their children (Apel and Engels, 2012) and they tend to underestimate the long-
term benefits of such activities. Therefore, continued effort is needed to ensure that the neediest children 
benefit from the programme, for example by continuing to tailor information and assistance towards these 
families. It should also be ensured that more funds are allocated to tutoring of disadvantaged children to 
improve their learning outcomes. Currently, this is only possible if a teacher certifies that a child is at risk 
of repeating a school year. Only 4% of children from families receiving subsistence payments or housing 
subsidies receive such support (Apel and Engels, 2012). Providing more funding for tutoring to 
disadvantaged children independently of whether they are at risk of repeating a school year could help 
them to perform better at school, which might encourage them to aim for higher education later on. Reforming health insurance to tackle inequalities 42. 
The segmentation of health insurance into a private sector, which covers about 10% of the 
population, and a public sector, which covers the remaining 90% (Box 5) raises efficiency concerns 
(OECD, 2008b; German Council of Economic Experts, 2006). Low and middle income earners and 
individuals with poorer health status are generally covered by public health insurance, where contributions 
are independent of health risks and proportional to wage income up to a ceiling. Employees with a wage 
income above EUR 53 550 per year can opt out of public insurance and choose private insurance instead. 
High income earners with good health status have incentives to choose private insurance because insurance 
premia do not depend on income and because private insurers can adjust the terms of contracts they offer 
to new insurees in line with their perceived health risks. Moreover, private insurers do not participate in the 
central health fund, which redistributes insurance contributions of public insurers on the basis of risk-
adjusted transfers. The central health fund helps to avoid selection on the basis of risk (Box 3.5; OECD, 
2008b). Private insurers can therefore compete on the basis of risk selection rather than on the basis of 
efficiency. Moreover, competition within the private insurance sector is de facto limited to attracting new 
entrants to the private system. New insurees can be selected on the basis of risk in most contracts, making 
individuals reluctant to switch, for example, after facing chronic conditions. Moreover, switching between 
private insurance providers is costly due to the restricted portability of ageing reserves (Box 5). 43. 
Private insurance can also result in poverty risks for some individuals when they experience a 
drop in income. These risks affect older workers, because insurance premia tend to increase with age and 
because they cannot return to the public insurance system. They also affect the self-employed, who do not 
generally have access to public insurance and may face high income uncertainty. It is therefore possible 
that the current health insurance system discourages risk-averse workers from becoming self-employed, 
especially if their business plans imply uncertain income prospects, as may particularly be the case for 
innovative start-ups. While special tariffs have to be provided by private health insurance companies for 
individuals who have difficulties in paying, they can be fairly expensive or provide only limited coverage 
(Box 5; Federal Ministry of Health, 2013a). While the dual health insurance system in Germany has a long 
tradition, it generates difficulties in today's labour market, in which employment histories often include 
changes in employment status and earnings. ECO/WKP(2014)71 25 44. 
The German Council of Economic Experts (2006) and the 2008 OECD Economic Survey of 
Germany therefore suggested integrating private health insurance providers in the central health fund. The 
German Council of Economic Experts also suggested imposing the obligation to contract on all insurers 
and limiting the cost of mandatory health insurance for low-income households with government transfers. 
This would imply that all insurance companies provide mandatory health insurance packages to all 
individuals on equal terms, as public insurance companies already do. Such a reform would remove 
incentives for risk selection and reduce poverty risks. However, it would give rise to substantial transitory 
challenges. In particular, it requires dealing with the reserves accumulated in the private health insurance 
system. 45. 
While the introduction of the central health fund (see Box 5) has raised efficiency and 
transparency, it should be developed further (Drösler et al., 2011). As only a limited number of 80 diseases 
are considered to determine risk-adjusted transfers, public health insurance companies continue to have Box 5. The German health insurance system Healthcare coverage is provided through a mix of public health insurance, which covers about 90% of the 
population, and private health insurance for eligible individuals who opted out of the public system, including many civil 
servants. Public health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently below EUR 53 550 must be insured in 
the public health insurance system. Non-profit public insurers are funded mostly via the central health fund, which 
collects 15.5% of labour income from all insured (14.6 percentage points are equally shared by employer and 
employee and 0.9 percentage points are paid by the employee alone) and then distributes funds to insurers as risk-
adjusted transfers. Individual insurers compete mainly via additional lump-sum surcharges which they can levy on their 
clients (up to a limit of 2% of the income of the insured individual). The federal government contributed 7.4% to the 
central health fund's revenues in 2012 (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013a). Non-working spouses and children up to a 
certain age are insured at no extra cost if they have no income above EUR 395 (or EUR 450 out of a minijob). Public 
insurers are subject to the obligation to accept every individual fulfilling the criteria for access to the public scheme and 
wishing to conclude a contract with them and cannot vary premia according to individual risk. The 2013 coalition 
agreement stipulates abolishing the lump sum surcharges which can be levied by individual insurers, replacing them 
by income dependent surcharges to be paid by the employee. Private health insurance: Employees with gross yearly earnings currently exceeding EUR 53 550 can opt out of 
the public health insurance scheme. The self-employed must insure themselves in the private sector unless they were 
insured in the public sector before becoming self-employed, in which case they can choose between public and private 
insurance. Civil servants are reimbursed 50% of their healthcare costs by their employers if they take out private 
insurance. Premia do not depend on income and, in general, insurers can charge higher fees to new clients depending 
on their perceived health risks. Private health insurance companies are obliged to build up old age reserves for their 
clients, which are in principle portable if switching between private health insurance providers (Commonwealth Fund, 
2012). However, switching between private insurance providers is costly because the scope of portable ageing 
reserves is restricted to that of the basic tariff and to insurees who joined private health insurance after 2008. 
Therefore, in practice competition among private health insurance companies is limited to attracting new entrants to 
the private system. Private insurers are obliged to offer special tariffs for individuals having difficulties in paying for their health 
insurance. The basic and the standard tariff provide coverage comparable to the one of public insurance, but these 
tariffs cost up to EUR 610 per month in 2013 regardless of income. Income support is provided by the government only 
if the privately insured's income risks falling below the subsistence threshold. For individuals who fall behind with their 
contribution payments, an emergency tariff (Notlagentarif) was introduced in 2013 with a premium not higher than 
EUR 125. However, it provides considerably less coverage than public insurance (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013b). The transition from private health insurance back to public health insurance is only possible under certain, narrow 
circumstances. Employees whose income falls below the income threshold can switch to the public system if they are 
less than 55 years old. In principle switching is not possible for the self-employed. ECO/WKP(2014)71 26 incentives to discriminate against clients with diseases not included in the adjustment, for example 
including some forms of mental ill health. Despite an obligation to contract, public insurance companies 
can influence their client structure to some extent, for instance by advertising their services to selected 
groups. Therefore, the current risk-adjustment should be reviewed and include a larger number of diseases. 46. 
Unlike in other countries with central health funds, the treatment costs of deceased individuals 
are not annualized when determining disease specific transfers. For higher age groups and diseases with 
high death tolls costs are systematically underestimated and thus transfers from the central health fund too 
low (Buchner et al., 2012). It should be ensured that risk-adjusted transfers are set high enough for clients 
with cost-intensive diseases characterized by high morbidity as also spelled out in the 2013 coalition 
agreement. Limiting the risk of rising old age poverty 47. 
Although old age poverty is not a major concern in Germany today, this is expected to change as 
population ageing and past pension reforms will reduce the level of pensions in the public system relative 
to income earned during active life (German Council of Economic Experts, 2013). Net pension 
replacement rates for future retirees are among the lowest across OECD countries, especially for workers 
earning half the average wage and retiring after a full career (OECD, 2013h). One reason is that pension 
claims are more closely related to income than in most other OECD countries. In this context, the rise of 
low pay-jobs, low wage mobility and emerging labour market dualisation aggravate risks of old-age 
poverty. Helping workers to acquire sufficient pension claims over their working life by improving 
earnings prospects of workers subject to low-pay and part-time work is the best way to tackle the risk of 
old age poverty. In this context labour market reforms to boost permanent full-time employment as 
outlined above are particularly helpful. 48. 
The 2013 coalition agreement includes several measures to extend pension claims for selected 
groups. Workers with a contribution record of at least 45 years will be able to retire with a full pension at 
age 63 initially, rising to 65 years, in line with the increase of the standard legal pension age from 65 to 
67 years. If implemented, they provide an incentive to retire earlier. Pension top-ups will also be paid to 
mothers whose children were born before 1992 and invalidity pensions will be raised. In the medium term, 
these measures will be funded by payroll contributions, which are projected to be 0.4 percentage points 
higher as a result of the planned measures by 2030. There are also plans to implement a minimum pension 
for people with a contribution record of at least 40 years and low pension entitlements at a later stage. The 
plans are not specifically targeted at addressing old-age poverty, which could become a problem in decades 
to come, and thus may generate more spending pressures in the future. If pension entitlements for workers 
with a low earnings record are deemed too low, a cost effective way of raising incomes for pensioners with 
low entitlements while safeguarding incentives to work would be to phase out means-tested subsistence 
benefits more slowly as pension entitlements rise. 49. 
The mandatory public pension system generally covers employees only. Only about one quarter 
of the self-employed, mainly in professional services, are covered by alternative mandatory pension 
schemes (German Council of Economic Experts, 2011). The remaining self-employed workers, often 
including the most vulnerable, are not covered (German Council of Economic Experts, 2013). They may 
not sufficiently price in future pension requirements to offer their goods and services at a low price. This 
creates a coverage gap raising the risk that self-employed workers have to rely on social assistance benefits 
during retirement. Firms have incentives to outsource work to these self-employed workers at low cost in 
order to avoid pension contributions, raising precarious self-employment and weakening government 
finances. Against this backdrop, all self-employed should be included in the mandatory public pension 
scheme. ECO/WKP(2014)71 27 Making the tax system more inclusive 50. 
The labour tax wedge is high in international comparison, including for low income families and 
single parents (Table 4). While income tax rates are low, especially for families with children, social 
security contributions are high. Table 4. Tax wedge by family type and wage level % of gross wage earnings, 2012 Family type

Lowering social security contributions, notably for low income workers with full-time earnings, 
should be a priority. Such a step should be placed in the context of a broader reform to make the tax system 
more conducive to economic growth. In particular this involves continued efforts to reduce the tax burden 
on labour income, especially for workers on low pay. Such a reform should also include measures on the 
expenditure side of the social security system. More revenues could be raised from taxes on consumption, 
real estate and environmentally harmful behaviour, as suggested in the 2012 Economic Survey of Germany. 52. 
Some sources of capital income benefit from preferential tax treatment. Households' capital 
income (interest payments, dividends) is generally taxed at a rate of 26.4% at the household level, although 
households' interest income benefits from a tax-free allowance up to EUR 801. The general tax rate for 
capital income is, in many cases, below the marginal income tax households pay on their other income, as 
capital income is particularly concentrated among high-income households. These reduced tax rates have 
in the past helped to reduce tax evasion through capital flight. However, efforts have been made to improve 
international cooperation to prevent tax fraud. A moderate increase in capital income taxation may 
therefore not lead to more tax evasion (Bach and Beznoska, 2012b). Consideration should be given to align 
the taxation of capital income to the taxation of other personal income. Moreover, households are fully 
exempt from capital gains tax on housing property, held for more than 10 years, even if the owner does not 
live in the dwelling concerned. This tax exemption risks biasing investment decision towards residential 
housing, especially in the current low interest rate environment which may encourage expectations of 
rising prices and benefits high-wealth households the most (Frick and Grabka, 2009; Deutsche 
Bundesbank, 2013; European Central Bank, 2013). Realised capital gains on housing should be taxed, 
except for owner-occupied housing. 53. 
Inheritance taxes have less distortionary effects and entail a lower administrative burden than 
other forms of taxation of wealth (Bach and Beznoska, 2012a). There is scope to further increase revenues 
from inheritance taxes by removing exemptions. Wealth held in small and medium sized enterprises is ECO/WKP(2014)71 28 subject to lower inheritance taxation than other forms of wealth under certain conditions. Households 
therefore have incentives to transform private into business property to lower their tax burden (Bach and 
Beznoska, 2012b). The conditions for such transformations have recently been tightened. The remaining 
tax advantages provided to small firms in inheritance taxation should be reconsidered. To avoid liquidity 
problems for businesses subject to inheritance tax, tax payments can already be stretched over ten years. 
During this period, the tax liability could be subordinated to other claims on the business (see e.g. the 2004 
Economic Survey of Germany). Regional pockets of poverty risk could be addressed more effectively 54. 
Although dispersion of GDP per capita across Länder continued to decline over the past decade 
and is now lower in Germany than in most other EU countries, the risk of relative poverty has risen to a 
considerably higher level in East than in West Germany and continues to diverge (Grabka et al., 2012). 55. 
The current revenue-sharing system including fiscal federal transfers is based on population as 
well as on multipliers which only reflect differences in population density (Söllner, 2001). Although, 
additional discretionary transfers exist, in part to account for differences in long-term unemployment rates, 
they do not take into account additional socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as migrant 
status, or age composition, in the population structure across the Länder, which contribute to different 
levels of demand for public services provided by Länder and municipalities on their territory (Feld et al., 
2013; Heinemann, 2012). It should be considered to enlarge the set of criteria based on which transfers are 
provided, e.g. by including differences in age composition, socio-economic or migrant background. The 
advantage of including such demographic indicators in the determination of fiscal federal transfers is that 
they can help align such transfers with demand for social services more effectively without harming 
incentives of the poorest jurisdictions to strengthen their growth potential (Joumard and Kongsrud, 2003). 56. 
Subnational government levels may also face disincentives to provide adequate provision for key 
services that can help to boost inclusive economic growth. For example, municipalities may not fully take 
into account the benefits provided by childcare facilities and early childhood education, for which they 
have funding responsibilities, because they partly accrue to neighbouring jurisdictions or even nation-wide. 
Special grants from state to local governments are available to address such externalities. However they are 
provided on a discretionary basis with rules (for local grants) differing considerably across the Länder 
(Dombert, 2006). The government should consider assuming funding responsibilities for key social 
services provided by subnational governments subject to geographic externalities, which are particularly 
important for inclusive growth. For example, the federal government could finance vouchers for families 
with young children which they could use to pay for the services of accredited childcare facilities. ECO/WKP(2014)71 29 Box 6. Recommendations to foster inclusive growth Labour market  Continue to expand early childcare provision, notably for full-day care. Ensure equal access of the most vulnerable to affordable high-quality childcare independently of their place of residence and socio-economic 
background. Extend the supply of all-day schools.  Reduce the gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary workers by reducing protection of permanent workers and by limiting the use of multiple successive fixed term contracts with the 
same employee.  Introduce a general minimum wage at a sufficiently low level that will not lead to job losses, determined by an expert commission. Cautious use should be made of higher sectoral minimum wages set on the basis of 
collective agreements.  Target the preferential tax treatment of minijobs towards low-wage workers.  Make active labour market policies more targeted by monitoring self-selection problems within target groups. Continue to review in-work benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable receive sufficient support 
while minimising disincentives to work. For instance, phase out more slowly means-tested subsistence 
benefits for particularly vulnerable individuals earning more than EUR 100. Also phase out additional child 
benefits paid to parents receiving a housing allowance more slowly. Education  Reduce stratification of the school system and provide more financial resources to schools with a comparatively high share of pupils with weak socio-economic background. Reduce grade repetitions. 
Provide more support for disadvantaged youth to complete formal upper secondary education programmes, 
in particular mainstream VET. Continue reducing the assignment of pupils to special needs schools and 
make sure assignment to such schools does not reflect the socio-economic background of pupils.  Improve the quality of early childhood education and care, including by improving the staff-child ratio in accredited facilities; by better integrating education and care; and by ensuring early childhood professionals 
have better qualifications, more professional development opportunities and better working conditions. Tax and transfer system  Extend compulsory pensions to the self-employed.  Focus additional pension entitlements on reducing future old age poverty risks, for example, by phasing out subsistence benefit entitlements more slowly as pension entitlements rise.  Fund such additional spending from general tax revenue instead of higher payroll taxes. Strengthen incentives to retire later.  Extend capital gains taxes on residential real estate except for owner-occupied housing. Raise the tax rates applying to household capital income towards marginal income tax rates applying to other household 
income.  Equalize the inheritance tax burden for different forms of wealth.  Further improve the determination of risk-adjusted transfers within the health fund, by considering a larger number of diseases and by ensuring that transfers for higher age groups and diseases with high death tolls 
are high enough. ECO/WKP(2014)71 30 BIBLIOGRAPHY Acemoglu, D. and J.S. Pischke (2001),  " Minimum Wages and On-the-Job Training " , IZA Discussion
