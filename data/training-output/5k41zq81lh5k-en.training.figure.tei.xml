            <figDesc>employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. This analysis was<lb/> undertaken using decomposition techniques. With this approach, we split out the change in the<lb/> unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 into the proportion due to i) changes<lb/> in the composition of the youth unemployed population (e.g. if there are more unemployed youths with<lb/> higher levels of schooling), which is known as the &apos;Endowment Effect&apos;; ii) changes in the labour market<lb/> returns to possessing certain characteristics over time (e.g. changes in the marginal impact of<lb/> characteristics on the probability of a transition to employment in 2011 relative to 2006), which is known<lb/> as the &apos;Coefficient Effect&apos;; and iii) an unexplained effect, which is due to unobserved factors that are not<lb/> observed in the QNHS longitudinal data. Given that our dependent variable is a dichotomous 0/1 variable,<lb/> we estimated non-linear decomposition models: i) the Fairlie model, which produces an overall<lb/> endowment effect, ii) the Non-linear decompose model<lb/> 10 , which gives overall endowment and coefficient<lb/> effects, and iii) the Oaxaca decomposition, which produces overall endowment and coefficient effects and<lb/> also a breakdown for each individual variable.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>presents the profile of youths who were unemployed in Q2 2006 and 2011 according to their<lb/> subsequent labour market status, i.e. remained continuously unemployed between Q2 2006 (2011) and Q4<lb/> 2006 (2011) or transitioned into employment.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>gives a breakdown of the individual coefficient results; specifically, it lists what the main<lb/> drivers are in explaining the change in the transition rate between 2006 and 2011, which we were able to<lb/> account for in our models. On the one hand, we can see from this table that relative to possessing a Junior<lb/> Certificate qualification, having either a Leaving Certificate or PLC level qualification had a depreciating<lb/> effect on the unemployment-to-employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011. Having previous<lb/> unemployment duration of 7 to 12 months, relative to those with previous unemployment duration of 1 to<lb/> 3 months, also had a depreciating effect on the transition rate. On the other hand, possessing a third-level<lb/> qualification (Non-Degree or Degree or Higher) had an appreciating effecting on the unemployment to<lb/> employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011, as did being Irish, aged 15 to 19 and having a previous<lb/> unemployment duration of 13 months and above<lb/> 12 . Overall, our results indicate that the relative fall in the<lb/> unemployment to employment transition rate between 2006 and 2011 is not due to changes in the<lb/> population structure of unemployed young people, but to changes in external factors that have had an<lb/> impact on possessing certain characteristics. These are likely to reflect the impact of the recession.</figDesc>
