			<head>.......... 18<lb/> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> This paper discusses how social disadvantage affects the learning experiences of households with<lb/> fewer economic resources, at each stage of the individuals&apos; life-course, and on some of the &quot;social&quot; effects<lb/> of such learning. It argues that while education can be an escalator out of social disadvantage — leading to<lb/> better job prospects for youths facing greater risks of poverty and reducing the prevalence of income<lb/> poverty in adult age — educational failure can reinforce it: a significant minority of students in several<lb/> OECD countries do not even complete compulsory education; students&apos; test scores in lower secondary<lb/> education are strongly shaped by family characteristics; and the expansion of university education has most<lb/> often benefited households with better educated parents. Far from &quot;equalising&quot; opportunities, education can<lb/> be a powerful driver of social selection. When returns to education increase over time, this may lead to<lb/> greater inter-generational persistence of poverty and less equality of opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> The paper discusses the role of policies that pay special attention to the learning experiences of<lb/> individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, as part of a broader strategy to fight poverty and social<lb/> exclusion. These policies fall into two main categories:<lb/> • Educational policies. These policies can be designed with the aim of offsetting some key aspects<lb/> of family disadvantage that hold back educational achievement, and these policies do not<lb/> necessarily hold back students&apos; achievement at the higher end of the proficiency scale. Some<lb/> OECD countries have much more equitable policies regulating school admission than others, and<lb/> sorting of students by proficiency levels occurs at a later age. Interventions that aim to bolster<lb/> both cognitive and non-cognitive skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds can play an<lb/> important role in limiting social exclusion and facilitating the task of social policies at a later<lb/> stage of the individuals&apos; life-course.<lb/> • Social policies. These policies can be designed so as to strengthen their learning content.<lb/> Emphasis is here placed on policies that offer cash transfers to families with children that are<lb/> conditional on sending children to school; learning programmes targeted at youths who dropped<lb/> out of formal schools; adult training targeted to individuals with lower educational attainment;<lb/> policies that provide recognition for competences learned on-the-job; as well as programmes that<lb/> aim to alter parental attitudes to education (e.g. parenting programmes) or that offer out-of-school<lb/> programmes that can influence peer groups of children.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> A crucial feature when designing programmes focused on the learning experiences of individuals<lb/> is their timing. Over the years, a substantial body of evidence has accumulated that testifies to the<lb/> importance of programmes targeted to pre-school children from disadvantaged background. This is less<lb/> agreement on the effects of programmes targeting disadvantaged individuals in a later stage of their life-<lb/>course. The paper reviews evidence from three such programmes: school based programmes targeting<lb/> disadvantaged students, financial support and &apos;mentoring&apos; provided to disadvantaged students, and<lb/> programmes for adults and high-school drop-outs. Evidence from programme evaluations suggests that<lb/> such programmes can improve both employment and earnings prospects of individuals from poor families<lb/> when they are properly designed, well-targeted, adequately financed, and monitored through appropriate<lb/> evaluation strategies.<lb/></p>

			<head>RÉSUME<lb/></head>

			<table>4.<lb/> Ce document présente une analyse de la relation entre désavantage social et parcours éducatifs<lb/> des individus issus d&apos;un milieu familial défavorisé à chaque étape de leur vie, et décrit certaines des<lb/> conséquences de ces parcours pour la société dans son ensemble. Une conclusion générale est que si la<lb/> formation peut servir d&apos;ascenseur social –– en offrant de meilleures perspectives d&apos;emploi aux jeunes les<lb/> plus menacés de dénuement et en réduisant la prévalence de la pauvreté économique à l&apos;âge adulte ––<lb/> l&apos;échec scolaire peut en revanche renforcer le désavantage social : dans plusieurs pays de l&apos;OCDE, une<lb/> minorité importante d&apos;élèves n&apos;arrive même pas au terme de l&apos;enseignement obligatoire ; dans le premier<lb/> cycle du secondaire, les résultats des élèves aux tests dépendent beaucoup des caractéristiques de la<lb/> famille ; et le développement des études universitaires a le plus souvent profité aux ménages dont les<lb/> parents étaient relativement mieux instruits. Loin d&apos; « égaliser » les chances, l&apos;éducation peut être un<lb/> puissant moteur de sélection sociale. Dans un contexte où le rendement de la formation augmente avec le<lb/> temps, cette dynamique pourrait conduire à une persistance de la pauvreté de génération en génération plus<lb/> accentuée ainsi qu&apos;une diminution de l&apos;égalité des chances.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Ce rapport analyse aussi le rôle des politiques qui sont plus particulièrement axées sur les<lb/> parcours d&apos;apprentissage des personnes issues des milieux défavorisés, dans le cadre d&apos;une stratégie plus<lb/> vaste de lutte contre la pauvreté et l&apos;exclusion sociale. Ces mesures peuvent être groupées dans deux<lb/> grandes catégories:<lb/> • Les politiques d&apos;éducation. Ces politiques peuvent être conçues dans le but de compenser<lb/> certains aspects essentiels des désavantages dus au milieu familial, qui freinent la réussite<lb/> scolaire, sans pour autant nécessairement entraver celle des meilleurs élèves. Dans certains pays<lb/> de l&apos;OCDE, les règles d&apos;admission à l&apos;école sont beaucoup plus équitables que dans d&apos;autres et la<lb/> répartition des élèves par niveau de compétence se fait à un âge ultérieur. Les mesures destinées à<lb/> renforcer les compétences à la fois cognitives et non cognitives des élèves issus des milieux<lb/> défavorisés peuvent jouer un rôle important en limitant l&apos;exclusion sociale et en atténuant le<lb/> recours à des mesures sociales à un stade ultérieur de la vie des intéressés.<lb/> • Les politiques sociales. Ces politiques peuvent dans leur conception avoir un contenu formation<lb/> plus important. Sont en l&apos;occurrence privilégiés : les politiques qui prévoient l&apos;octroi de<lb/> ressources financières aux familles à la condition que ces dernières envoient leurs enfants à<lb/> l&apos;école ; les programmes de formation ciblés sur les jeunes sortis prématurément du circuit<lb/> scolaire ordinaire ; la formation pour adultes ciblée sur les individus ayant un faible niveau<lb/> d&apos;instruction ; les politiques de validation des acquis professionnels ; ainsi que les programmes<lb/> dont l&apos;objet est de modifier l&apos;attitude des parents à l&apos;égard des études (programmes de formation<lb/> à l&apos;art d&apos;être parents, par exemple) ou qui proposent des activités extra-scolaires, pouvant exercer<lb/> une influence sur des groupes d&apos;enfants du même âge.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Un aspect essentiel des programmes axés sur les parcours d&apos;apprentissage est le stade de la vie<lb/> auquel ils sont mis en oeuvre. Au fil des ans, on a accumulé une masse considérable de données qui<lb/> témoignent de l&apos;importance de cibler les programmes sur les enfants issus des milieux défavorisés dès la<lb/> préscolarisation. Il y a moins d&apos;accord pour ce qui est des effets des programmes ciblés sur des personnes<lb/> défavorisées à un stade ultérieur de leur vie. Ce document passe en revue des données factuelles<lb/> concernant trois types de programmes : les programmes mis en oeuvre dans les établissements scolaires en<lb/> faveur des élèves défavorisés ; les aides financières et le mentorat assurés à ces élèves ; et les programmes<lb/> pour les adultes et les personnes qui ont abandonné leurs études dans le deuxième cycle du secondaire. Les<lb/> évaluations disponibles suggèrent que lorsque ces programmes sont correctement conçus, bien ciblés,<lb/> adéquatement financés et suivis grâce à des stratégies appropriées d&apos;évaluation, ils peuvent améliorer à la<lb/> fois l&apos;emploi et les perspectives de gains des personnes issues de familles démunies.<lb/> SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE<lb/> AND EDUCATION EXPERIENCES<lb/></table>

			<head>I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>7.<lb/> Education is a key driver of economic and social success for individuals, employers and nations.<lb/> Writers in many disciplines have noted that education can enhance social welfare, impact upon economic<lb/> growth and be a key factor in the design and implementation of economic and social policy. In many<lb/> quarters education is believed to offer a route where people can escape from disadvantaged family<lb/> backgrounds and climb the social ladder. There are, in short, social benefits of learning beyond the<lb/> economic ones that accrue to each individual (Box 1).<lb/> 8.<lb/> However, education experiences remain strongly associated with social disadvantage. In many<lb/> countries there are large numbers of people with very low education levels whose family origins were<lb/> impoverished and characterised by disadvantage. Whilst education can break such intergenerational cycles<lb/> of disadvantage, it can also act to reinforce them: for example, if education policy is not designed with<lb/> egalitarian notions in mind. This is one of the reasons why the ability of education to operate as a<lb/> mechanism with the potential to offset social disadvantage is important.<lb/> 9.<lb/> Empirical evidence from studies conducted by social scientists makes it clear that there is<lb/> significant scope for education to play a role in influencing the economic and social situations of people. In<lb/> cross-country comparisons of education and economic growth, formal schooling plays an important role in<lb/> enhancing economic growth (<ref type="biblio">Barro, 1997, Barro and Lee, 1993, and Krueger and Lindahl, 2001</ref>).<lb/> Education has been shown to significantly raise labour market earnings and employment probabilities<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Card, 1999</ref>) and to significantly impact upon health (<ref type="biblio">Currie, 1995</ref>), crime (<ref type="biblio">Lochner and Moretti, 2004</ref>)<lb/> and a range of other social capital outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Hammond and Feinstein, 2004</ref>).<lb/> 10.<lb/> Most of this work concerns itself with the &apos;average&apos; effects of education. For example, by how<lb/> much more does a country&apos;s GDP grow if average years of schooling rise? Or by how much on average do<lb/> earnings rise for another year of schooling? There is a lot of evidence in this vein in a very rich and highly<lb/> developed empirical literature. There is more limited research looking at the experience of disadvantaged<lb/> groups. I consider both sets of evidence in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 1. OECD work on the &quot;social outcomes of learning&quot;<lb/></figure>

			<p>A large body of empirical literature has looked at the economic returns that investments in education bring to<lb/> individuals. Such returns are, however, only part of the bigger picture. In addition to economic returns (in the form of<lb/> labour market advantage), learning experiences — both in and outside school setting — bring other types of benefits.<lb/> Some of these benefits accrue to individuals, as in the case of better health conditions; others may affect the broader<lb/> community in which individuals live, as in the case of better parenting practices, greater involvement in community life<lb/> and lower crime. For the purpose of better identifying and measuring these effects, the OECD Centre of Educational<lb/> Research and Innovation launched in 2004 a project on the &quot;Social Outcomes of Learning&quot;. This paper contributes to<lb/> this project as part of the broader OECD work on resource distribution&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are two main reasons why discussions about the &quot;social outcomes of learning&quot; are of direct interest to the<lb/> social policy community in OECD countries:<lb/> • First is the attention recently given to the notion of &quot;active social policies&quot;. Such notion — which featured<lb/> prominently at the April 2005 meeting of OECD social policy ministers — emphasises the importance of<lb/> shifting from a remedial approach in social policy to one that privileges the goals of &apos;making work pay&apos; and of<lb/> facilitating people&apos;s integration into the labour market. This shift of emphasis calls for greater attention to<lb/> those learning experiences that can either enhance or hamper the employment and career prospects of<lb/> individuals at greater risk of social exclusion. The more social policy makers pitch their strategies to<lb/> &apos;integration into the labour market&apos;, the less they can afford to ignore how learning shapes the labour market<lb/> outcomes of poor people.<lb/> • The second reason for investigating the social outcomes of learning relates to the traditional goal of social<lb/> justice embedded in most social programmes. While, traditionally, these programmes have focused on<lb/> measures of income poverty and inequality at a given point in time, growing attention is being paid today to<lb/> the inter-generational transmission of such inequalities. The existence of such transmission has implications<lb/> for both social justice and for economic efficiency, to the extent that able and motivated youths from<lb/> disadvantaged backgrounds may be denied the opportunities provided by a modern market economy.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Because the existing empirical literature is less focused upon the scope for education to offset<lb/> social disadvantage, it is worthwhile organizing the discussion into a two-stage process. There are large<lb/> bodies of evidence first on how disadvantage affects learning experiences and second on how learning<lb/> experiences affect outcomes in adulthood. It is the combination of the two links (in a world where the<lb/> economic or social premium to education is increasing over time) that may worsen the conditions of those<lb/> from disadvantaged families. Because of this, I motivate my discussion of the evidence by appealing to this<lb/> life-course, or sequential, approach which splits the impact of education into a two-stage process: first, the<lb/> impact of disadvantage on education over the life-course; second, the impact of education on adult<lb/> economic and social outcomes. Even if both of these are &apos;average&apos; effects, this sequential approach still tells<lb/> us about the role education can play as a transmission mechanism.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Because educational experiences and achievement are increasingly important in shaping people&apos;s<lb/> life chances, especially their ability to get a good job offering a decent career, this has significant<lb/> implications for social policies in many OECD countries. The increased focus of active social policies on<lb/> &apos;making work pay&apos; and integrating people into the labour market, coupled with education mattering more,<lb/> means that governments need to focus more on education and education policy, to make sure that a group<lb/> of disadvantaged individuals are not left behind. How the evidence on education and social disadvantage<lb/> links to this policy debate will also be considered in this paper.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Discussing the evidence on the impact of education, and linking it to an appropriate policy<lb/> perspective, is a highly challenging and important task. This is the aim of this paper, which is structured as<lb/> follows. Section II discusses the evidence on how educational experiences are related to social<lb/> disadvantage and other family characteristics. Section III considers research findings on the impact of<lb/> education on economic and social outcomes in adult life. Section IV places the discussion into its<lb/> appropriate policy perspective, together with a discussion of evidence from education evaluations, whilst<lb/> Section V concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>II.<lb/> Education and social disadvantage over the life-course<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> Education is linked to various dimensions of social disadvantage throughout an individual&apos;s life<lb/> span. This includes their time in pre-primary education, in the compulsory schooling system during their<lb/> childhood years, as young adults in post-compulsory education and during the years of adulthood. In this<lb/> Section I consider empirical evidence on the connections between education and social disadvantage for<lb/> each of these life phases in turn. The aim of this section is to discuss and summarise the evidence on how<lb/> different dimensions of social disadvantage shape learning experiences during the life-course.<lb/> 15.<lb/> Much of the work in this area draws upon longitudinal data sources that follow children as they<lb/> grow up and collect various data on their educational skills and experiences in these years, but also<lb/> information on their parents and area where they were raised. The usual approach is to present findings<lb/> from statistical regressions that relate measures of education to the disadvantage indicator of interest whilst<lb/> controlling for other relevant factors. This research approach then shows the average links between<lb/> education and disadvantage. Somewhat less common, though highly appealing from a research<lb/> methodology perspective, is to assign children or adults to particular learning programmes (either through<lb/> randomized controls, or through quasi-experimental routes offered by policy changes): this approach<lb/> allows to carry out comparisons of affected individuals as compared to those not affected to deduce the<lb/> impact on economic and social outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Early childhood education<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Gaps in cognitive and non-cognitive skills arise before children go to school. A huge, and<lb/> sometimes contentious, research literature looks at many of the links between early child development and<lb/> social disadvantage. Recognition of the importance of this connection is confirmed by the existence of<lb/> active policies like Head Start in the United States or Sure Start in the United Kingdom, which are<lb/> designed to level the playing field at or near school entry age for children from less privileged<lb/> backgrounds.<lb/> 17.<lb/> Much of the work by economists and social policy researchers relates early age test scores of<lb/> children to family background and uncovers important correlations. Some of the work, like that on early<lb/> childhood programmes like Head Start (see the discussion in <ref type="biblio">Currie, 2001</ref>), is of an experimental nature in<lb/> that some children participate in a programme whereas others do not. The analysis thus compares a<lb/> &apos;treatment&apos; group (those in the programme) with a &apos;control&apos; group (those not in the programme) to evaluate<lb/> the impact of the programme.<lb/> 18.<lb/> It is clear from this literature that test score gaps emerge across children from different family<lb/> backgrounds at early ages. For example, a recent review by <ref type="biblio">Meyers et al. (2004)</ref> documents sizable<lb/> disparities in pre-school enrolment between children from high and low education parental backgrounds.<lb/> Evidence shows that early childhood education programs narrow test score gaps between ethnic minority<lb/> children and whites in the United States (<ref type="biblio">Currie, 2001</ref>); and that attendance at pre-school confers a<lb/> cognitive advantage on children before they enter school (see <ref type="biblio">Magnusson et al. 2004</ref>, for the United <ref type="biblio">States<lb/> and Sammons et al. 2002</ref>, for the United Kingdom).<lb/> 19.<lb/> The observation that a significant amount of inequality of cognitive and non-cognitive skills can<lb/> be tracked to the early years, and that these early age skills are key drivers of subsequent economic and<lb/> social success or failure, makes some conclude that this is the time and place where education interventions<lb/> need to occur. See, among others, a strong statement of this nature from Heckman and Wax (2004) who<lb/> state: &quot;Like it or not, the most important mental and behavioural patterns, once established, are difficult to<lb/> change once children enter school&quot;. The argument is that there is a higher return to investments made in the<lb/> early years, as compared to later on in the life course. This is controversial, and will be partly discussed in<lb/> the policy section below. One important issue is whether gains from early interventions persist or tend to<lb/> decay if not supplemented by further measures, and this is an issue that remains far from resolved.<lb/> However, at this juncture, the key point to take away is that there exist significant gaps in cognitive and<lb/> non-cognitive skills that arise even before school, that the gaps are strongly linked to social disadvantage<lb/> and family background, and that &apos;quality&apos; early childhood education may play a role in narrowing them.<lb/></p>

			<head>Compulsory education<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> The test score gaps evident in the early years continue to develop and widen in the school years.<lb/> In academic work and in the policy arena the links between education experiences and measures of<lb/> childhood disadvantage have long been recognised. Empirical research on education and social<lb/> disadvantage has often linked observable measures of educational achievement to various aspects of<lb/> disadvantage. These include (among others): child poverty; parental education and income; parental<lb/> attitudes; neighbourhood factors. There is a by now sizable body of evidence (<ref type="biblio">Currie, 1995; Gregg and<lb/> Machin, 1999, 2001</ref>) that educational achievement is significantly lower for children from disadvantaged<lb/> backgrounds. This includes a higher probability of dropping out of school, lower qualification attainment<lb/> and lower test scores at various ages through the school years. These gaps are present even in studies that<lb/> condition on the early age (pre-school or at or near school starting ages) test scores of children.<lb/> 21.<lb/> There is a lot of evidence showing that children from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds do<lb/> worse in terms of educational attainment through the school years or in terms of education levels achieved<lb/> at the compulsory school-leaving age. Much of this comes from studies based upon single countries.<lb/> However, with some of the data sources on international test scores of school-age children one can draw<lb/> some international comparisons to illustrate the almost universal strong links between pupil achievement<lb/> and family background. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows family background effects on test scores from an interesting recent<lb/> paper by Schuetz, Ursrpung and <ref type="biblio">Woessman (2005)</ref>. This uses cross-country data from the Third<lb/> International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) from 1995 and its repeat survey from 1999. In 53<lb/> out of 54 countries the family background effect is statistically significant and the implied gaps in test<lb/> scores are large. Moreover, the estimates are internationally comparable and show very large family<lb/> background effects in some countries. The largest family background effects are in England and, whilst all<lb/> show an important family background gradient, there is a fairly wide range of estimates (and the relative<lb/> positions may be sensitive to the use of TIMSS data as compared to other survey data on pupil<lb/> achievement).<lb/></p>

			<p>Note. Family background effects are based on reported measures of the number of books at home; test scores are<lb/> average maths and science scores from TIMSS. The family background effects are estimated from statistical<lb/> regressions explaining standardised test scores based on the number of books at home. As standardised test scores<lb/> have an international standard deviation of 100, these effects can be interpreted as percentages of an international<lb/> standard deviation by which test achievement increases if the number of books is raised by one category. The authors<lb/> validate these estimates by also looking at other measures of family background from the 2001 Progress in<lb/> International Reading Literacy Survey (PIRLS).<lb/></p>

			<p>22.<lb/> A recent interesting strand of work in this area focuses on non-cognitive skills (like social skills<lb/> and motivation) and their role in affecting education and life chances. A body of work by Heckman and<lb/> colleagues (<ref type="biblio">Carneiro and Heckman, 2003, Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001, Heckman and Vtylacil, 2001</ref>)<lb/> has shown that better non-cognitive skills, including many developed in the early years of life, also lead to<lb/> improved educational outcomes. This confirms that the better development of cognitive and non-cognitive<lb/> skills has scope to enhance educational performances.<lb/></p>

			<head>Post-compulsory education<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> Social disadvantage also matters for the phase of post-compulsory education, where it is evident<lb/> that educational inequalities linked to family background tend to persist and become larger (<ref type="biblio">Feinstein,<lb/> 2004</ref>). The likelihood of staying on after the compulsory school-leaving age is linked to family background<lb/> and social disadvantage in many countries. Since participation in higher education enhances life chances<lb/> and success as an adult, this compounds the already wide inequalities linked to social disadvantage that<lb/> arise in the childhood years.<lb/> 24.<lb/> There are a range of issues pertaining to the way in which social disadvantage lowers the<lb/> probability of participating in higher education (or pushes people from such backgrounds into the lower<lb/> quality end of the spectrum). Work looking at participation in higher education, or more specifically<lb/> university attendance, has shown that people from lower income backgrounds have significantly lower<lb/> participation rates (two recent example are <ref type="biblio">Blanden and Gregg, 2004</ref>, for the United Kingdom; and <ref type="biblio">Black<lb/> and Sufi, 2002</ref>, for the United States). Whilst there are problems of comparability across countries, owing<lb/> to data differences and to the different nature of higher education systems, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows difference in<lb/> participation in tertiary education by parents&apos; level of education for a range of countries. In all of them<lb/> there are sizable gaps between participation rates of those from families with parents who themselves have<lb/> tertiary levels of education as compared to parents with lower education levels.<lb/></p>

			<p>25.<lb/> The other feature of post-compulsory education and its connection to social disadvantage is that<lb/> people from poorer backgrounds who do participate tend to enrol on courses, or in institutions, that yield<lb/> lower economic and social benefits. This includes a lower likelihood of studying at &quot; elite &quot; universities<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Chevalier and Conlon, 2003</ref>) and also a higher probability of studying for a vocational qualification rather<lb/> than an academic qualification (<ref type="biblio">Conlon, 2002</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>26.<lb/> Social disadvantages experienced earlier in life also impact strongly on adult life chances<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bynner and Feinstein, 2004</ref>). This is clearly bad for them and for national prosperity, and research has<lb/> shown that education is an important factor in explaining why these basic skills deficiencies arise.<lb/> Studying the characteristics of the low basic skills group amongst the adult population shows them to very<lb/> clearly be those who left the school system at the compulsory school-leaving age, who typically have no<lb/> educational qualifications, and who come from poorer and more disadvantaged social backgrounds.<lb/> 27.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows rates of attendance in adult education by educational attainment. Participation<lb/> rates are higher in all countries for the most educated. The lifelong learning process evidently is biased<lb/> towards those that already have more education, and this has a reinforcing effect on the educational<lb/> inequalities. Without exception, even in the Scandinavian countries where the adult education and training<lb/> gap is narrower by education group, there seems less scope to alleviate problems linked to low educational<lb/> levels and/or poor basic skills that emerge from the adult education system.<lb/></p>

			<p>28.<lb/> The persistence of these skills problems through adult life is not only bad news for the<lb/> individuals concerned (in terms of unemployment, deprivation and so on) but also for their families, their<lb/> children&apos;s educational performance and for the communities in which they live. Social disadvantage<lb/> clearly has much wider and far-reaching implications since cycles of disadvantage can run across<lb/> generations and through families and communities. The fact that education is so inherently connected to<lb/> social disadvantage makes the scope for social policy that affects educational opportunities all the more<lb/> important, even if their specific features should reflect the relative importance of the various factors that<lb/> lead poor households to &apos;under-invest&apos; in education (Box 2).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Reasons why the poor do not invest in education<lb/></head>

			<p>The interpretation of education gaps by family background has received a lot of research attention. A sizable, and<lb/> often contentious, debate has considered whether family income in itself matters, or whether one can attribute lower<lb/> education levels and post-compulsory participation to other factors of disadvantage (like those acquired much earlier<lb/> on in life). For example, some authors (like <ref type="biblio">Mayer, 1997</ref>) argue that it is not income per se that directly affects<lb/> children&apos;s life chances, but rather the factors that cause parents to have low incomes. Whether this is the case, or that<lb/> income does matter, it remains the case that one sees lower participation in higher education from people who grew up<lb/> in a poorer, or more disadvantaged, family environment. This is therefore an important issue for social policy, although<lb/> which view is more correct of course matters when thinking about an appropriate policy response.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lower levels of access to tertiary education have also been linked to the presence of family credit constraints, to<lb/> different rates of time preference amongst people from different family backgrounds and to differing attitudes to debt.<lb/> These are all factors that link to social disadvantage and unravelling their relative importance in explaining lower<lb/> access and participation is not straightforward on the basis of existing empirical evidence. But all are issues that need<lb/> to be considered, especially when considering policy options.<lb/></p>

			<head>III.<lb/> Impact of education on economic and social outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>29.<lb/> A large body of research over the years has studied the impact of education on a range of<lb/> economic and social outcomes in adulthood. Amongst economists the principal focus has been on the way<lb/> that education is valued in the labour market, especially in terms of the wage returns that accrue to higher<lb/> education levels. This originates in the path-breaking work on human capital from the 1960s and 1970s<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Becker, 1964</ref>) which developed an analytical framework explaining why individuals invest in education<lb/> and training in a manner analogous to firms&apos; investment in physical capital. Other social scientists have<lb/> considered wider benefits from education, with particular focus placed on the connections between<lb/> education and outcomes like health, crime and civic participation and engagement, often in the context of a<lb/> wider agenda on social capital (with origins developed in <ref type="biblio">Coleman, 1988, Putnam et al., 1993, and<lb/> Fukuyama, 1995</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Labour market outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>30.<lb/> It is now well established that education is closely connected to better labour market outcomes. In<lb/> economic terms, an individual&apos;s decision to invest more in education generally yields a positive and<lb/> significant return to that investment (<ref type="biblio">Becker, 1964, Mincer, 1974</ref>). This is, of course, a return that is<lb/> private to the individual making the investment.<lb/> 31.<lb/> There is by now a lot of evidence that there are significant wage and employment returns to<lb/> education. There is also evidence that the advantage provided by education has been increasing over time<lb/> (at least in the recent past – in other periods, like the 1970s, the wage advantage from higher education<lb/> actually fell in the face of rapid supply increases). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, reproduced from the 2005 OECD Education at<lb/> a Glance, shows sizable wage differentials between those with a university degree as compared to those<lb/> with upper secondary or post-secondary education levels. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the employment rates of graduates<lb/> to be significantly higher than for non-graduates for a range of countries. Moreover, the labour market<lb/> advantages of graduates are also improving over time: earnings differentials of persons aged 25-to-64 with<lb/> tertiary education (relative to those of persons with upper secondary education) improved, on average, by<lb/> around 3% in the four years to 2002, while earnings of persons with less than upper secondary education<lb/> were stable or declining in a majority of OECD countries (OECD, 2005).<lb/></p>

			<p>There are some important issues of interpretation surrounding these labour market differentials.<lb/> The empirical literature on the private wage returns to education is one of the largest areas of empirical<lb/> microeconomics. Because of this, various issues of modelling and measurement are well understood. 1 One<lb/> of the critical issues raised in this work is the need to ensure that there is a causal impact of education on<lb/> wages so as to ensure it is education that matters in generating a &apos;true&apos; return. It is important to understand<lb/> the difference between the causal effect of education and simple correlations between education levels and<lb/> wages (like those in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). As Blundell et al. put it, there is a need to &quot;distinguish between<lb/> the higher earnings that are observed for better-educated workers being caused by their higher education<lb/> and individuals with greater earning capacity choosing to acquire more education&quot; (<ref type="biblio">Blundell et al., 2005</ref>).<lb/> 1.<lb/> Very good reviews and evidence covering these issues are given in Card (1999) and in <ref type="biblio">Blundell et al. (2000,<lb/> 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>33.<lb/> Various empirical strategies have been devised to identify the &apos;causal impact&apos; of education on<lb/> earnings and the approaches used are much better developed than in many other areas of empirical work in<lb/> the social sciences. 2 Existing evidence shows that there is indeed a sizable wage return to education. This is<lb/> true in studies set in different time periods, in different countries and for different demographic groups. Of<lb/> course, the estimated returns do differ with observable characteristics (e.g. returns to university degrees<lb/> vary according to university attended and subject studied), but there is clear evidence of a significant<lb/> 2.<lb/> Many of the methods are quite technical in nature, but the key feature is to ensure that one eliminates any<lb/> possibility of reverse causation running from education to wages. Of the strategies used, there have been<lb/> statistical methods to ensure education is an exogenous variable (these are known as instrumental variable, IV,<lb/> strategies), studies looking at twins and siblings so as to eliminate common family effects, and those that<lb/> exploit policy variations that raise people&apos;s education levels independent of their choices (e.g. raising of<lb/> compulsory school-leaving ages, again in an IV type approach).<lb/> positive wage return to education. This finding holds true when one adopts methods to ensure the direction<lb/> of causality runs from education to earnings and not the other way around. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> summarises some of the<lb/> key papers in the field: in all cases the &quot; causal &quot; impacts, where researchers try and ensure variations in<lb/> education are driven by factors that do not directly impact on wages, are above the &apos;basic&apos; uncorrected<lb/> differentials. Moreover, with few exceptions, the difference between the basic and causal returns is of<lb/> similar magnitudes for the studies considered in the Table (although they obviously differ across studies<lb/> owing to different data, different countries and so on). Hence, there is robust cross-country evidence that<lb/> the more educated get higher monetary rewards in the labour market.<lb/></p>

			<p>34.<lb/> The evidence discussed in Section II showed that education levels are significantly lower for<lb/> people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The fact that education raises earnings power in the labour<lb/> market thus shows how social disadvantage works through education to generate lower income for people<lb/> from less advantaged backgrounds. This is because people from disadvantaged backgrounds invest less in<lb/> education than other people do and thus fewer of them accrue the wage gains associated with such<lb/> investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social outcomes<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Returns to individuals in terms of higher wages are only one part of the story in which education<lb/> and social disadvantage interact to affect individuals&apos; livelihoods and well-being. Investment in education<lb/> can clearly impact on other outcomes, and generate externalities that can cause the private and social<lb/> returns to diverge from one another. One way of thinking about this is to consider the impact of education<lb/> on other non-wage economic and social outcomes.<lb/> 36.<lb/> Social science researchers have considered the wider benefits of education by studying<lb/> connections between education and outcomes like health, crime, civic engagement and intergenerational<lb/> effects on children&apos;s outcomes. There is evidence of important externalities, in that education significantly<lb/> improves health outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Grossman and Kaestner, 1997, Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973, Lleras-Muney,<lb/> 2005</ref>), is associated with lower crime levels (<ref type="biblio">Lochner and Moretti, 2004, Feinstein and Sabates, 2005,<lb/> Machin and Vujic, 2005</ref>) and enhances the extent of civic engagement and participation (<ref type="biblio">Brehm and Rahn,<lb/> 1997, Bynner and Egerton, 2001, Bynner and Parsons, 1997, Dee, 2004</ref>). Moreover, there are important<lb/> intergenerational effects of education of adults on the education of their children (Black, <ref type="biblio">Devereux and<lb/> Salvanes, 2005</ref>). Two examples of social effects of education are discussed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prevalence of income-poverty<lb/></head>

			<p>37.<lb/> How skills are distributed among the adult population can influence the prevalence and severity<lb/> of income poverty. Data from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) of 1995 show that countries<lb/> like the United Kingdom and the United States have very dense lower tails of the distribution of literacy<lb/> skills among adults (including amongst younger adults), whereas in Sweden and Germany hardly any<lb/> adults are at these low levels. These data also show that this is not a problem concentrated amongst older<lb/> adults, since very poor literacy and numeracy levels are present amongst 16-to-25-year-olds in the United<lb/> Kingdom and the United States. 3 Across the OECD area, countries where the &quot;tail&quot; in the distribution of<lb/> skills among the adult population is largest also tend to experience higher poverty rates in a point in time<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Intergenerational mobility<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> A small but ambitious body of work studies how children from different social backgrounds fare<lb/> as they progress through the school years. The focus is usually on the scope to escape from disadvantage.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Johnson and Reed (1996)</ref> look at cohort data from the British National Child Development Study (NCDS) 4<lb/> 3.<lb/> For example, 22% of 16-25 year olds in Britain have literacy levels below IALS Level 2, compared to 19% of<lb/> 36-45 year olds; comparable numbers for the United States are 26% for 16-25 year olds and 18% for 36-45<lb/> year olds. In Sweden 5% of 16-25 year olds are below Level 2, and in Germany the corresponding number is<lb/> 4%. The same pattern is true of numeracy skills. See OECD (1995).<lb/> 4.<lb/> NCDS is a birth cohort surveying all people born in a week of March 1958 at various ages (7, 11, 16 23, 33<lb/> and 42 at the time of writing).<lb/></table>

			<p>to study the relationship between sons and fathers and their position in the income distribution. They pay<lb/> particular attention to those who start or end up near the top or bottom of the distribution and find that<lb/> cohort members at these extreme ends of the distribution are particularly subject to immobility across the<lb/> generations. Whilst this shows the scope to escape from a low-income background to be limited, they also<lb/> show there to be a positive relationship between test scores at age seven and the likelihood of moving up<lb/> the distribution among those whose fathers are at the bottom of the distribution. Thus, better cognitive<lb/> skills, as measured by the NCDS test scores, are key to escaping, even at relatively early ages.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Other work has stressed that there are international differences in the extent of intergenerational<lb/> mobility of economic and social outcomes. Countries with higher levels of social mobility also have<lb/> education systems that seem to do better at ensuring educational equalities. Social mobility is higher in the<lb/> Scandinavian countries, at intermediate levels in Germany, and at its lowest in the United Kingdom and the<lb/> United States (<ref type="biblio">Solon, 2002</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows some recent estimates that try to ensure international<lb/> comparability in terms of the outcomes of interest and the samples used. The estimates relate sons&apos; earnings<lb/> to fathers&apos; earnings, where a higher partial correlation corresponds to a stronger cross-generation<lb/> dependence of sons&apos; earnings on fathers&apos; earnings, i.e. lower intergenerational mobility. The Table makes it<lb/> evident that countries with less intergenerational income mobility are also those identified earlier as being<lb/> characterised by sizable tails at the lower end of the distributions of literacy and numeracy skills.<lb/></p>

			<p>Changing patterns of education and income inequalities also have implications for future patterns<lb/> of social mobility. Indeed, evidence for the United Kingdom has shown that the combination of rapid<lb/> educational upgrading and increased returns to human capital over time has led to falling social mobility<lb/> (Blanden, <ref type="biblio">Gregg and Machin, 2005a, 2005b</ref>). When education expansion favours individuals from richer<lb/> family backgrounds (as in the United Kingdom, see <ref type="biblio">Blanden and Machin, 2004</ref>), this acts to reinforce<lb/> income persistence across generations and depress the prospects for social mobility. It is evident that this<lb/> has strong implications for the design and implementation of social policy.<lb/> 41.<lb/> To summarise, the existence of important effects of education on economic and social outcomes<lb/> strengthens what was said about the role of education, and its interaction with social disadvantage, in the<lb/> context of the private wage returns. If social disadvantages can be mediated and offset by improved<lb/> education, this can also generate wider benefits in terms of better health, crime and social capital outcomes,<lb/> together with potential intergenerational effects that can temper the deleterious effects resulting from cross-<lb/>generational cycles of disadvantage.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.<lb/> Policy perspective<lb/></head>

			<p>42.<lb/> The research findings discussed in the previous two sections have direct implications for the<lb/> design of education and social policy. The connections between education and life chances, and the myriad<lb/> of dimensions of social disadvantage, mean that one needs to gear a policy discussion towards aspects of<lb/> social policy that focus on education and towards aspects of educational policies that will impact on social<lb/> disadvantage in later life. More generally, it is important to focus on altering the extent of disadvantage<lb/> within society. Central to this is the links to policy interventions and how they have been evaluated by<lb/> social science researchers. In this respect, one needs to acknowledge that there are important, but often<lb/> complex, complementarities that characterise education and social policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Education policies<lb/></head>

			<p>43.<lb/> Considering longer term aspects of policy, it is evident that education policies can be designed<lb/> with an aim of offsetting the key aspects of family disadvantage that hold back educational achievement.<lb/> At what stage of the life-cycle such interventions are targeted and at what particular aspects of education<lb/> are important questions to be resolved. Similarly whether they are directed at formal types of learning, or at<lb/> non-formal types of learning, is important, though relatively under-studied.<lb/> 44.<lb/> Remedying disadvantages in access to better quality education – both at the compulsory and non-<lb/>compulsory stages of the education sequence, and indeed in the pre-school phase – can be rationalised for<lb/> reasons of both social justice and efficiency, if more able children from poorer backgrounds miss out due<lb/> to disadvantage. Given the evidence that educational achievement is strongly tied to both cognitive and<lb/> non-cognitive skills of children, this is in line with the notion that educational policy interventions can<lb/> enhance the life chances of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.<lb/> 45.<lb/> The question of timing is important. Indeed, social scientists from various disciplines (and of all<lb/> political persuasions) acknowledge that high payoffs can result from spending on early childhood<lb/> programs. Indeed some argue these are the only worthwhile interventions (e.g. Heckman&apos;s work argues<lb/> inequalities in skills attributable to social and family backgrounds are already established before children<lb/> enter school). But others argue that these payoffs decay rapidly unless bolstered with interventions that can<lb/> continually offset social disadvantages through the whole education sequence.<lb/> 46.<lb/> Comparing the somewhat narrower focus on benefits considered by economists with the wider<lb/> benefits from education that are considered in other social science disciplines leads to a recognition that<lb/> there are aspects of formal and non-formal education that can enhance life chances. The formal route (for<lb/> example, through learning mechanisms that generate educational qualifications) tends to be emphasised in<lb/> the human capital work which views education and schooling as an investment that individuals decide<lb/> whether or not to undertake. Non-formal learning experiences, on the other hand, tend to be more relevant<lb/> to social capital discussions where individuals can glean non-monetary benefits that can enhance their life<lb/> chances by participating in the learning experience itself.<lb/> 47.<lb/> The issue of adult, or lifelong, learning is also a relevant policy question. As the earlier<lb/> discussion made clear, large numbers of adults in some countries are hampered by severe deficiencies in<lb/> basic skills. Adult training and learning programmes are important aspects of education policy that can, if<lb/> effective, act to offset these deficiencies to the benefit of the individuals concerned and importantly to their<lb/> families. If they can offset the externality created by intergenerational persistence in low educational<lb/> achievement, then these are an important aspect of education policy.<lb/> 48.<lb/> The different organisation of education systems across countries is also a policy-relevant factor.<lb/> For example, in some countries schools have much more equitable admissions policies than in others. Of<lb/> course, the role of the school itself is a hotly contested issue, especially in the education field, yet most of<lb/> the school effectiveness work (Chevalier, <ref type="biblio">Dolton and Levacic, 2005, Mortimore, 1991, Sammons, 1999,<lb/> Teddlie and Reynolds, 1999</ref>) concludes that which school children attend does matter, even if family issues<lb/> and peer effects may matter more. This can also have an important bearing on the life chances of children<lb/> once they enter adulthood, especially if peer groups have a long-standing influence on economic and social<lb/> outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social policies<lb/></head>

			<p>49.<lb/> The other relevant dimension concerns policies aimed at the key aspects of social disadvantage.<lb/> This is important since, as already noted above, education policies alone may not get to the causes of<lb/> reduced life chances that have their sources in social disadvantage. Policies here include welfare and<lb/> welfare-to-work policies that can enhance family income and lower child poverty which, in turn, can<lb/> improve the educational attainment of children, subject to the debate in the academic literature about<lb/> whether income per se or the characteristics of people that generate low income matter most. If the role of<lb/> income is lower, and it is in fact characteristics that matter more, then structural factors like poor housing<lb/> stock, the local labour market and poor transport access may matter for people in poor neighbourhoods and<lb/> communities. For these individuals in impoverished situations, social policies linked to disadvantage that<lb/> can have the scope to enhance children&apos;s educational performance would be those that are able to alter<lb/> parental attitudes to education (e.g. through parenting programmes) or through community based out-of-<lb/>school programmes (e.g. summer programmes) that can influence the peer groups of children.<lb/> 50.<lb/> Overall, it is how the links between education and social disadvantage generate reduced life<lb/> chances that matters for the policy discussion. The academic research is able to shed light on how such<lb/> mechanisms may occur and thus to provide some insight into the relative merits of educational policies or<lb/> other social policies aimed specifically at social disadvantage. A careful reading of the research, together<lb/> with systematic evaluations of what actual policy interventions are able to do, is key to better<lb/> understanding the need for social policy to be used to offset the reduced life chances of individuals from<lb/> low education and poor social backgrounds.<lb/> 51.<lb/> It is evident that there are some social policies that have more scope to impact on learning of<lb/> people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Whilst these are different in the different educational contexts in<lb/> different countries, there are several of these: scope for offering cash transfers to families with children that<lb/> are conditional on sending children to school; learning programmes targeted at youths who dropped out of<lb/> formal schools; adult training; and, particularly for relatively unskilled workers, policies that provide<lb/> recognition for competences learned on-the-job.<lb/></p>

			<head>Evaluation of policy interventions<lb/></head>

			<p>52.<lb/> The policy discussion above introduced various options that are relevant to the connections<lb/> between education and social disadvantage, and especially to how they influence economic and social<lb/> outcomes across the life course. A key aspect of policy design, however, is that policies are evaluated<lb/> using rigorous and scientifically sound methods. This is important to learn what works and what does not<lb/> work in ameliorating the bad effects of poor education and social disadvantage on an individual&apos;s life<lb/> chances.<lb/> 53.<lb/> This is better recognised by policymakers in some countries and in some government<lb/> departments than in others. Since governments spend sizable amounts of money on policy interventions in<lb/> many areas, it is important to work out whether or not policies are cost-effective. Clearly developing<lb/> policies that can be evaluated in a more systematic way is crucial to this.<lb/> 54.<lb/> To many people the &apos;gold standard&apos; of evaluation methods for policy interventions is to run<lb/> randomized experiments where some people randomly are selected into a policy and others are not. One<lb/> can then carry out a comparison in an analogous way to medical trials by comparing outcomes in the<lb/> treatment group (those in the programme) to those in the control group (those not in the programme). If the<lb/> selection is truly random, then this should give an accurate estimate of the impact of the policy<lb/> intervention.<lb/> 55.<lb/> However, randomized control trials are often highly specific, owing to their very costly nature<lb/> and are difficult to generalise from. They often raise many ethical considerations that mean they are simply<lb/> not viewed as feasible in the social science arena of many countries. Nonetheless it seems fair to say that,<lb/> in the right circumstances randomization can be an attractive, and conceptually appealing, possibility and<lb/> one that governments should be more open to pursue.<lb/> 56.<lb/> However, the line that we require random experiments to be conducted as the only means to<lb/> effectively test policy interventions seems to be rather heroic. First of all, there are instances where random<lb/> experiments are neither feasible nor ethical. Second, closer involvement by potential evaluators in the<lb/> design of policies would seem desirable as a means to better understand what can work. Many policies are<lb/> currently evaluated ex-post, yet a better evaluation may result if potential evaluators were involved ex-ante.<lb/> Thirdly, there are very good examples of non-experimental evaluations that have been conducted without<lb/> randomization.<lb/></p>

			<head>Evidence from evaluations 5<lb/></head>

			<p>57.<lb/> A lot of work looks at the evaluation of education interventions administered both in and outside<lb/> school settings. For this review on education and social disadvantage, there are a number of evidence bases<lb/> that are relevant. These include: school-based programmes; student support; and programmes for adults<lb/> and drop outs. I consider each in turn, with an aim to generate an understanding of what we know about the<lb/> effectiveness of policies aimed at improving the learning experiences of those coming from disadvantaged<lb/> backgrounds.<lb/> School-based programmes<lb/> 58.<lb/> Lavy and Schlosser (2005) argue that, although there have been a large number of interventions<lb/> targeting disadvantaged students in recent years, evidence of their effectiveness remains scanty. Most<lb/> studies are based on small samples and lack proper counterfactuals and cost-benefit analyses. Particularly<lb/> important is the lack of evidence on how effective high-school interventions are, given the debate over the<lb/> relative merit of late versus early childhood interventions (see, for example, <ref type="biblio">Carneiro and Heckman, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 59.<lb/> Research by Lavy and Schlosser (2005) and Lavy (2002) helps to address this problem. These<lb/> authors evaluate a programme of remedial education for underperforming high-school students in Israel<lb/> (implemented since 1999). The objective of this programme is to increase the percentage of students who<lb/> earn matriculation certificates, mainly by means of an increase in instruction time for targeted students.<lb/> Classes were held for these students after school hours and taught by the classroom teachers. Lavy and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Schlosser (2005)</ref> evaluate the programme using a quasi-experimental design: they compare outcomes for a<lb/> &apos;treatment&apos; group and an appropriate &apos;comparison group&apos; before and after the policy was implemented<lb/> (i.e. a difference-in-differences analysis). They find the policy to be highly effective in improving<lb/> outcomes at a cost of $300 per 12 th grade student ($1 000 per targeted student). The group incentive<lb/> programme is evaluated in <ref type="biblio">Lavy (2002)</ref>, where he also evaluates a more conventional programme based on<lb/> providing schools with additional resources to increase teaching time, split up classes into smaller study<lb/> groups and provide extra coaching for weaker students. He finds that overall the estimated effect of the<lb/> resources programme is greater than the &apos;group incentive programme&apos; (though not on every measure), but<lb/> that the cost is over twice as high (i.e. &gt; $340 per student) and is less cost-effective.<lb/> 60.<lb/> The positive evidence for Israel is in marked contrast to that for the United States, where there<lb/> are many examples of anti-dropout programmes for American teenagers that have failed to have any<lb/> impact on graduation rates. These studies are reviewed by <ref type="biblio">Dynarski and Gleason (1998)</ref>. The largest<lb/> 5.<lb/> This Section draws on, and in places reproduces, some of my work on education policy with Sandra McNally.<lb/> federal dropout grants went to efforts to re-structure schools and in general the impact on student outcomes<lb/> was negligible. A criticism of why the policy did not seem effective is that funding was spread too thinly<lb/> across a very large number of schools. This issue of a diffuse spreading of resources across schools is also<lb/> discussed by <ref type="biblio">Bénabou et al. (2005)</ref> in relation to a similar area-based policy in France. &quot; Zones d&apos;Éducation<lb/> Prioritaire&apos;&apos; (ZEP; Priority Education Zones) was launched in 1982 to give greater resources to schools in<lb/> disadvantaged areas. The programme was greatly extended thereafter. There was no clear basis for how<lb/> money was allocated to schools or what it should be used for. The authors estimate that about three-<lb/>quarters was used for teacher bonuses (not related to performance) and one quarter for extra hours of<lb/> teaching. However, the policy had no discernible impact on any of the measures of student achievement.<lb/> Problems include the fact that ZEP status seemed to stigmatize the school (with some reaction from parents<lb/> and teachers); considerable uncertainty over budgets; and a poor targeting of resources.<lb/> 61.<lb/> Similar policies have been implemented in England since the late 1990s. The establishment of<lb/> Education Action Zones (EAZ) was the first such initiative. Each zone (usually 2 or 3 secondary schools<lb/> plus their feeder primary schools) was to be run by a number of &apos;partners&apos;, including the local authority,<lb/> businesses, the voluntary sector and community representatives. The EAZ initiative was effectively<lb/> replaced by the (much larger) Excellence in Cities (EiC) initiative after a relatively short period. The<lb/> funding of both schemes is about £120 per pupil on average – although there is considerably heterogeneity<lb/> between schools and not all pupils will be directly affected by the extra funding. There are a number of<lb/> components to EiC (some of which have changed over time). The main strands are the employment of<lb/> &apos;Learning Mentors&apos;, to help students overcome educational or behavioural problems; the provision of<lb/> &apos;Learning Support Units&apos; to provide short-time teaching and support programmes for difficult pupils; and a<lb/> &apos;Gifted and Talented programme&apos; to provide extra support for 5-10% of pupils in each school. There is<lb/> also provision to designate more schools as &apos;Specialist&apos; (i.e. in particular subjects) or &apos;Beacon&apos; (to<lb/> disseminate good practice). The evaluation evidence for EAZ is mainly qualitative (see <ref type="biblio">Halpin et al, 2004;<lb/> OFSTED, 2003</ref>) and findings are largely negative. The report by <ref type="biblio">OFSTED (2003)</ref> suggests that this was<lb/> due to an over-ambitious programme of activities that did not always focus specifically or radically enough<lb/> on the challenges faced by schools in their areas. In contrast, evaluation evidence for EiC shows that the<lb/> policy has been effective in raising pupil attainment in examinations and increasing attendance at school.<lb/> Initial results suggested that EiC had a modest positive impact after about two years (<ref type="biblio">Machin et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/> 62.<lb/> In conclusion, available evidence suggests that some school-based policies can be effective in<lb/> raising the performance of disadvantaged students and that this can be done cost-effectively. But, for<lb/> programmes to be successful, it matters greatly how the extra resources are spent and that they are<lb/> appropriately targeted.<lb/> Student support<lb/> 63.<lb/> Another type of measure used to increase the educational attainment of disadvantaged students is<lb/> to offer financial incentives with one of more of the following aims: to improve attainment; to discourage<lb/> drop-out; to encourage staying-on in education beyond compulsory school-leaving. An alternative (or<lb/> sometimes additional) strategy has been to provide students with mentors.<lb/> 64.<lb/> In Israel, Angrist and Lavy (2002) evaluate the impact of offering students financial incentives<lb/> for achieving their matriculation certificate. Such an incentive may be helpful if low-achieving students<lb/> have high discount rates, reduce investment in schooling by going to work or face peer pressure not to<lb/> study. The evaluation was done by means of randomized experiment. The analysis leads them to conclude<lb/> that, although the evidence is not seamless, worthwhile gains in matriculation rates can be obtained by<lb/> offering cash rewards in low-achieving schools. The award, worth about $1 429, was paid to 27% of the<lb/> treatment group (which gives a cost of $385 per treated student). They estimate that the programme should<lb/> increase annual earnings in the treated group by about $282 per year – so the cost of the bonus will be<lb/> quickly recovered.<lb/> 65.<lb/> In the United Kingdom, there are also (means-tested) payments given to students to stay on in<lb/> education beyond the age of compulsory school-leaving. This is justified on the basis that many young<lb/> people do not pursue further education because of financial constraints. The education subsidy programme,<lb/> known as the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), was first piloted in a number of areas in England<lb/> from September 1999. It has been carefully evaluated by means of a treatment-control design, using<lb/> methods to ensure that the control group has similar observable characteristics to the treatment group in the<lb/> baseline period. <ref type="biblio">Dearden et al. (2005)</ref> report on the findings and show that the impact of the subsidy is<lb/> quite substantial, with initial participation rates (at age 16/17) being around 4.5 percentage points higher<lb/> than they would have been otherwise. Furthermore, this increase has drawn back to schooling young<lb/> people from both employment and the inactivity group in equal parts – which shows that to a large extent<lb/> the policy is not displacing individuals from work but from unproductive activities. They present a back-<lb/>of-the-envelope cost-benefit analysis and suggest that the net benefits are positive.<lb/> 66.<lb/> There are many studies about the effect of financial aid on the probability of attending college in<lb/> the United States. <ref type="biblio">Dynarski (2005)</ref> argues that most of these are plagued by identification problems, with<lb/> the analyses failing to control for the correlation between college costs and the unobserved determinants of<lb/> schooling outcomes. She states that a handful of well-identified studies have established a strong causal<lb/> link between schooling costs and college attendance. In an earlier paper where she reviews this literature,<lb/> Dynarski (2002) concludes that best estimates suggest eligibility for $1 000 of subsidy increases college<lb/> attendance rates by about 4 percent. However, it is not clear if the effect of such subsidies is higher or<lb/> lower for low-income students.<lb/> 67.<lb/> Heckman and Lochner (2000) are more sceptical about the value of subsidizing low-income<lb/> individuals to stay-on in education because they argue that credit constraints are not an important<lb/> constraint for college-age youth from low-income families. However, they report evidence on the<lb/> effectiveness of some programmes where provision of financial incentives was part of the reform package.<lb/> For example, the &apos;Sponsor-A-Scholar&apos; (SAS) programme was introduced in Philadelphia to help students<lb/> from high school to enter college. The programme provides long-term mentoring (throughout high school<lb/> and one year beyond), substantial academic support, help with college application and financial aid<lb/> procedures and financial support for college-related expenses. $6 000 was offered to all students who went<lb/> to college. Johnson (1998) estimated a 22% increase in college attendant for one year after graduation from<lb/> high school (which fell back to 16% after two years). Impacts were greater for youth who were initially<lb/> less successful academically, were having more school problems and had less family support. However,<lb/> not all mentoring programmes are effective (<ref type="biblio">Sipe, 1996</ref>). Reasons for lack of success include insufficient<lb/> infrastructure to screen and monitor volunteer efforts or to match youth to appropriate mentors.<lb/> 68.<lb/> Among the other successful programmes discussed by Heckman and Lochner (2000) are the<lb/> Quantum Opportunity Programme (QOP), which offered four years (high school years) of social and<lb/> emotional support, together with financial assistance for individuals interested in post-secondary education<lb/> or training. The QOP offered disadvantaged minority students financial incentives for every hour spent in<lb/> activities aimed at improving social and market skills. The evaluation (based on randomized trials) found<lb/> that two years after programme completion, about one-third more QOP participants graduated from high-<lb/>school (or obtained their GED) than similar non-participants. There was also a substantial reduction in<lb/> crime – arrest rates for participants were half that of non-participants. The average four-year cost per<lb/> participant was high, at $10 500. However, the cost-benefit analysis estimated positive net social returns<lb/> (driven largely by the crime reduction aspect).<lb/> 69.<lb/> Finally, Heckman and Lochner (2000) discuss two other studies that they claim show that<lb/> creative programmes designed to keep adolescents in school can be effective. Ohio&apos;s Learning, Earning<lb/> and Parenting (LEAP) programme and Teenage Parent Demonstration (TPD) provided financial<lb/> incentives for teenage parents on welfare to stay in school or take GED classes. Both programmes have<lb/> been evaluated by randomized trials and show success in terms of high school graduation and earnings.<lb/> Heckman and Lochner (2000) conclude that the much larger and broader benefits of QOP suggest that<lb/> combining incentives with the academic and social support of a caring and qualified mentor provides the<lb/> greatest promise for troubled adolescents.<lb/> Programmes for adults and high-school drop-outs<lb/> 70.<lb/> Many programmes have been introduced to improve the earnings of the most disadvantaged in<lb/> the general working-age population. They are diverse in nature and it is somewhat difficult to form an<lb/> overall conclusion regarding their effectiveness, but I consider some of them in this sub-section.<lb/> 71.<lb/> There have been many evaluations of adult programmes in the United States and several reviews<lb/> of the evidence including <ref type="biblio">Friedlander et al. (1997)</ref>, Heckman and Lochner (2000) and LaLonde (1995). In<lb/> all three reviews, it is remarked that a modest investment has yielded a modest return; but that these<lb/> programmes are insufficient to have much effect on poverty rates. As <ref type="biblio">Friedlander et al. (1997)</ref> put it &quot;the<lb/> broadest generalization about the current knowledge of government training programmes for the<lb/> disadvantaged is that they have produced modest positive effects on employment and earnings for adult<lb/> men and women that are roughly commensurate with the modest amounts of resources expended on them&quot;.<lb/> In their view, results from the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) evaluation are most important because<lb/> the programme is national in scope and the survey design was experimental (and is considered<lb/> demonstrably more reliable than the non-experimental studies in this literature).<lb/> 72.<lb/> Heckman and Lochner (2000) discuss the few training programmes that have demonstrated a<lb/> positive impact on youth earnings. The most well-known is the Job Corps, an intensive programme<lb/> ($20 000 per participant) that provides extremely disadvantaged youth with basic education, vocational<lb/> skills and a wide range of support services in a residential environment. The evaluation (Long, Mallar and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Thornton, 1981</ref>) showed an increase in education, employment and earnings and estimated a net return of<lb/> 8-9% (though much of this is accounted for by a reduction in violent crime). More recent random<lb/> assignment evaluations (<ref type="biblio">Burghardt et al., 2001</ref>) show something of a more mixed picture for men (with<lb/> gains occurring if they moved residence, but not for those on non-residential programmes) and earnings<lb/> gains accruing to women participating the programme.<lb/> 73.<lb/> A similar programme, Jobstart, was designed to be a less intensive and less expensive version of<lb/> this programme (with less intensive services in a non-residential setting). Although the cost was much<lb/> lower ($6 000 per participant), so were the benefits. There was only a small overall impact on earnings,<lb/> education and crime – though there were two particular sub-groups for which earnings returns were very<lb/> high: men arrested between the age of 16 and programme entry; and youths who had dropped out of school<lb/> for educational reasons. From their comparison of programmes, Heckman and Lochner (2000) draw the<lb/> following conclusions: &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;; the effect of treatment may vary substantially among<lb/> subgroups; and these types of programme have outcomes beyond schooling and work that should be<lb/> considered such as a reduction in crime.<lb/> 74.<lb/> There are many training and education programmes for youth and adults in Europe (with a<lb/> particular focus on the unemployed). Evaluation evidence is summarized by <ref type="biblio">Ryan (2001a, 2001b</ref>). Unlike<lb/> some of the US work, evaluation is not conducted using randomized experiments and generally, there is no<lb/> cost-benefit analysis. However, there have been efforts to construct a valid treatment and comparison<lb/> group (see, for example, Payne, 2000). In the United Kingdom, there were a number of programmes<lb/> implemented to train unemployed adults in the 1980s. Ryan (2001a) discusses evaluation of the Job<lb/> Training Scheme (mid-80s), and the Employment Training and Training for Work programmes (1988-98).<lb/> All programmes show substantial improvements in employment-related outcomes. However, they show no<lb/> effect for earnings, apart from the Job Training Scheme, where some doubt is cast on the quality of the data<lb/> and the matching of participants and non-participants in the evaluation.<lb/> 75.<lb/> With regard to youth programmes, evaluation evidence is extensive for France, Sweden and the<lb/> United Kingdom (Ryan 2001b). In contrast to the United States, some programmes do report<lb/> improvements in participants&apos; employment prospects, as indicated by the incidence and duration of their<lb/> subsequent experiences of employment and unemployment. Evidence on pay effects is mainly limited to<lb/> Britain and several evaluations of the Youth Training Scheme have found that it reduced participants&apos;<lb/> earning power. Ryan (2001b) suggests that the difference between effects on unemployment and pay may<lb/> reflect two factors: the general sensitivity of econometric findings to the choice of model and data;<lb/> secondly, the tendency of European programmes to bring young people into contact with low-wage<lb/> employers who offer little training, but who are prepared to hire many of them afterwards.<lb/> 76.<lb/> In conclusion, there is good evidence from the United States (mostly, though not exclusively,<lb/> based on randomised experiments) that more intensive programmes can improve the education and skills<lb/> of adults and thereby have a positive effect on earnings. Apart from a few notable exceptions, these<lb/> programmes have had no impact on high-school dropouts. European evidence shows that such programmes<lb/> can have employment impacts (both for adults and youth), but tend to show no positive impact for earnings<lb/> (where this has been considered). General concerns in this literature are the reliability of the evaluation<lb/> methodology (except for when randomised experiments are used); the short-term nature of many<lb/> interventions and evaluations; wider effects that are not often considered by evaluators, such as crime and<lb/> indirect effects (for example, consideration of whether employment programmes displace workers who<lb/> would otherwise be employed).<lb/></p>

			<head>V.<lb/> Concluding remarks<lb/></head>

			<p>77.<lb/> In this paper I have set out a discussion of the links between education experiences and social<lb/> disadvantage, with a focus on how they impinge on individual&apos;s life chances and on how social policy is<lb/> closed tied to this. The evidence from empirical research is that education and social disadvantage are<lb/> closely connected and that people from less advantaged family backgrounds acquire significantly less<lb/> education than their more advantaged counterparts. This translates into significantly reduced life chances<lb/> as individuals&apos; economic and social outcomes as adults are significantly hampered by lower education<lb/> levels owing to social disadvantage. This includes poorer labour market outcomes, and significantly worse<lb/> health, higher crime levels and lower levels of social capital.<lb/> 78.<lb/> Social policy is highly relevant to the worsened life chances resulting from low education and<lb/> social disadvantage. Social policy can be highly complementary with education policy, and in some<lb/> situations the combination of both may be needed to ensure effective intervention. There is clear scope to<lb/> improve economic and social efficiency through appropriately designed policy interventions, as some of<lb/> the policy evaluation work I have discussed makes clear. It is, however, absolutely crucial that<lb/> policymakers carefully monitor and evaluate such interventions so as to get a better understanding of what<lb/> can work in enhancing life chances from better education provision via the reduction of social<lb/> disadvantage. Central to this is using rigorous and well-defined evaluation strategies to ascertain the<lb/> effectiveness and payoffs that can result from education and social policy interventions.<lb/></p>
