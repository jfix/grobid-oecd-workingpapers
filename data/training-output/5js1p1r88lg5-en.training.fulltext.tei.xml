			<figure>• In many countries, less experienced teachers (those with less than five years&apos; teaching experience) are<lb/> more likely to work in challenging schools and less likely to report confidence in their teaching abilities<lb/> than more experienced teachers.<lb/> • Most countries have activities in place aimed at preparing teachers for work, such as induction and<lb/> mentoring programmes.<lb/> • Approximately 44% of teachers work in schools where principals report that all new teachers have access<lb/> to formal induction programmes; 76% work in schools with access to informal induction; and 22% work<lb/> in schools that only have programmes for teachers new to teaching.<lb/> • Fewer teachers report participation in induction and mentoring programmes than principals report<lb/> the existence of such programmes.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Challenges facing new teachers<lb/></head>

			<p>TALIS 2008 (OECD, 2012) illustrated many of the challenges facing new teachers, such as struggling to keep order<lb/> in the classroom. TALIS 2013 extends the understanding of new teachers&apos; working environments by examining how<lb/> new and more experienced teachers are allocated to challenging schools. Indeed, it could be expected that education<lb/> systems would try to make the most out of their human resources, by allocating their most experienced teachers<lb/> to the most challenging schools. Yet, the TALIS data suggests that the opposite can be observed. In most TALIS<lb/> countries, it is more likely that new (i.e. those with five years&apos; experience or less) rather than experienced teachers<lb/> will teach in schools where over 30% of students come from socially disadvantaged homes (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>); where at least<lb/> 10% of students have special needs; and where at least 10% are children whose first language is different than the<lb/> language of instruction.<lb/></p>

			<p>What is TALIS?<lb/></p>

			<table>TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) is the first international survey examining teaching and learning<lb/> environments in schools. It asks teachers and school principals about their work, their schools and their classrooms.<lb/> This cross-country analysis helps countries identify others facing similar challenges and learn about their policies.<lb/> TALIS 2013 focused on lower secondary education teachers and their principals. It sampled 200 schools in more than<lb/> 30 countries and 20 teachers in each school.<lb/> More information available at www.oecd.org/talis<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> T E AC HING in Focus<lb/> 2015/11 (May)<lb/></table>

			<p>Teaching in Focus<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> Moreover, across TALIS countries, teachers with less than five years&apos; experience are more likely than experienced<lb/> teachers to teach in rural areas, where schools often have fewer resources. TALIS shows that teachers&apos; self-efficacy<lb/> generally increases over time. Although new teachers tend to be less confident in their teaching abilities than<lb/> their more experienced colleagues, they often face more challenging work environments. Experience takes time to<lb/> accumulate, but confidence can be boosted through participation in professional development, such as induction<lb/> programmes and mentoring.<lb/></p>

			<head>Availability of support programmes for new teachers<lb/></head>

			<p>Induction programmes are completed during a teacher&apos;s first regular teaching position and can be formal or informal<lb/> in nature (OECD, 2014a). These activities can help link pre-service teacher training to the reality of day-to-day work<lb/> in the classroom.<lb/> Access to induction programmes varies. As <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows, 44% of teachers work in schools where principals report<lb/> that formal induction programmes are available for all new teachers; 22% work in schools where formal induction<lb/> programmes are only available for teachers new to teaching; and 76% of teachers work in schools that have informal<lb/> induction programmes. In Brazil, Mexico, Poland, Portugal and Spain, between 70% and 80% of teachers have no<lb/> access to formal induction programmes. In Japan and Mexico, about 60% of teachers have no access to informal<lb/> induction programmes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Participation in support programmes for new teachers<lb/></head>

			<p>In most TALIS countries, teachers report lower participation rates in induction programmes than principals report<lb/> access to these programmes. As <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows</p>

			<table>, 70% of teachers with less than 3 years&apos; experience work in schools where<lb/> principals report access to induction programmes, however only about 50% report participating in such programmes.<lb/> Teaching in Focus<lb/> To learn more<lb/> OECD (2014a), TALIS 2013 Results: An International Perspective on Teaching<lb/> and Learning, TALIS, OECD Publishing, Paris.<lb/> OECD (2014b), A Teachers&apos; Guide to TALIS 2013, TALIS, OECD Publishing, Paris.<lb/> OECD (2012), The experience of new teachers: Results from TALIS 2008, TALIS,<lb/> OECD Publishing, Paris.<lb/> Contact:<lb/> Katarzyna Kubacka<lb/> (katarzyna.kubacka@oecd.org)<lb/> Visit<lb/> www.oecd.org/talis<lb/> Education Indicators in Focus<lb/> Pisa in Focus<lb/></table>

			<p>The bottom line New teachers often face the same, if not more challenging, working environments<lb/> as more experienced teachers; however, they often lack the professional experience and confidence to<lb/> easily handle these challenges. Education systems should review their policies for allocating teachers to<lb/> the more challenging schools, as well as invest in extending access to professional support for new teachers<lb/> through induction programmes and mentoring activities. Attention also needs to be paid to maximising the<lb/> participation in such programmes by eliminating barriers and creating incentives for participation.<lb/></p>

			<head>What this means in practice<lb/> What this means in practice<lb/></head>

			<p>For many countries, participation in mentoring programmes is also lower than access, partly because not every<lb/> teacher will have a mentor and some may serve as mentors themselves. However, even when taking this into account<lb/> the difference between access and participation is considerable in some countries. For example, in the Netherlands,<lb/> 71% of all teachers work in schools with reported mentoring programmes, while only 17% report having a mentor.</p>
