			<table>Teaching in Focus – 2017/16 (April) ©OECD 2017<lb/> How can professional development enhance<lb/> teachers&apos; classroom practices?<lb/></table>

			<figure>• Teacher professional development is deemed to be high quality when it includes opportunities for active<lb/> learning methods, an extended time period, a group of colleagues, and collective learning activities<lb/> or research with other teachers. The higher the exposure of teachers to high-quality professional<lb/> development, the more likely they are to use a wide variety of teaching practices in the classroom.<lb/> • Professional development activities that focus on curriculum knowledge (rather than subject knowledge<lb/> or pedagogy) and that involve collaborating with other teachers seem particularly well suited to<lb/> enhancing teachers&apos; classroom practices. However, these types of professional development are not<lb/> those that are most widely used around the world.<lb/> • Not all teachers have equal access to high-quality professional development. In some countries and<lb/> economies, different participation rates in high-quality professional development are observed between<lb/> male and female teachers, as well as between teachers who have and have not completed initial teacher<lb/> education.<lb/></figure>

			<p>What is TALIS?<lb/></p>

			<table>TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) is the first international survey examining teaching and learning<lb/> environments in schools. It asks teachers and school principals about their work, their schools and their classrooms.<lb/> This cross-country analysis helps countries identify others facing similar challenges and learn about their policies.<lb/> TALIS 2013 focused on lower secondary education teachers and their principals. It sampled 200 schools in more than<lb/> 30 countries and 20 teachers in each school.<lb/> More information is available at: www.oecd.org/talis<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> TA LI S<lb/> Participation in high-quality professional development and classroom practices<lb/></table>

			<p>Ensuring that teachers around the world have the essential competencies they require to be effective in the<lb/> classroom is key to raising levels of student achievement. Education systems, therefore, seek to provide teachers<lb/> with opportunities for developing and extending their competencies in order to achieve or maintain a high-standard<lb/> of teaching and develop a high-quality teacher workforce.<lb/></p>

			<p>Teacher professional development is deemed to be high quality when it includes opportunities for active learning<lb/> methods (i.e. not only listening to a lecturer), an extended time period, a group of colleagues from the teacher&apos;s<lb/> school or subject group, and collective learning activities or research with other teachers. According to TALIS 2013<lb/> data from 35 countries and economies, teachers who have taken part in high-quality professional development<lb/> are also more likely to use classroom practices that are known to promote student learning (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), such as<lb/> presenting a summary of recently learned content, having students work in small groups, and providing written or<lb/> immediate feedback on student work -see Box 1 for a description of the ten main classroom practices identified.<lb/> A positive relationship between participation in high-quality professional development and at least 5 of the</p>

			<p>In order to understand how policy makers can meet the demand for teacher professional development so as to achieve<lb/> or maintain quality education, it is important to consider the content and the delivery mode that best promote this<lb/> development.<lb/> Professional development activities usually focus on three types of content: 1) subject matter, knowledge and<lb/> understanding of teachers&apos; subject field(s); 2) pedagogy, pedagogical competencies in teaching teachers&apos; subject<lb/> field(s); and 3) curriculum, knowledge of the curriculum. Teachers who have participated in professional development<lb/> activities that focus on any of these types of content also tend to more frequently use often-praised classroom practices<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). For every country and economy (with the exception of Croatia), there is one focus of professional<lb/> development activities that is consistently positively related to a more intense use of at least some instructional<lb/> methods.<lb/> Participating in professional development that focuses on the curriculum rather than subject matter or pedagogy<lb/> makes a teacher more likely to report making an effort to enhance students&apos; learning and means teachers are more<lb/> likely to use each instructional method (with the exception of presenting a summary of recently learned content and<lb/> checking students&apos; notebooks).<lb/></p>

			<head>Do all teachers have access to high-quality professional development?<lb/></head>

			<p>Providing teachers with professional development programmes that focus on knowledge of the curriculum and include<lb/> collaborative learning activities or research with other teachers is an efficient way of supporting teachers&apos; work. However,<lb/> these types of professional development programmes are much less widespread than other kinds of professional<lb/> development activities. In 28 countries and economies, teachers participate less often in curriculum-focused professional<lb/> development than in programmes covering subject knowledge or pedagogy (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Similarly, in 27 countries and<lb/> economies, teachers participate less often in professional development programmes that include some collaborative<lb/> activities with other teachers than in programmes that include any other kind of delivery feature.<lb/></p>

			<head>How to best implement teacher professional development?<lb/></head>

			<p>Apart from the focus of teacher professional development, how it is delivered is essential for developing teachers&apos;<lb/> instructional practices. The components of professional development activities that best support teachers&apos; work include:<lb/> active learning – giving teachers opportunities for active learning methods apart from simply listening to a lecture; duration<lb/> – an extended time period with several occasions for professional development spread out over several weeks or months;<lb/> collective participation – including a group of colleagues from the teacher&apos;s school or subject group; and collaboration –<lb/> collaborative learning activities or research with other teachers. These are all features of professional development that<lb/> are, in general, positively related with a more intense use of classroom practices. Some negative associations are observed,<lb/> in particular, when collective participation is involved. Collaborative learning activities or research with other teachers<lb/> are the only features of professional development programmes that are consistently positively associated with teachers&apos;<lb/> instructional methods.<lb/></p>

			<p>The bottom line Teachers&apos; classroom practices seem to benefit from teachers&apos; participation in high-<lb/>quality professional development activities. However, only a small proportion of teachers have participated<lb/> in such programmes. Educational systems could enhance teaching quality by increasing the opportunities<lb/> for professional development. In some countries and economies, different participation rates in high-<lb/>quality professional development are observed between female and male teachers, with female teachers<lb/> more likely to participate in high-quality professional development in Chile, Estonia, Portugal, the Russian<lb/> Federation and Spain, while the opposite pattern is found in the Netherlands and in Norway. Similar<lb/> differences in participation are observed between teachers who have and have not completed initial teacher<lb/> education. Wherever such differences in participation exist, education systems should remove the barriers<lb/> to accessing the kinds of high-quality professional development related to teacher gender or completion of<lb/> initial teacher education.<lb/> This paper is published under the responsibility of the Secretary-General of the OECD.
