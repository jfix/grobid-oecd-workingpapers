            <figDesc>The Decisions at Marrakesh include a Notification Procedure that has an indicative list of<lb/> notifiable measures. This list includes: quantitative restrictions, other non-tariff measures such as licensing;<lb/> export taxes, and export restrictions, including voluntary export restraints and orderly marketing<lb/> arrangements. 31 However, a note to this indicative list states that it does not alter existing notification<lb/> requirements in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and the Plurilateral Trade Agreements of the WTO. In<lb/> this sense, the initiative proposed by the United States, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei regarding export<lb/> licensing is one example of efforts undertaken to enhance transparency regarding export restrictions.<lb/> 31.<lb/> After the Uruguay Round, a decision by the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) in 1995 created<lb/> procedures on biennial notification of quantitative restrictions. 32 The format of the notification does not<lb/> include export duties or taxes, seeming to reflect current disciplines on Article XI and relevant provisions<lb/> which exclude export duties from the application. The other decision by the CTG in 1995 established so<lb/> called reverse notification procedures to allow Members to indicate specific non tariff measures of other<lb/> Members for transparency purpose, but this process has rarely been used by Members. 33 Therefore, no<lb/> decisions specifically entail a notification obligation of export duties.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>). Regarding export duties, although there is no binding schedule for the existing Members, many<lb/> new Members committed to bind their export duty rates. Notably in the case of China, 84 specific items<lb/> have been scheduled, with the commitment to eliminate all export duties except on these items. The<lb/> schedule indicates the rate of bound export duties. Export restrictions were also one of the topics in the<lb/> discussion on Russia&apos;s accession. 35<lb/> 34.<lb/> The necessity and efforts to provide more discipline on export restrictions were not always shared<lb/> among WTO members. During Ukraine&apos;s accession negotiation, some Members stated that Ukraine&apos;s<lb/> export duties were very high, with a strong trade-distorting impact, and in some cases too prohibitive for<lb/> trade. A Member noted that Ukraine appeared to apply trade-related investment measures (TRIM) by<lb/> granting an exemption from export duties to agricultural producers, contingent on the production of certain<lb/> agricultural commodities. In contrast, some developing country Members had a positive view of export<lb/> duties as a development instrument. Other Members noted that the imposition of export duties was not<lb/> inconsistent with WTO rules. 36<lb/> 34<lb/> Paragraph 1.2 of Part I of the Accession Protocol makes it clear that the Protocol, including the commitments<lb/> referred in the Working Party Report, shall be an integral part of the WTO Agreement.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In the EU, Article 25 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulates that custom<lb/> duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member<lb/> States. This prohibition shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. Article 29 provides that<lb/> quantitative restrictions on exports, and all measures having equivalent effect, shall be prohibited between<lb/> Member States. Although there are exceptions to this general prohibition on quantitative restrictions, these<lb/> exceptions do not apply to export duties. 37<lb/> 37.<lb/> The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is also stringent regarding export<lb/> restrictions. Article 314 of the NAFTA imposes a prohibition on export taxes, subject to a Mexican<lb/> exception for basic foods set out in Annex 314. Regarding quantitative restrictions, it provides general<lb/> rules in line with Article XI of the GATT 1994. Article 315 further specifies the conditions of exceptions<lb/> in Articles XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT 1994 by articulating detailed requirements such as<lb/> comparison of trade volumes. 38 Overall, these provisions help to enhance transparency and narrow the<lb/> scope of unpredictability by articulating regulations in annexes and detailed requirements in the provisions.</figDesc>

Exports of<lb/> wood (raw or semi-processed logs) are subject to an export tax of 17.5% of the f.o.b. value.<lb/> Export taxes on logs have been imposed to encourage processing and hence local added<lb/> value.

As of 2008, export<lb/> levy of 5% based on the value of exported unpolished diamonds has been applied. South<lb/> Africa also imposes an export levy of R 0.05 per litre of exported wine.<lb/> Suriname<lb/> (2004)<lb/> All exports are subject to a consent fee of 0.1%. A statistical fee of 0.5% applies to exports of<lb/> all products except bauxite, which is subject to a statistical fee of 2%.

Rates are expressed as ad<lb/> valorem rates of minimum f.o.b. values determined by the Government. In April 2004, the rates<lb/> were 20% for logs, and 5% and 10% for hewn-squares, sleepers (ties), and other semi-<lb/>processed timber. In 2002, wood export taxes accounted for some 0.1% of current<lb/> Government revenue.</figDesc>
