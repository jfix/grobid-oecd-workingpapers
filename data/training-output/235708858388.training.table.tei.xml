            <table>Box 4. Mandates to carry out environmental assessments<lb/> • The EU carries out Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) for the negotiation of major multilateral, regional<lb/> and bilateral trade agreements. This practice has not yet evolved into a strict legal obligation but is supported<lb/> by the Communication on Impact Assessment issued by the EU Commission in 2002, which has the legal<lb/> status of a policy guideline. It requires the Commission to execute environmental, economic and social impact<lb/> studies for different types of major regulatory initiatives; http://www.trade-<lb/>nfo.cec.eu.int/doclib/docs/2005/february/tradoc_121479.pdf.<lb/> • Canada derives its mandate to conduct Environmental Assessments (EAs) of trade agreements from the 1999<lb/> &quot; Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals &quot; and the 2001<lb/> &quot; Framework for Conducting Environmental Assessment of Trade Negotiations &quot; ; http://www.dfait-<lb/>maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/Environment-en.asp#annex1 (1999 Cabinet Directive); http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-<lb/>nac/Environment-en.asp#N_1_ (2001 Framework).<lb/> • In New Zealand, a Parliamentary Standing Order requires that a National Interest Analysis be conducted for all<lb/> treaties to which New Zealand may become a Party. The NIA includes an environmental component and is<lb/> supported by the 2001 &quot; Framework for Integrating Environmental Standards and Trade Agreements &quot; .<lb/> However, a NIA is required after the agreement is signed, so there is no opportunity to influence the<lb/> negotiating mandate or the negotiations. http://www.clerk.parliament.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/636A8940-48FA-<lb/>4A93-B8E6-3DD0844BB68E/0/SO2003bm.pdf (Parliamentary Standing Order 383);<lb/> http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Trade-and-Economic-Relations/0--Trade-archive/WTO/0-environment-framework.php<lb/> (2001 Framework).<lb/> • In the United States, the framework for conducting Environmental Reviews (ERs) of trade agreements is<lb/> provided by Executive Order 13141 &quot; Environmental Review of Trade Agreements &quot; (1999) and the Guidelines<lb/> for Implementation of Executive Order 13141 (2000) http://www.nepa.gov/nepa/regs/eos/eo13141.html (1999<lb/> Executive Order 13141);<lb/> http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Environment/Guidelines_for_Environmental_Reviews/asset_upload<lb/> _file556_5734.pdf (2000 Guidelines).<lb/> Box 5. Geographical scope of assessments<lb/> • Environmental assessments of trade agreements by Canada and the United States focus on environmental<lb/> impacts in their respective countries. Transboundary effects are only considered to the extent that they have<lb/> direct impacts on the environment in the assessing country.<lb/> • The EU&apos;s Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs) explore not only environmental but also economic and<lb/> social impacts. They also focus on impacts in partner countries. Some assessments involve almost no analysis<lb/> of impacts in the EU but focus almost exclusively on environmental impacts in partner countries, such as the<lb/> ongoing EU-African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) SIA.<lb/> http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/issues/global/sia/studies_geo.htm#acp<lb/> Box 6. In-house vs. external assessments<lb/> • In Canada and the United States, environmental assessments are conducted by the government, and involve<lb/> government experts and negotiators. The US also seeks and incorporates, as appropriate, public comment on<lb/> its environmental reviews.<lb/> • The EU Commission awards contracts to carry out SIAs to independent external consultants following a public<lb/> tender procedure. A consultation committee within the Commission is set up to guide the consultants. Civil<lb/> society coordination with Member State experts and Members of the European Parliament is part of the SIA<lb/> process. Box 7. Methodologies for environmental reviews of trade agreements<lb/> • Details on methodologies applied in recent assessments can be found on the websites referred to in Box 6.<lb/> • Guidance on approaches developed by the OECD can be found in<lb/> OECD methodologies for environmental and trade reviews<lb/> http://www.oecd.org/document/45/0,3343,en_2649_34183_36629293_1_1_1_1,00.html<lb/> Checklist of Issues for Ex Ante Environmental Assessments of Trade Liberalisation<lb/> [COM/TD/ENV(2001)42/FINAL]. http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2001doc.nsf/LinkTo/COM-TD-ENV(2001)42-<lb/>FINAL.<lb/> Assessing the Environmental Effects of Services Trade Liberalisation: a Methodology<lb/> [COM/TD/ENV(2000)123/FINAL]. http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2000doc.nsf/LinkTo/com-td-env(2000)123-final.<lb/> • Guidance on &quot; Rapid Trade and Environment Assessments &quot; by the International Institute for Sustainable<lb/> Development can be found at http://www.iisd.org/trade/policy/rapid_trade.asp.<lb/> • The EU has produced a specific methodology for its Trade SIAs.
