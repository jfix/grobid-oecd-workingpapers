The APT band plans were refined over a period<lb/> of two years, during which time numerous related studies were conducted (including band edge studies), before being<lb/> finally agreed in September 2011. Both band plans have been adopted as part of the LTE standard by the international<lb/> 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and maximise efficient use of the spectrum.<lb/> Australia has adopted the FDD version of the APT band plan, which identifies two 45 MHz segments of paired<lb/> spectrum within 703–803 MHz, optimised for mobile broadband. It offers the opportunity for significant economies<lb/> of scale, enabling cheaper devices and international roaming benefits.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Amendment to the law was enacted in May 2008 and came into force in October 2008. Relevant administrative rules<lb/> were also reviewed and modified accordingly. The main points of these modifications are as follows:<lb/> • Small base stations, such as femtocells installed inside buildings, were allowed to be licensed collectively for<lb/> each region, instead of individual licenses required for each such station before the amendment.<lb/> • Femtocells and repeaters (amplifiers) were allowed to be operated by non-qualified users who are not licensees of<lb/> spectrum, without surveillance of qualified technicians.<lb/> • Technological conditions such as power limitations that femtocells should meet were established.<lb/> • Application formats for collective licenses of femtocells and repeaters were simplified.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Current situation of Television White Spaces in selected OECD countries<lb/> United States: The Federal Communication Commission&apos;s rules permit unlicensed radio devices to transmit on white<lb/> space spectrum bands used by the broadcast television service (i.e. 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-<lb/>698 MHz). In order to protect television broadcast and other licensed services operating in these bands, the rules<lb/> require the TV white space devices to obtain a list of channels available for their operation. On 1 March 2013, the<lb/> Commission&apos;s Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) authorised approved television white space database<lb/> systems to provide service to unlicensed radio devices that operate in these spectrum bands.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>UnitedKingdom: Ofcom has been investigating possible use of white space spectrum since 2007. It preliminarily<lb/> proposed license-exempt access, taking into account geolocation information provided by databases to location-aware<lb/> white space wireless devices. As a result, Ofcom believes that license exempt devices could be authorised to use<lb/> television white spaces, provided they operated in specific frequencies and at specific powers communicated to them<lb/> by a TV white space data base (see Figure), in order to avoid harmful interference with television services operating<lb/> in these bands. On 26 April 2013 Ofcom announced plans for a pilot of innovative &apos;white space&apos; technology in the<lb/> United Kingdom and invited industry to take part in the pilot, which is intended to take place in the autumn. The<lb/> locations for the trial will be chosen once trial participants have been identified. Following a successful completion of<lb/> the pilot, Ofcom anticipates that the technology could be fully rolled out during 2014, enabling the use of white space<lb/> devices across the country.<lb/> The Cambridge White Space Consortium: This Consortium designed a trial to assist Ofcom in its proposals for a<lb/> license-exempt access to white space spectrum and to provide information on potential application in this band. Some<lb/> of the experiments focus on the protection requirements for existing devices, the elements needed in the geo-location<lb/> database, including reference geometries, coupling factors and protection ratios. They also address the presence of<lb/> PMSE (Programme Making and Special Events) devices in white space spectrum. The Consortium brings together<lb/> over 300 companies. In April 2013, Ofcom announced plans for another pilot, with a view to rolling out white space<lb/> devices technology across the United Kingdom during</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In the reverse auction, broadcasters would have at least four options: i) do not participate in the auction and<lb/> stay on the air on the same or another channel in the same band, as determined in the repacking process; ii) participate<lb/> and bid to give up all rights to their channel and go off the air; iii) participate and bid to give up all rights to their<lb/> channel but share a channel with another broadcaster after the auction; or iv) participate and bid to give up all rights<lb/> to their channel but move from UHF to VHF and remain on the air. All options are designed to help make the<lb/> auction accessible to the widest possible range of broadcaster participants.<lb/> The forward auction piece of the incentive auction will differ from the typical spectrum auction because,<lb/> unlike typical spectrum auctions, the number and locations of licenses available in the forward auction will depend<lb/> upon the results of the reverse auction. The FCC is considering innovative new approaches to auction design to<lb/> manage this interrelationship and integrate the different auction components.</figDesc>
