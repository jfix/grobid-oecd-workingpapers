			<p>1.<lb/> Trade linkages and trade global consistency are essential components of the projections published<lb/> in the OECD Economic Outlook. The OECD system of trade linkages relies on a matrix of bilateral flows<lb/> of goods and services between OECD countries and several non-OECD countries and zones. 2 The<lb/> construction of such a matrix is not an easy task given limited data availability on bilateral trade flows for<lb/> some countries and the need to combine different sources while keeping the matrix consistent with national<lb/> trade data.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> This paper first details the methodology and sources used to build the most recent trade matrix<lb/> for 2005. It then compares the current trade matrix to the previous 2000 version in order to assess the<lb/> evolution of global trade flows over this period. 3 As expected, it shows that the share of non-OECD<lb/> countries, essentially Dynamic Asian economies and China, in world trade has increased, mostly at the<lb/> expense of North America, and to a lesser extent of OECD Asian countries. OECD Europe as a whole has<lb/> managed to maintain its market share. The paper also provides a very detailed review of each country&apos;s<lb/> main trading partners. Annex 1 presents the geographical breakdown and country and zone abbreviations.<lb/> Annex 2 presents some technical details on the construction of the</p>

			<table>2005 trade matrix and Annex 3 presents<lb/> some country details on the change in the geographical trade structure between 2000 and 2005.<lb/> 1.<lb/> The authors are members of Country Studies IV and the Macroeconomic Analysis Division of the OECD<lb/> Economics Department. They would like to thank Richard Herd and Christian Gianella for helpful<lb/> comments and discussions and Diane Scott for assistance in preparing the document. The views expressed<lb/> in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the OECD or its member<lb/> countries.<lb/> 2.<lb/> The OECD trade system uses a fixed matrix which is updated by five years every five years. The advantage<lb/> of a fixed matrix for competitiveness indicators is that it enables the assessment of the impact of changes in<lb/> prices which can be isolated from changes in weights due to the change in countries&apos; relative market share.<lb/> One disadvantage is that for historical years far away from the base year the weights derived from the<lb/> matrix do not reflect the prevailing structure of trade.<lb/> 3.<lb/> The 2000 matrix is described in Le Fouler et al. (2001).<lb/></table>

			<head>1.<lb/> Methodology and data sources of the bilateral trade matrix<lb/></head>

			<p>3.<lb/> The OECD trade system is based on a 45 by 45 matrix of bilateral trade flows of goods and<lb/> services covering the 33 OECD countries as well as nine non-OECD economies and three non-OECD<lb/> economics areas. 4 The matrix is used to build several indicators including those for export markets for<lb/> goods and services and competitiveness (see <ref type="biblio">Pain et al., 2005 and Box 1</ref>). These indicators in turn play an<lb/> important role in analysing recent trade developments, in informing trade projections and in enforcing<lb/> global trade consistency.<lb/></p>

In particular, the system has recently increased<lb/> from 30 OECD countries, China and five non-member zones to 33 OECD countries (following the<lb/> accession of Chile, Slovenia and Israel in 2010) as well as nine non-OECD economies and three non-<lb/>OECD economics areas (see Annex 1). For the sake of comparison with the 2000 system the updated 2005<lb/> system still includes an OECD30 zone including only the countries that were part of the OECD in 2000.<lb/> Since Israel joined in September 2010 after most of the calculations in this paper were completed it is not<lb/> included in some of the OECD aggregates.<lb/> Shadow price of non-commodity goods and services imports (PMSHX)<lb/></table>

			<head>Calculation of intra trade times series for the zones<lb/> Calculation of the share of extra and intra trade for each country<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the trade goods and services matrix gives the share of imports and exports for a country with all countries<lb/> in the world, the share of trade with a specific zone, and the share of trade with the rest of the world excluding this<lb/> zone can be calculated. These shares are then applied to each export and import series (values and volumes in 2005<lb/> prices) of each country&apos;s total trade to obtain series for extra and intra trade for a given zone.<lb/></p>

			<head>Aggregation of goods and services series for intra and extra trade<lb/></head>

			<p>Using a chainlink method, with fixed weights in 2005 it is possible to obtained the extra trade imports and exports<lb/> for a zone, the intra trade of imports and exports for a zone and the total trade of imports and exports for a zone<lb/> defined as the sum of intra and extra trade.<lb/> For instance for exports of intra trade exports of zone i Xi is derived from a weighted average of the exports of the<lb/> p countries belonging to the zone. The weights are the share of the zone in the exports of the country in 2005.<lb/></p>

			<p>The evolution of intra and extra trade of the OECD and the euro area is shown on the figure below. The first part<lb/> of the 2000s is characterised by a growing deficit of the two zones with the rest of the world. In both case also, during<lb/> the crisis exports to the rest of the world contracted before imports and intra trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>ECO/WKP(2010)67<lb/> 1.1<lb/> General principles<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> The coverage of trade in both goods and services implies the construction of two distinct<lb/> matrices, one for bilateral merchandise trade and one for bilateral trade in services which are then<lb/> aggregated. Merchandise trade still accounts for 81% of global trade and largely shapes the goods and<lb/> services matrix and its evolution over time. While the quality of the data is relatively satisfactory for<lb/> goods, statistics for exports or imports of services are not systematically available on the required bilateral<lb/> basis even for OECD countries. Consequently, a number of assumptions have to be made to complete<lb/> missing services data, using both the information given by the aggregate level of trade in goods or services<lb/> and the share of bilateral trade of merchandise in total merchandise trade.<lb/> 5.<lb/> As a rule, the matrices are completed with export series for two reasons: first, export series are<lb/> usually of much better quality and, second, import data are rarely available on a consistent free on board<lb/> basis (f.o.b.). When export data are missing, the matrices are completed with mirror series whenever<lb/> possible. A systematic procedure of cross-checking has been implemented, by comparing export/import<lb/> series with mirror data from corresponding trading partners. For OECD bilateral merchandise trade, no<lb/> substantial differences were found between export and their mirror series.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2<lb/> Data sources and methodology for compiling the goods matrix<lb/></head>

			<p>6.<lb/> There are two main international sources of bilateral merchandise trade: the data from the IMF&apos;s<lb/> Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS database, merchandise trade flows for more than 180 countries,<lb/> customs-based) and the COMTRADE database from United Nation (also customs-based). While the two<lb/> sets give comparable results for OECD countries, the quality of the data for non-OECD countries is better<lb/> in the DOTS trade statistics and when aggregated at the country level, exports and imports from the DOTS<lb/> are closer to national trade flows. The DOTS is therefore the main source used for the bilateral matrix of<lb/> goods trade flows. 5<lb/> 7.<lb/> Adjustments to the bilateral matrix to ensure that total exports and imports match national data<lb/> are detailed in Annex 2.1.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3<lb/> Data sources and methodology for compiling the services matrix<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> For bilateral trade in services, the OECD Statistics on International Trade in Services is the only<lb/> available source. Although many bilateral trade flows are missing and have to be estimated, the coverage<lb/> has substantially improved in comparison with the data used for the 2000 matrix. 6<lb/> 9.<lb/> A sub-matrix for OECD30 can be filled using the OECD Statistics on International Trade in<lb/> Services. For the missing values of bilateral trade between OECD30 countries, cells can be completed<lb/> using the relative share of merchandise trade as the corresponding weight (see Annex 2.2 for more details).<lb/> For a few countries it appears that the sum of bilateral trade flows of services is well out of line with the<lb/> 5.<lb/> COMTRADE data are however used to take into account the role of Hong Kong as a shipping port (see<lb/> below). Also data for Luxembourg and Chinese Taipei are taken from other sources.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Twelve OECD countries now have a complete breakdown of trade series (Austria, Denmark, France,<lb/> Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom)<lb/> and seven others an almost complete breakdown (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland,<lb/> Japan and Norway).<lb/> total exports or imports obtained from MEI or national sources. 7 In these cases, further adjustments have to<lb/> be made to obtain a row/column of the matrix coherent with aggregate series (see Annex 2.2). In addition,<lb/> the same database is used to complete China&apos;s trade flows with OECD30, as a relatively complete set of<lb/> mirror series for China is available. Missing values are completed as described in Annex 2.2.<lb/> 10.<lb/> For the other non-OECD countries and for Chile, Israel and Slovenia, it is not possible to use<lb/> mirror series given the paucity of data and all bilateral trade flows countries and zones have to be<lb/> estimated. The weights of merchandise trade have been applied to the matrix of services. Then adjustment<lb/> to ensure that for each country the sum of reported value is equal total services trade by country is exactly<lb/> the same as that presented for the goods matrix presented in Annex 2.1.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4<lb/> Correcting for transhipment via Hong Kong 8<lb/></head>

			<p>11.<lb/> The role of Hong Kong as a shipping port for China and other Asian countries is a source of<lb/> potential bias. Domestic exports (excluding re-exports) account for less than 5% of Hong Kong&apos;s total<lb/> exports and domestic imports (i.e. not meant to be re-exported ) account for about a quarter of Hong<lb/> Kong&apos;s total imports. The re-export trade by Hong Kong has three components: shipment of goods to<lb/> China from partner countries, shipment of Chinese goods to partner countries, and shipment of goods from<lb/> countries other than China to countries other than China. Trade flows associated with the role of Hong<lb/> Kong as a shipping port result therefore in an over-estimation of bilateral trade flows between the Dynamic<lb/> Asia region (in which Hong Kong is included) and the other countries or zones and an under-estimation of<lb/> bilateral flows between partner countries, and notably between China and other countries. In the absence of<lb/> a correction, effective exchange rates derived from the trade matrix would also be biased, with the weight<lb/> of China over-estimated in the effective exchange rate of Hong-Kong and under-estimated for all other<lb/> countries, while the weight of Hong Kong would be over-estimated in the RMB effective exchange rate<lb/> and the exchange rate of all other countries.<lb/> 12.<lb/> Re-export data are available in COMTRADE by destinations and there is some information<lb/> provided by the Hong Kong authorities on the re-export by origins. The shipment of goods from countries<lb/> other than China to countries other than China is very limited and was ignored, so that it is assumed that all<lb/> re-exports of <ref type="biblio">Hong</ref> Kong to countries other than China originated in China. The matrix has therefore been<lb/> corrected and exports from China to Dynamic Asia and exports from Dynamic Asia to other countries than<lb/> China have been reduced, and replaced by equivalent direct flows from China to other countries than<lb/> China. Exports from countries other than China to Dynamic Asia and from Dynamic Asia to China were<lb/> reduced and replaced by a flow from these countries to China. An 8 % export margin for re-exports from<lb/> China to the rest of the world and a 32% export margin for re-exports from the rest of the world to China<lb/> are assumed based on Wang et al. (2007). These changes to the matrix result in a lowering of the weight of<lb/> Dynamic Asia as a trade partner of all countries. In the case of China, after the adjustment it represents<lb/> only 12 % of exports and 26 % of imports (compared to 23 % and 37% before the adjustment<lb/> respectively).<lb/> 7.<lb/> This concerns Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. The sum of bilateral trade in services for<lb/> the United Kingdom also exceeds the aggregate number found in the balance of payments by a large<lb/> amount, particularly on the import side. This discrepancy might reflect a different treatment of financial<lb/> services.<lb/></figure>

			<p>8.<lb/> This correction is not done for other countries with important shipping and re-export activity either because<lb/> at the world level this activity remains negligible or because the data on bilateral re-exports necessary to do<lb/> the correction is not available.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Keys trends since 2000<lb/></head>

			<p>13.<lb/> The evolution of the trade matrix between the 2000 and the 2005 matrices reflects recent trends<lb/> in globalisation. First, the non-OECD share in world trade has increased markedly, from about one-quarter<lb/> to close to one-third (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). This corresponds to both an increase of trade within non-OECD zones and,<lb/> to a lesser extent, a rise in trade between OECD and non-OECD countries. The counterpart has mainly<lb/> been a decrease in NAFTA&apos;s share in world trade (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The loss of NAFTA&apos;s market share is<lb/> observed on both the export and import side. The weight of the OECD Asia Pacific zone in world trade has<lb/> also shrunk, but less markedly than the weight of NAFTA, while the weight of European countries has<lb/> slightly increased. The increase in the weight of Europe was driven not only by goods by also by a strong<lb/> increase in the share in world exports of services.<lb/></p>

			<p>14.<lb/> At the individual country level, the most important changes have been the rise in the share of<lb/> China, which has jumped from the eighth rank in world exporters and ninth rank in world importers to the<lb/> third in both between 2000 and 2005, at the expense mainly of the United States and Japan (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/> Interestingly, the increase in the share of German exports in world exports has not been a matched by<lb/> corresponding increase in the share of German imports in world imports. More details on the evolution of<lb/> the breakdown of each country&apos;s imports and exports by partner are provided in Annex 3; they show<lb/> notably the increase in share of Eastern European countries in the trade of Germany, France and Italy at the<lb/> expense of trade between these three countries.<lb/></p>

			<table>ECO/WKP(2010)67<lb/> 15.<lb/> Most of the trade of the OECD countries remains within the OECD, with about three-quarters of<lb/> the OECD imports from the OECD and a bit more of exports going to OECD partners (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Intra<lb/> OECD trade accounts for a bit more than half of world trade. A third of world trade flows are between the<lb/> OECD countries and non-OECD countries, with Asia (China and dynamic Asian Economies) the main<lb/> economic partner area of the OECD and accounting for 13.6% of the OECD total imports (close to half the<lb/> OECD imports from non-OECD countries) and 10.9% of its exports (again close half the OECD exports<lb/> outside the OECD). Trade flows between non-OECD countries account for less than 15% of world trade<lb/> flows.<lb/></p>

			<table>ECO/WKP(2010)67<lb/> 3<lb/> The main characteristics of the multilateral structure of trade<lb/> 16.<lb/> A more detailed decomposition of each country&apos;s trade partners is provided in Figures 3.1 to 3.46<lb/> which include all the 45 countries/zones covered in the 2005 trade matrix as well as the euro area OECD<lb/> members. For instance for the United States (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.1), the two upper bar charts provide an indication of<lb/> the sensitivity of each country&apos;s exports to a change in US import demand: the first one ranks countries<lb/> according to the absolute size of US demand for their exports, whereas the second one ranks countries<lb/> according to the relative importance of US demand for their exports. Thus, bar chart (a) shows that<lb/> Canada, China, Mexico and Dynamic Asia together account for just under half of US imports, while in<lb/> relative terms the second bar chart (b) shows that the United States is especially important as an export<lb/> market for both Canada and Mexico, accounting for more than three-quarters of these countries&apos; exports.<lb/> The lower bar chart (c) provides an indication of the most important markets for US exports in absolute<lb/> terms, whereas the bottom bar chart (d) shows those countries which are most reliant on US exports in<lb/> relation to their total imports. China&apos;s imports come mainly from the rest of Asia, the United States and oil<lb/> producing countries, and it accounts for more than 15% of total exports of its Asian partners (almost a<lb/> quarter of exports from non OECD dynamic Asian economies) (<ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 3.36). The United States is by far the<lb/> main export market for China and receives for about one-third of its exports. In addition Figure 3.3 shows the<lb/> same breakdown for the euro area external trade.<lb/> 17.<lb/> The panel (c) of each figure also helps compare the geographical trade diversification of each<lb/> country, highlighting the extreme cases of Canada and Mexico where more than 80% of exports go to a<lb/> single partner: the United States. On the other hand German external trade appears among the most<lb/> diversified with the two main trade partners France and the United States each accounting for only 10% of<lb/> German exports.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2010)67<lb/> BIBLIOGRAPHY<lb/> Le Fouler L., W.

			<head>WORLD imports<lb/></head>

			<p>First an initial matrix of bilateral matrix of goods trade flows between the 45 economies is built. Then<lb/> while the flows between the OECD30 countries and China do not require further adjustment, the other<lb/> parts of the matrix involving Chile, Israel and Slovenia as well as the -OECD countries other than China<lb/> has to be adjusted to ensure consistency at the world level. In particular, in the initial matrix the sum of<lb/> reported values is not equal to the total goods trade by country.<lb/> A second step consists therefore in adjusting imports from OECD30 countries and China (lower left,<lb/> Ms) and exports to OECD30 and China (upper right, Xs) by the information on total trade flows and<lb/> bilateral flows with the OECD30.<lb/></p>

			<table>9.<lb/> All the data come from DOTS statistics expect for Luxembourg where data are extracted from STATEC<lb/> and Chinese Taipei where they come from the National Board of Trade&apos;s website<lb/> (http://cus93.trade.gov.tw/english/FSCE/FSC0011E.ASP). For consistency reasons, trade with Puerto Rico<lb/> and US Virgin Islands has been integrated to trade with United States, and similarly trade with<lb/> Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion and French Guiana has been integrated to trade with France. Another<lb/> issue comes from the fact that a few countries provide only data for Belgium-Luxembourg together (or<lb/> similarly for the former Czechoslovakia) and not for individual countries separately. In this case, export<lb/> flows from these countries are adjusted and replaced by mirror series using a 1.1 CIF/FOB correction<lb/> factor.<lb/></table>

			<p>with X exports and M imports of country&apos;s (i) goods to country j .<lb/> For the lower right part of the matrix covering trade flows between non-OECD countries, Chile Israel<lb/> and Slovenia, where there is no information of correct the bilateral level of imports or exports. The<lb/> adjustment is based on the following calculations where the correction of the level is based on the import<lb/> and export weights in the trade with the OECD30 and China.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Matrix 4 left:<lb/> Matrix 4 right:<lb/> For zones, where there are intra-trade flows the diagonal is defined as:<lb/> Matrix 4 diagonal:<lb/></figure>

			<p>With this method based on the exports&apos; weights on one hand and the imports&apos; weights on the other<lb/> hand, trade flows between non-OECD countries, Chile Israel and Slovenia are underestimated. Each<lb/> coefficient in this matrix is therefore adjusted dynamically until the trade flows in the matrix are equal to<lb/> the observed total (this requires three iterations).<lb/></p>

			<head>Building the service matrix<lb/></head>

			<p>Again, OECD30 countries are treated differently from Chile, Israel and Slovenia where coverage in<lb/> Statistics on International Trade in Services is still limited.<lb/></p>

			<head>Estimations of missing data for the OECD30 sub-matrix<lb/></head>

			<p>Even for trade between OECD countries, the initial matrix derived from the OECD Statistics on<lb/> International Trade in Services is not complete. Missing values are estimated on the basis of the weight of<lb/> the 2005 goods matrix. Let&apos;s denote<lb/> the share of country&apos;s (i) goods export to country j<lb/> relative to its total export to OECD30 countries. In the simple example below, the export of services from<lb/> country 3 to country 5 is estimated the following way:<lb/></p>

			<table>Imports<lb/> OECD30 (imports)<lb/> Non OECD30 (imports)<lb/> Exports<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 8<lb/> 9<lb/> OECD30<lb/> (exports)<lb/> 1<lb/> 0<lb/> X(1,4)<lb/> 2<lb/> 0<lb/> X(2,4)<lb/> 3<lb/> X(3,1)<lb/> X(3,2)<lb/> 0<lb/> X(3,4)<lb/> ?<lb/> 4<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> X(5,4)<lb/> 0<lb/> Non-OECD30<lb/> (exports)<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 8<lb/> 9<lb/></table>

			<p>where<lb/> denotes total services export of country ) and<lb/> the exports of country i to<lb/> country j in the 2000 trade matrix.<lb/> For China, the same procedure is applied. Values for its total export and import of services are drawn<lb/> from the IMF Balance of Payment database and the bilateral trade with OECD countries from OECD<lb/> Statistics on International Trade in Services data. Before that procedure was applied, missing values were<lb/> completed according to the same methodology as described above for OECD members. In this particular<lb/> case, weights from the 2000 services matrix were used in order to avoid large distortions linked to the<lb/> dramatic changes in merchandise trade for this country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Computation of bilateral trade between non-OECD countries, Chile, Israel and Slovenia<lb/></head>

			<p>For intra non-OECD30 countries bilateral trade flows, only limited information is available and<lb/> therefore the total non-OECD30 intra-trade (excluding China) needs first to be estimated. This estimation<lb/> is carried out by using the ratio of services trade to goods trade calculated for a subset of non OECD<lb/> countries (for which such variables were available in the IMF Balance of Payments database). This ratio<lb/> multiplied by the non-OECD intra-trade in the 2005 goods matrix is taken as the estimated value for the<lb/> sub-matrix (D) above. In a second stage, each cell is completed using the bilateral weights of the<lb/> corresponding goods sub-matrix.<lb/></p>
