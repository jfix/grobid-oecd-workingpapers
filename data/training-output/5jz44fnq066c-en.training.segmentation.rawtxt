White Space Devices NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 6 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT MAIN POINTS Today, spectrum, more than ever, is identified by policy makers as a key asset to support growth in 
the Digital Economy. This report provides information and analysis on new approaches to radiofrequency 
spectrum management in OECD countries. The remarkable growth in the use of smartphones and other 
wireless devices, experienced in recent years, has increased demands on the radio spectrum throughout the 
OECD area. This is why authorities are seeking to maximise the spectrum resources made available for 
wireless communication services and to increase the efficiencies made in their use. The best way to ascertain the economic value of spectrum for wireless communication providers is to 
examine new approaches to spectrum management, including the adoption of market mechanisms, such as 
through the conduct of open and transparent auction procedures. Nonetheless, policy makers need to take 
into account a range of considerations related to overall economic, social benefits, as well as the 
preservation of critical government services derived from the use of spectrum, and these may not easily be 
determined by market prices. Virtually all sectors of the economy, from education to health care or SME 
productivity, could benefit from more widely available and efficient wireless broadband services. These 
areas increasingly use unlicensed spectrum through a variety of existing applications, such as Wireless 
Local Area Networks (WLAN, broadly called and thereinafter referred to as  " Wi-Fi networks " ), short 
range devices, and so forth. License-exempt (or unlicensed) spectrum is itself a market allocation mechanism, with no entry price 
attached but instead conditions of shared use set by administrations. This approach has proven its merits 
for a number of applications, such as Wi-Fi and these benefits may not have been achieved if traditional 
approaches and practices to the allocation and authorisation of such spectrum had been followed. 1 The 
challenge, therefore, is to make greater use of the efficiencies that market mechanisms can bring across 
both licensed and unlicensed spectrum including, where technically feasible, greater shared use. The 
enormous success of Wi-Fi networks underscores that licensed-exempt spectrum can be used extensively, 
in combination with shared and exclusive uses. Spectrum harmonisation at the global level is a desirable long-term goal that has the potential to 
enhance economies of scale for network deployment and device manufacturing. This general objective 
needs to be set against other spectrum management goals such as band harmonisation at the regional level, 
the promotion of spectrum trading and flexibility for all players to adopt innovative technological solutions 
and the protection of critical government services. It also needs to take into account other constraints such 
as international frequency co-ordination, interference mitigation and the current uses made of spectrum. The emergence of new technologies such as cognitive radio and geolocation databases enables the 
implementation of new spectrum licensing frameworks, based on the licensed or unlicensed shared use of 
spectrum. The new approaches proposed for spectrum sharing aim at maximising spectrum efficiency by 
allowing a third-party to use underutilised spectrum resources held by government and commercial users 
or by other stakeholders that do not fully exploit their spectrum capacity. Spectrum sharing through 
enhanced mechanisms may become the norm, not the exception, in the near future. Spectrum inventories offer opportunities for identifying spectrum supply, assessing its demand and 
consulting with all stakeholders on the different proposals. This could assist, together with technical 
studies, in identifying candidate bands for sharing and assessing the feasibility of deployment scenarios for 
new entrants. In that respect, spectrum inventories could be used by policy makers, following a cost-
benefit analysis, in the process towards publishing rules for spectrum use. In particular, they can assist in NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 7 highlighting underutilisation of spectrum and thus, in enabling shared use. Policy makers also need to 
tackle the existing challenges such as effective authorisation procedures that limit third party access to 
those instances where spectrum is underutilised, improved mitigation techniques for harmful interference 
and limited disruption of existing services. Incentive auctions, for example, are an innovative approach to transfer spectrum resources from less 
to more valuable uses through market mechanisms. Several factors may be critical to their success in the 
long term, such as having a sufficient amount of broadcasters willing to release spectrum or the flexibility 
to undertake the repacking process to achieve sufficiently harmonised band plans. Other countries may also 
face several constraints to conduct an incentive auction, such as the need for a regionally co-ordinated 
approach and incumbent spectrum uses. Recent technology developments may also contribute to the same 
goal by achieving greater spectrum efficiency for broadcasting services. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 8 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS INTRODUCTION: SPECTRUM AND THE INTERNET ECONOMY The unprecedented increase in the take up of smartphones and other wireless devices is leading many 
to reassess the amount of radio frequency spectrum that will be required to support future growth in the 
Internet economy. This is critical, as it will underpin the ability of OECD countries to ensure competitive 
communication markets, which will in turn drive the innovation necessary to meet broader economic and 
social development. The challenge before policy makers is how to make more spectrum available for 
space-based and terrestrial wireless communication services to meet current and future demand and, at the 
same time, achieve a more efficient use of this resource. Current developments in mobile technologies have expanded the applications of wireless broadband 
services which could, in some cases, serve as a substitute for fixed broadband (being complementary in 
most scenarios). Relevant examples are in rural or sparsely populated areas but also in providing 
competition to traditional telecommunication services as well as in the provision of new services, including 
in areas such as machine-to-machine communications. All national broadband plans in OECD countries have as a key feature the use of wireless 
technologies to complement fixed networks and as such put an emphasis on the availability of spectrum 
resources (OECD, 2011). The European Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP), for example, includes the 
action of ensuring that at least 1 200 MHz, of the radio spectrum are identified (including spectrum for 
which this has already been done) to address the increasing demand for wireless data traffic and that the 
need for additional harmonised spectrum bands is assessed. In 2007, an ITU-R report (ITU, 2012) 
estimated that between 1 280 MHz and 1 720 MHz of spectrum would be required to meet the demands of 
mobile broadband applications and services by 2020. The spectrum requirements to meet the demand need 
to be updated using the revised methodology provided by Recommendation ITU-R M.1768-1(ITU, 2013). 
Countries' needs for additional spectrum vary. The report also indicates that some countries require more 
than the 1 720 MHz of spectrum, that other countries require less than the 1 280 MHz, while other 
countries do not need any additional spectrum for these services. This report first puts into perspective the need for improved spectrum policies and why this is critical 
for the Internet economy. It does so by compiling recent studies that have been undertaken in the area of 
spectrum valuation. As the main rationale behind the reassessment of spectrum management is to facilitate 
spectrum reallocation, from less to more valuable use, the report provides an overview of some methods 
used to estimate the economic value of spectrum and, more broadly, its implications on the overall 
economy. The new approaches to spectrum management addressed in this report largely fall under two 
broad categories of initiatives: those targeted at making more spectrum resources available for wireless 
communication services, primarily mobile broadband; and those aimed at maximising spectrum efficiency. 
Broadly, three types of efficiency could be considered: dynamic (i.e. enables the use of the most innovative 
services), allocative (assigns spectrum to the undertakings that value it most) and productive (i.e. reduces 
production costs of radio-communication services). In practice, the decision making process would need to 
take into account all three types of efficiency and, in some cases, reach trade-offs between them. Further harmonisation of spectrum has been at the heart of international co-operation, and 
negotiations on this issue are on-going in international fora, including the relevant regional organisations. 
Furthermore, spectrum harmonisation makes economies of scale possible, which brings down the cost of 
deploying networks and manufacturing wireless devices, as well as facilitating roaming services and the 
mitigation of harmful cross-border interference. This plays a pivotal role in enabling the use of additional 
spectrum resources for communication services and in promoting spectrum efficiency in current or future 
spectrum bands used for those services. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 9 The increased sharing of spectrum could greatly enhance spectrum efficiency for certain services. 
Spectrum can be shared by different users, at different times, codes or geographical locations. This would, 
however, necessitate innovative licensing models that could depart from the two main licensing schemes 
that have been extremely successful to date: license-exempt and individual exclusive licenses. The new 
approaches include light-licensing models or individual licensing under certain sharing conditions that can 
allow spectrum utilisation while the incumbent user -an entity having preferential rights of use -is not 
utilising the spectrum. Other spectrum sharing models are already in place, and the permanent innovation 
in spectrum sharing scenarios provides additional opportunities for greater spectrum sharing which needs 
to overcome the reluctance from incumbents to share spectrum resources currently used for critical 
applications, such as national defence and security, transportation systems, safety-of-life and safety-of-
flight. Maximising spectrum resources for wireless communications and promoting its efficient use, needs to 
rely on a set of policy principles, such as transparency, flexibility, competition, and so forth. Spectrum 
auctions have been effectively deployed for two decades and have assisted in the allocation of spectrum 
through making greater use of the market. In that respect, incentive auctions constitute an innovative 
approach that has been proposed by the United States Federal Communications Commission as a voluntary, 
market-based tool to transfer spectrum resources from broadcasters to communication providers. It can 
play a crucial role in driving spectrum resources from less to more valuable uses, according to the 
valuation criteria of different administrations. When assessing the value of allocating spectrum bands to 
different services, policy makers need to take into account broader societal values, such as media plurality 
and cultural diversity. They should also assess the impact of spectrum management on the industry's 
competition trends. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF SPECTRUM A question that arises when policy makers consider the radio spectrum is its valuation in terms of the 
contributions its exploitation makes to economic and social development. Will, for example, the use of a 
part of the spectrum for one communication service over another provide greater value to an economy and 
better meet public policy objectives? One approach to determining the value of spectrum is to sell the right 
to make use of part of the radio spectrum, such as via an auction, or by introducing a mechanism to enable 
an existing rights holder to trade that resource. This enables the market to play a role in determining the 
fiscal value of spectrum and assist in assessing the economic valuation of any transition from one use to 
another. A market assessment of the valuation of a part of the radio spectrum will take into account many 
factors including the existence of any distortions contained in processes used for assignment. From the 
perspective of a communication service provider, the economic value of spectrum is associated with the 
revenues and financial returns achieved through the use of these resources. This can, in turn, be a function 
of factors such as regulatory conditions, competition, spectrum rights, technological development, 
propagation characteristics, assessed demand for services and so forth, as highlighted in the joint 
BEREC/RSPG report (BEREC/RSPG, 2012). The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) has also 
launched a public consultation on licensed shared access (RSPG, 2012). A non-exhaustive list of studies 
that estimate spectrum value is provided in the Annex to this report. Apart from market valuations, authorities take a further broad range of objectives into consideration 
when establishing spectrum policy. Some of these uses of the radio spectrum are potentially measurable in 
terms of valuation including by the use of market mechanisms. While it has been noted, such as in the joint 
BEREC/RSPG report, that market prices are only one factor to be taken into account in an overall 
macroeconomic assessment, market mechanisms can provide a valuable and transparent tool to be 
considered in developing spectrum policy. Virtually all sectors of the economy, from education to health NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 10 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS care or SME productivity, could benefit from more widely available and efficient wireless broadband 
services. Making sufficient spectrum available to support these requirements, therefore, is a priority for all 
policy makers while taking into account factors such as the continuity of services critical for economies 
and societies, such as use by defence and emergency services, as well as existing commitments. This 
section examines and provides an overview on measuring practices of spectrum values that can be 
quantified while reflecting broader economic and social development. 2 The economic valuation of the radio spectrum is challenging due to its inherent complexity, 
dependency on market conditions, data scarcity and forecast techniques, even though efforts have been 
made to value parts of the spectrum related to specific uses. In the United Kingdom, for example, the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
(DCMS) published a report, in 2012, which estimated the economic value of spectrum allocated to public 
communication services (e.g. mobile services, television broadcasting and so forth). The report concluded 
that public mobile communications generated a value of USD 48.7 billion in 2011, while the largest 
economic value derived from other services was USD 12.4 billion, which was produced by television 
broadcasting (BIS and DCMS, 2012). Some studies attempt to assign broader considerations in any valuation of the use of a part of the radio 
spectrum. An exercise conducted by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA), for 
example, provided an indication of the importance of spectrum to the economy and society, without 
valuing the spectrum as such. It not only predicted a total economic value (USD 14.5 billion for 2011-12), 
through the use of spectrum, but also indicated what would be the benefits in terms of employment, 
i.e. how many jobs would be added to the industry by the position it advocated (AMTA and Deloitte, 2013). 
This study made the case for additional spectrum to be made available for mobile broadband, by showing 
the social impact of mobile technologies and their importance to business. There are many studies that take a position on certain approaches to spectrum management and then 
endeavour to associate a value to pursuing that course of action. One undertaken on behalf of Microsoft 
looked at the economic value of license-exempt spectrum. It estimated that the unlicensed Wi-Fi use 
provided a consumer surplus of between USD 52 billion to USD 99 billion per annum globally, by 
enhancing the value of fixed broadband connections (Thanki, 2012). This study further estimated a further 
value of between USD 560 billion to USD 870 billion per annum in 2020 for machine-to-machine 
communications (M2M) using Wi-Fi. This approach endeavoured to assess the value of the spectrum 
allocated to a specific industry rather than the spectrum size actually allocated in the field. Other studies focus on the incremental economic value from making a specific spectrum bandwidth 
available for use by certain industries. In the case of mobile communication this could, for example, be the 
economic value of the digital dividend (e.g. the 700 MHz band in some regions). In 2010, the GSM 
Association reported an estimated economic value of USD 28.2 billion and USD 4.5 billion in the Asia-
Pacific region for the 698-806 MHz band under two scenarios (GSMA and Boston Consulting Group, 
2010). These were the allocations for mobile broadband service and to broadcasting services, including the 
estimated implications on job creation and government tax revenues. The GSMA has conducted similar 
exercises for the Asia-Pacific region with assumption of harmonisation (GSMA and Boston Consulting 
Group, 2012) and also for Latin America, reporting a much higher value generated from mobile services 
than from broadcasting in those regions (GSMA/AHCIET, 2011). In addition, a GSMA report assessed the 
incremental benefits from sharing spectrum in the 2.3 GHz and the 3.5 GHz band in the European Union 
and the United States, considering licensed shared access for mobile network operators (GSMA, Deloitte 
and Real Wireless, 2014). NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 11 If an analysis is based on the economic welfare gains, for use of spectrum by different sectors, in 
terms of their percentage contribution to GDP, for a given country or region, the estimations can, of course, 
vary. These can, for example, range from 0.03% (AMTA, 2009) to 2.04% (GSMA/Plum Consulting, 2013) 
per annum if used for mobile services, and from 0.05% (GSMA/AHCIET, 2011) to 0.93% (MPA and 
JIMCA, 2012) if used for broadcasting purposes. The differences between those results can be partly 
attributed to the variety of market situations in different countries or regions, and also to differences in 
methodology or in the concept of economic value itself. From this perspective, it can be noted that 
different concepts of economic value may be used by different studies or even within the same report. In 
that respect, there seem to be at least three broad categories of approaches taken to measure the value: 
economic welfare, economic contribution, and productivity increase, as illustrated below. Economic welfare The economic welfare approach is based on classical microeconomic theory that seeks to estimate the 
sum of economic surplus gained by consumers, producers and governments. This is often called  " social 
welfare "  despite only including surpluses accrued in markets and measured in monetary terms. This report 
refers to this as  " economic welfare "  to underline that it does not fully address social value. Economic 
welfare is usually composed of consumer and producer surplus. The former is a measure of the difference 
between each user's willingness to pay for a specific service and its actual price. Accordingly, producer 
surplus accounts for the gap between the price paid and the lowest price at which the seller would be 
willing to sell (typically the marginal production cost). The sum of producer and consumer surpluses 
provides the overall benefit from a service provided in the market, such as for mobile communication 
service and broadcasting. From the perspective of telecommunication policy, this approach is particularly meaningful in that it 
includes both the benefits from lower prices and of additional subscribers of a given service that requires 
spectrum, while at the same time reflecting the providers' benefit related to their profits. As economic 
welfare is measured and estimated only for a specific single market, additional work will be required if 
policy makers wish to take into account external benefits. These benefits could, for example, be those in 
related markets (e.g. accrued in the mobile applications market as a result of a larger mobile 
communication market) or for the whole economy (e.g. increased growth or productivity rates as a result of 
mobile service provision). This is why welfare gains restricted to a specific market could widely differ 
from the overall welfare gain. In practical terms, assessing consumer surplus requires an estimation of consumers' willingness to 
pay, or consumer demand. Given that consumer surplus is the difference between this number and the 
actual price paid, it would be unrealistic to ask consumers about their willingness to pay directly. Hence, 
some techniques have been developed to enable estimates to be made. The BIS/DCMS study in United 
Kingdom tackled this challenge by assuming a linear consumer demand curve and estimating a  " choke 
price " , at which no consumer would subscribe, that being a demand equal to zero. Although this type of 
estimation still requires survey-based research on consumers to find out the choke price, in addition to 
information on actual prices paid and quantities provided (e.g. subscription numbers) it may represent a 
viable method to measure consumer surplus. Some approaches do not aim at measuring the economic value of spectrum but at estimating consumer 
surplus in telecommunications markets. A further approach is one that estimates the lower bound for a 
consumer's willingness to pay by assuming that anyone who adopts a service (e.g. broadband), at a given 
point in time, would be willing to pay the same subscription price in subsequent years. If communication 
prices decrease over time, the sum of these price differences would provide an estimation of consumer 
surplus. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 12 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS Producer surplus can be estimated from data on revenues and costs incurred by communication 
providers. Costs are, however, challenging to estimate for several reasons. First, future costs in response to 
future increases of demand are challenging to predict, given the existence of fixed costs spread across 
several functions or areas of firms, or even across different services. The United Kingdom study used 
Analysis Mason's internal databases in addition to the operators' annual reports to estimate their costs. 
Other studies do not measure producer surplus and, instead, adopt a different approach, such as assessing 
consumer surplus only. Notwithstanding this, the report carried out for the United Kingdom, noted that 
over 80% of economic welfare came from consumer surplus both for mobile communications and 
broadcasting. If authorities are unable to estimate the producer surplus, other indicators may be used as a 
reference, such as revenues or spectrum market prices. Economic contribution A further approach to spectrum valuation aims to measure the total value added to the economy in the 
course of industrial production processes or an industry's value chain. The strength of this approach is that 
it can provide very clear and concrete figures showing how much value, as a result of service provision, 
can be translated to a percentage of GDP and partly delivered to employees. One of the approaches to measure GDP is the aggregated value added of the different industries of an 
economy. This can also take into account the indirect contribution to an economy realised by other 
industries. If a mobile operator purchases equipment, for example to expand its coverage as a result of a 
spectrum allocation, the demand for that equipment increases and is conducive to an additional value 
added in equipment sales. This is in addition to the value added from mobile service provision. Similar 
contributions from third party services provided by a mobile network can be also counted to capture a 
broader scope of the economic impact of the mobile ecosystem. On the other hand, this approach does not 
cover benefits for consumers except for a very indirect effect of income increase brought about by the 
service provision (if such an effect is estimated), so there is a risk that low subscription numbers and high 
prices may be identified as a positive outcome. A further and relevant consideration is the substantial 
effects on the whole economy caused by productivity increases over time. To sum up, the economic contribution approach is attractive if policy makers wish to stimulate the 
economy and increase GDP by activating unused capacity, of an economy, through spectrum allocation. 
Finally, though unlikely in the OECD area, it has been suggested that the total value added measured by 
this approach may not be related to living standards when there is little capacity (such as unused labour or 
capital) available in an economy. From a practical point of view, this approach provides a fairly simple estimation method as it utilises 
input-output tables that are usually available for most countries. These record the inputs and outputs of 
specific sectors of the economy. Nonetheless, when estimating indirect effects on other industries in 
addition to direct effects, it is necessary to identify which industries provided intermediate inputs for the 
use of the spectrum that enables the communication service. This information gathering process may need 
co-operation from mobile service providers as it may require additional information or assumptions. 
Challenges are also expected if the approach intends to include value added from third party services. Productivity increase A further approach would consist of measuring growth as a result of the adoption of services using 
spectrum resources, in that the use of these services leads to a larger economic output (GDP), capital and 
labour being equal. For example, an employee may deliver a higher output by using his time more 
effectively by using mobile communications. A company may replace some computers with smartphones 
and thus reduce the capital stock devoted to purchasing computers. The difference from the contribution NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 13 approach noted above is that the productivity approach attempts to estimate external effects on GDP 
growth that would be realised in the long-term. Although productivity does not affect consumers directly, 
lower service prices enabled by the use of spectrum may increase adoption of services and increase a 
firm's productivity. This would in turn boost income per capita, which could eventually benefit consumers 
in a competitive market. This approach may, however, be the most challenging to assess among the three proposed in this 
section. In Australia, a study estimated the value derived from productivity increases by using a private 
data source and an internal economic model with several assumptions and scenarios (AMTA and Deloitte, 
2013). Studies undertaken by the GSMA for the Asia-Pacific region predicted productivity improvements 
by estimating future Internet adoption rates and their impact on agriculture, services and manufacturing 
sectors. These methodologies may entail some complexities and can be difficult to replicate with only 
publicly available information. Over recent years, there has been extensive research on the effects of ICTs on productivity. By way of 
example, an OECD review of existing literature concluded that the productivity effect is not only 
significant but also increasing over time (Kretschmer, 2012). One such study, undertaken by Gruber and 
Koutroumpis in 2010, estimated that mobile communications contributed 0.39% per annum to GDP growth 
in the OECD area (Gruber and Koutroumpis, 2010). Nevertheless, a study undertaken in the United States 
lists a number of references that provide estimates on the macroeconomic performance caused by ICT 
adoption, by also pointing out that it may be premature to ascertain the productivity effects of wireless 
broadband services (Sosa and van Audenrode, 2011). ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF SPECTRUM HARMONISATION The harmonisation of spectrum bands has significant economic implications for policy makers to 
consider. While the choices made by individual countries go beyond the scope of this report, there are 
economic implications resulting from those choices. Spectrum harmonisation is a desirable goal for all types of radio communication services that 
increases economies of scale for equipment and simplifies assignment procedures. Nevertheless, spectrum 
harmonisation may be at odds with other policy objectives, such as favouring flexibility by, for example, 
promoting spectrum trading, or taking due account of specific domestic circumstances (e.g. historical band 
allocations and incumbent uses) in relation to spectrum planning and management. Innovation in wireless 
technologies may also be, to some extent, limited by a lack of flexibility in  " band plans "  and technical 
conditions. On the other hand, these conditions may be strongly desirable to achieve economies of scale 
and certainty for investment for all players. For example, the opportunities for flexibility originally 
proposed by the European Commission (WAPECS approach) in the 2.6 GHz band in Europe have not been 
implemented, as market players preferred to adopt the stable CEPT harmonised band plan which they 
thought would provide a higher certainty for their investment. Even though new wireless technologies, such as LTE, allow a more flexible use of the different 
spectrum bands, compared to 2G (GSM) or 3G (UMTS and CDMA2000) technologies, which avoid 
spectrum fragmentation, the importance of harmonisation is increasingly significant. According to the 
GSMA's Wireless Intelligence, by 2015 there will be 200 live LTE networks, deployed over 38 different 
spectrum frequency combinations. 3 This will raise device interoperability issues and may result in 
spectrum fragmentation. It could reduce the benefits of economies of scale and increase equipment costs, 
which may result in end-users in certain areas being excluded from the most recent developments in 
wireless technologies. Moreover, consumers and businesses benefit from cross-country roaming when 
travelling or doing business abroad. As such, further harmonisation is desirable with notable economic NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 14 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS benefits. For a business this could be, for example, in better improving the management of a fleet. Globally, 
policy makers could identify one or more candidate bands for global interoperability. A very recent example of these concerns, triggered by the strategy of some device manufacturers, is 
the inability of users in many European and Asian countries to use LTE services on some iPhone devices. 
This is because, for some devices, the iPhone's LTE connectivity does not cover the 800 MHz and 2.6 
GHz bands, used for LTE in many European countries. Moreover, Apple has manufactured three different 
iPhone models, supporting different bands, which could make carrier switching and international roaming 
more challenging. Other leading device manufacturers made a different choice and supported the European 
800 MHz and 2.6 GHz harmonised bands for LTE, which have the advantage of being relatively wide. Spectrum harmonisation: A desirable goal with many hurdles No one denies, of course, the benefits of spectrum harmonisation. Few would argue against existing 
incentives to achieve economies of scale and simplify device manufacturing. Nonetheless, there are many 
different obstacles to changing current spectrum uses. These can be, for example, the costs in migration of 
incumbent systems that may be challenging to move in related policy areas such as national defence and 
security, transportation systems or navigation tools. Spectrum harmonisation is fully related to the spectrum management approach chosen. For example, 
allowing spectrum trading (e.g. rights of use) and more autonomous management of spectrum by assignees 
could potentially be counterproductive for spectrum harmonisation in the medium or long term, as band 
segmentation plans for licensed spectrum would not be harmonised. Nevertheless, some argue that 
allowing market forces to work more efficiently could potentially help achieve band harmonisation more 
rapidly, while others say that harmonisation, when technical parameters are kept to a minimum, should not 
prevent flexibility. Spectrum trading, increased shared use of spectrum and technology neutrality may not 
necessarily lead to spectrum harmonisation and economies of scale for equipment, but quite the contrary. 
Historical band assignments may also be a challenge towards greater harmonisation. Harmonising spectrum at a regional or global level usually includes the following tasks: i) 
reaching agreements on the lower and upper edge of band covered; ii) 
guard band definition or, generally speaking, the band's segmentation; iii) the technology and duplexing techniques that may be used in each of the segments/blocks 
of the bands (e.g. FDD, TDD); iv) arrangements to provide interference protection from adjacent blocks or bands; v) 
re-allocation and re-planning of existing users and services; vi) channelling; vii) other technical conditions judged necessary to allow service operation in a given band, 
including sharing conditions, and so forth. These measures aimed at harmonisation are important in that they provide certainty for equipment 
makers and operators to foresee and assess forthcoming investment. They also facilitate the role of 
spectrum administrations in co-ordinating frequencies with neighbouring countries and undertake spectrum 
planning on a long-term basis. Nevertheless, harmonisation measures can involve a high degree of NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 15 complexity, as the introduction of harmonised conditions and procedures need to be co-ordinated among 
the different countries, usually under a common time schedule. Some believe harmonisation measures could preclude further technological innovations in a band or, 
more broadly, flexible use of spectrum. Flexibility – enabled by limited harmonisation – may have some 
advantages as well. For instance, in markets where there is more demand for wireless broadband services, 
carriers may be able to deploy their own solutions and technologies and maximise capacity or delivery 
times in these areas. At the same time, there could be more freedom for new technologies to be tested 
and/or adopted than would be the case when observing harmonised technical conditions and band plans. 
There seems to be, however, a relatively general consensus that the benefits of harmonisation offset those 
of flexibility. Spectrum harmonisation is not only important for the provision of commercial communication services, 
including radio and television broadcasting. It also plays a key role in the provision of public services, such as 
emergency services (designated as PPDR -Public Protection and Disaster Relief -by the ITU or in Europe or 
Public Safety in the United States). These are an example of broader societal benefits resulting from 
harmonised spectrum (WIK-Consult, 2010). For example, recent requests for harmonisation of emergency 
services in the United States or the European Union area confirm this assessment. Some degree of 
harmonised spectrum would enable enhanced interaction between emergency agencies in neighbouring 
countries, using interoperable bands and procedures that enable roaming, for tasks such as natural disaster 
responses. As for other spectrum uses, it would also enhance economies of scale for equipment used in the 
provision of emergency services. Common radiofrequency spectrum will advance international aid during 
disasters and major events. International and regional harmonisation will improve interoperability among first 
responders and drive suitable devices and standards dedicated to broadband PPDR. The role of the industry Standardisation plays a key role in addressing technology constraints on band harmonisation. 
International standards bodies such as the ETSI, IEEE, ISO, ITU-T or 3GPP respond to requests from 
industry and develop standards for radiocommunications. The ability of these bodies to respond quickly to 
these requests clearly determines the way forward regarding the use of common band plans and technical 
requirements for emerging technologies or in discussions for harmonising certain spectrum bands. In addition to standardisation, mobile operators and equipment manufacturers may clearly benefit 
from increased band harmonisation. According to the GSMA, the additional manufacturing costs due to 
spectrum fragmentation amount to USD 15 per device for a production of 8 million units, USD 1.5 for 80 
million and USD 0.15 for 800 million devices, subject to certain assumptions (GSMA, 2007). There are, 
however, several precisions to be made in this respect. In some cases, industry-driven harmonisation may 
be based on economies of scale that may not be spectrum efficient, or at least in some countries or regions. 
For example, if a given band segmentation plan is flexible enough for equipment makers to achieve 
economies of scale it may rather involve some efficiency losses in some regions, which may be justified by 
lower equipment costs. A different, related issue is the timing of deployments in a given band, which may impose serious 
restrictions on equipment manufacturers and operators when accommodating future band segmentations or 
technical requirements. If early deployments in a given band have involved important investments in 
designing, developing and testing equipment, there may be a strong opposition if further technical 
proposals are not fully compatible with the initial deployment. Interoperability issues may also have 
important implications in addition to economies of scale, as policy makers may want to improve consumer 
switching or guarantee that smaller providers have a fair choice of equipment possibilities. An example for 
this is the 700 MHz interoperability issues in the United States, described below. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 16 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS Finally, the industry clearly has a prominent role in putting forward proposals for harmonising bands 
on a regional or global level. Industry players may first seek to harmonise neighbouring bands of those 
already used for mobile communications, as this may impose lighter constraints on developing new 
equipment. These bands also facilitate new deployments for mobile communications and enable easier 
sharing or upgrading of existing sites. Equipment manufacturers also face limitations in the number of 
lower frequency bands (under 1 GHz) that a single device can support. An example: The 700 MHz band The 700 MHz band may be the most telling example of harmonisation efforts leading to a series of 
band segmentation standards. This is because it is perceived to address many of the future requirements for 
wireless broadband spectrum. The 700 MHz band was at the heart of the discussions at the International 
Telecommunications Union's (ITU) World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-12) and will be 
prominent at the upcoming WRC-15. Known as the  " digital dividend "  band in many countries (e.g. 
Australia, Mexico and the United States), and the second  " digital dividend "  in Europe, it has been targeted 
for future mobile communications use. Its favourable propagation characteristics make it ideal for 
extending coverage in rural areas and increasing indoor reception while reducing investment in mobile 
network deployments, as fewer base stations are needed to cover a given area. Different regions and/or countries of the world have proposed different band plans for the digital 
dividend in the 700 MHz and/or 800 MHz bands (Figure 1). While countries from the European 
Conference for Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have allocated the 790-862 MHz 
band for mobile communication (digital dividend), the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) designed a 
different band plan for the 700 MHz band (698-806 MHz). The Inter-American Telecommunications 
Commission (CITEL) adopted a recommendation for CITEL administrations that wish to deploy 
broadband networks to meet PPDR needs in the 700 MHz band, and consider the bands 703-748/758-803 
MHz and 758-768/788-798 MHz. The WRC-12 allocated the 700 MHz band for mobile use, on a co-
primary basis, effective after the WRC-2015 in Region 1, so that it could either be allocated to 
broadcasting or mobile communication services (in Region 1 the 790-862 MHz band had been identified 
for IMT-2000 at the WRC-07). At the next WRC (WRC-2015), the ITU will have to decide on the lower 
edge of this allocation, currently at 694 MHz for Region 1. The ITU has also proposed different 
segmentation plans for the 700 MHz band in its Recommendation ITU-R M.1036, namely proposing five 
alternatives (A1 to A5). In view of these alternatives, different regions have chosen different segmentation 
plans (e.g. CEPT for the 800 MHz band, APT and CITEL for the 700 MHz band). Figure 1. Digital dividend band plans (700 MHz/800 MHz) Source: GSMA, Digital Dividend Toolkit. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 17 At the March 2013 meeting of the CEPT's Electronic Communications Committee, a number of 
countries voiced calls to consider studies on a long-term vision for the UHF broadcasting band. 4 This has 
been prompted by the WRC-15 agenda Item 1.1 (additional spectrum allocations to the mobile service to 
facilitate the development of terrestrial mobile broadband), which has discussed proposals for the ITU-R to 
consider a further mobile allocation in the 470-694 MHz spectrum. Current work at the CEPT includes 
studies to support the development of a long-term vision of the UHF band in Europe. This would take into 
account broadcasting spectrum needs, wireless broadband and other applications such as PMSE, and issues 
surrounding the efficiency of the European approach to the UHF band. 5 Mexico has been one the countries that has adopted the APT band plan for 700 MHz after evaluating 
the different possibilities, such as being more aligned with that of the United States and Canada or the 
possibility of achieving larger economies of scale (COFETEL, 2012). Bearing in mind the discussions that 
are being held in the United States and Canada regarding the band's interoperability and, especially, the 
larger uplink and downlink bands of the segmentation plan proposed by the APT, Mexico has decided to 
go forward with the APT band plan. The significant development of LTE technologies in Asian markets, 
such as China, where most of the world's population lives, is likely to enhance the economies of scale of 
device makers and lower the end price of devices for those countries adopting this plan. The Mexican regulator, Cofetel, has undertaken technical studies to estimate the time required to 
deploy a wireless network using the APT and the United States band plans, drawing the conclusion that the 
time required for deployment would be at least 1.5 times longer if using the United States band plan, initial 
investment would be 5.6 times higher and mobile carriers would need to deploy 4.5 times more radio 
stations. Nevertheless, given that the United States and Mexico share a land border, required co-ordination 
needs to take place to address potential harmful interference between emissions in border areas of both 
countries. Based on the benefits of the APT band plan, together with the co-ordination costs for the United 
States/Mexico border, Mexico has decided that the APT plan remains the preferable option. A further challenge that countries face when assessing the use of the 700 MHz for mobile 
communications services is the bandwidth needed by broadcasting services, even though the technological 
evolution of broadcasting standards (e.g. DVB-T2, MPEG4, HEVC) or increased multiplexing rations may 
partly address these concerns. Another challenge may be other incumbent users of this band in some 
countries, such as programme making and special events applications (PMSE). More generally, a number of issues need to be considered when governments design band plans and 
technical conditions for a given band (Box 1). Economies of scale arising from regional and global 
standards are an important criterion, but they have to be balanced against other constraints, such as 
possible interference with other services in neighbouring bands, international co-ordination of frequencies 
between neighbouring countries and existing allocations or deployments in a given country. For the latter 
case, the existence of public emergency services deployed in a certain band, which are costly to migrate, 
may be a strong reason for a country to prefer one band plan over another. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 18 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS Box 1. Australia's 700 MHz band harmonisation In June 2010, the Australian Government announced that it would release 126 MHz of broadcasting spectrum 
between 694 MHz and 820 MHz as a digital dividend. Subsequent to this decision, the Australian Communications 
and Media Authority (ACMA) commenced preparing the spectrum for sale. A critical part of this work was to decide 
the fundamental band plan upon which the new spectrum licences would be based. As a technology-taker with a 
comparatively small population, harmonisation is a key driver in Australia's international spectrum engagements. In considering the optimal band plan for Australia, the ACMA identified a number of priorities, including: selecting a 
band plan that would maximise efficiency and utility of the spectrum -with a key objective being the ability of the 
frequency arrangements to provide for channels of up to 20 MHz (desirable for Long Term Evolution (LTE) 
technology), as well as realisation of the benefits of economies of scale and roaming through spectrum harmonisation. The ACMA considered these priorities against existing digital dividend band plans. While the United States digital 
dividend (698–806 MHz) frequency range largely aligns with Australia's, the United States 700 MHz band plan did 
not meet Australia's objective of providing channels up to 20 MHz or maximise efficiency to the extent desired by 
Australia (because of its interleaved small blocks of spectrum, requiring more guard bands than a single contiguous 
block and making handset design more complex). The European band plan was also considered, but was found to be 
unsuitable for Australia as there is only a partial overlap (790–820 MHz) between the European and Australian digital 
dividend frequency ranges. For the first time, a specific Asia-Pacific harmonised digital dividend band plan was considered. Australia, led by the 
ACMA, was a key driver in this undertaking, working with other Region Three countries within the Asia-Pacific 
Telecommunity Wireless Group (AWG) to develop the band plans. There are two Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) 700 MHz plans, one for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) 
technologies and one for Time Division Duplex (TDD) technologies. The APT band plans were refined over a period 
of two years, during which time numerous related studies were conducted (including band edge studies), before being 
finally agreed in September 2011. Both band plans have been adopted as part of the LTE standard by the international 
3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and maximise efficient use of the spectrum. Australia has adopted the FDD version of the APT band plan, which identifies two 45 MHz segments of paired 
spectrum within 703–803 MHz, optimised for mobile broadband. It offers the opportunity for significant economies 
of scale, enabling cheaper devices and international roaming benefits. APT FDD 700 MHz plan The ACMA has been working to promote the APT band plan throughout Region 2 and Region 3, with a large number 
of countries across the Asia–Pacific region now committed to, or seriously considering, its adoption. Currently, some 
20 countries including Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New 
Guinea and Singapore, have announced adoption of the plan or variants of it that will retain much, if not all, of the 
harmonisation benefits. Other APT countries such as Cambodia and Thailand are all also actively considering the 
adoption of the APT band plan. Outside of the APT community, major interest in the APT plan has been shown by 
African and Middle Eastern countries. Numerous Latin American countries have adopted, or indicated an intention to 
adopt, the plan including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Guam, Panama, Peru and 
Venezuela. The plan also has the potential to influence consideration on the use of the 700 MHz band for mobile in 
ITU Region 1, which includes Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Russia. This issue is agenda item 1.2 for the 2015 
World Radiocommunications Conference. The APT 700 MHz band plan has the opportunity to be the most highly harmonised band for mobile broadband 
internationally and offers the potential for markets of several hundreds of millions of subscribers. The resulting 
economies of scale for APT band plan-compliant devices are expected to be substantial, with corresponding economic 
and consumer benefits. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 19 An example of the complexities of achieving a harmonised band at the national level and the 
associated interoperability requirements is the 700 MHz band in the United States (Box 2). Box 2. Cost and benefits of a harmonised band at national level In 2012, the FCC sought comment on the possibility of promoting interoperability in the lower 700 MHz band (FCC, 
2012). According to the United States band plan, the 700 MHz band is comprised of 108 MHz of spectrum: 70 MHz 
of commercial, non-guard band spectrum, 24 MHz of public safety spectrum, 10 MHz of spectrum to be reallocated 
for public safety use, and 4 MHz of guard band spectrum. The lower 700 MHz spectrum band contains 48 MHz of 
spectrum, divided into five spectrum blocks (A to E). In turn, the 3GPP has developed standards for LTE in the lower 
700 MHz band, namely in two different 3GPP operating band classes in order to address interference issues (A block 
is adjacent to the television channel 51, and exclusion zones in the uplink are adjacent to potential high power uses in 
the E block on the downlink): Band Class 12 and Band Class 17. Band Class 12 covers the lower A, B and C blocks, 
and is held by Verizon and small carriers. Band class 17 covers the lower B and C blocks, where AT&T has a 
significant spectrum holding. A number of lower A block licensees argued that, as a consequence of economies of 
scale, equipment makers had little incentive to provide equipment for them to operate in these bands. They also 
argued that there was no technical reason, from an interference perspective, for the existence of Band Class 17. The 
supporters of Band Class 17 filtering argued that it was needed to tackle potential interference with TV Channel 51 
and high power E block operations. In particular, the proponents of interoperability in the lower 700 MHz bands seek to freeze the distribution of any 
equipment not capable of accommodating all band plans in the lower 700 MHz band (hence those supporting Band 
Class 17 only would be banned from the market), so that all devices operating in this band would be interoperable, in 
the sense that they would all operate on all the lower 700 MHz spectrum blocks. The main opponents to the 
interoperability obligation, AT&T and Verizon, as well as device manufacturers such as Qualcomm and the 
manufacturers association TIA, argued that interoperability does not fix the interference problem, that it could delay 
the deployment process and increase device cost. They also argued that requiring interoperability would have 
undermined future investment in 3GPP standards, and that the current standards are technologically sound. On 10 September 2013, a number of the principal wireless providers licensed in the band, along with the Competitive 
Carriers Association, announced a voluntary industry solution that would resolve the lack of interoperability in the 
Lower 700 MHz band. On 25 October 2013, the FCC adopted an order that took steps to implement the industry 
solution, based on its finding that the voluntary agreement would serve the public interest by encouraging the efficient 
use of spectrum and enabling consumers to enjoy the benefits of greater competition. The Commission's order 
addressed interference concerns raised in the proceeding by modifying the technical rules for the D and E blocks, so 
as to remove the likelihood of harm caused by attendant power levels while continuing to allow high-value uses of 
these blocks. The order concluded that interference from adjacent channel 51 operations was unlikely to disturb B 
and C block operations and was not an impediment to interoperability. The order proposed to modify AT&T's B and 
C block licenses to incorporate AT&T's commitments to help achieve lower 700 MHz interoperability and made 
changes to construction requirements and deadlines for A, B. and E block licensees. While this issue was resolved by a complicated, multi-part voluntary agreement that provides for interoperability, the 
episode nonetheless clearly illustrates the complexities of achieving device interoperability, as well as the technical 
and economic and country-and band-specificity of the issues. Lack of interoperability can slow device production 
and reduce economies of scale, while leaving the smaller carriers with fewer device options to choose, which 
eventually harm consumers. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 20 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS Regional vs. global harmonisation Spectrum harmonisation may take place at the global (e.g. ITU) or the regional level (e.g. CEPT, 
APT/CITEL, the European Union), in addition to band harmonisation within a country (which may be 
important for larger countries) or bilateral talks to ensure spectrum compatibility across borders. All three 
levels impose constraints on the whole process. For example, some regions, such as the European Union 
area or, more broadly, the CEPT, may pursue regional harmonisation plans so that interference mitigation 
is facilitated by ensuring that all countries in that region undertake spectrum transition at the same time. Regional economic unions, such as the European Union, may have broader economic objectives such 
as pursuing a single market, which would be significantly favoured by harmonised band plans. In this 
respect, the European Union and the CEPT work closely to assist each other in bringing forward greater 
harmonisation in Europe. For example, the CEPT received the mandate from the European Commission to 
develop technical conditions for the use of the 700 MHz band by wireless broadband and emergency 
services, which will have to be ready for 2015. In particular, CEPT was mandated to develop a preferred 
technical arrangement and to identify common and minimal (least restrictive) technical conditions for 
wireless broadband use in this band, subject to a precise definition of the lower band edge, to avoid 
interference in adjacent bands (in compliance with the harmonised conditions for the 800 MHz), and to 
facilitate cross-border co-ordination. In order to guarantee broader policy goals such as the accomplishment of the single market, some 
bands are harmonised at the European level by the European Commission (assisted by the CEPT), to allow 
for a co-ordinated approach in terms of technical conditions and migration paths. Even though this may 
delay migration to new uses in some countries, the above-mentioned benefits prevail and support regional 
spectrum harmonisation in some cases. As noted above, there is currently no clear globally agreed policy 
as to favouring regional over global harmonisation, even though global harmonisation is a long-term 
desirable goal and regional and national harmonisation a suboptimal outcome. Advancing regional harmonisation may also help leverage a higher bargaining power in international 
negotiations. As some have noted (NTIA, 2008) the adoption of globally harmonised bands may be an 
option for some countries, notably the largest economies, while a must for others. Despite larger countries 
having this possibility, increased recognition of the benefits of band harmonisation is taking place 
worldwide. In the United States, the PCAST report notes, for example, that this country should make 
international harmonisation of spectrum allocations to wireless broadband, particularly in bands used or 
planned to be used for mobile broadband communications, a key element of its future position at WRC-15 
and in bilateral and regional discussions with its own neighbours, Mexico and Canada. Despite this rising trend, band harmonisation negotiations and migration are lengthy processes, which 
may take many years to negotiate, develop and implement, and that need to consider many of the existing 
constraints such as incumbent uses, interference from neighbouring bands and international co-ordination. SHARED USE OF SPECTRUM: DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT APPROACHES An additional way to maximise spectrum efficiency This report examines a number of ways to increase the amount of spectrum resources available for 
communication services and related uses, including by increasing its efficiency. In that respect, spectrum 
sharing seeks to better exploit a part of this resource that may be underutilised or with innovative 
approaches could be exploited to a greater extent. Spectrum sharing is already being used in some cases 
and is constantly innovating. To accomplish this goal there is a need to examine regulatory instruments that 
may not have been fully exploited to date and that may address some of the current challenges associated NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 21 with the increasing demand for spectrum. Shared use of spectrum, whether license-exempt or licensed, is 
already widely utilised in some circumstances (e.g. Wi-Fi networks, wireless microphones, private mobile 
radio, fixed service), but there is a growing advocacy for such opportunities to cover some specific bands 
that are now used for other services and to raise the awareness of policy makers on the opportunities 
created by spectrum sharing. An element in these discussions is, however, whether spectrum sharing is authorised in a license-
exempt or licensed environment (including through light licensing), as both approaches have pros and cons. 
Traditionally, mobile operators have argued for a fully licensed, exclusive use of spectrum as a basis to 
underpin their business models and provide legal certainty. On the other hand, in the area of proximity 
networks, the benefits of license-exempt use (i.e. general authorisation in some jurisdictions) have proved a 
tremendous success enabling applications such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and wireless microphones (Benkler, 
2012). Mobile operators themselves widely use Wi-Fi offloading techniques to optimise the performance 
of their networks (OECD, 2013, WIK-Consult, 2013). Wi-Fi is now embedded in all smartphones and 
tablets. The established practice is that indoor coverage in mobile networks is provided through outdoor base 
stations (macro cells) but the fundamental problem is that most mobile broadband capacity is consumed 
indoors and/or within the local area. This suggests that some frequencies could be shared to provide indoor 
capacity at the local area level, for example through femto-cells. This requires network sharing 
management, and thus the use of a combination of different types of spectrum licensing approaches 
simultaneously. Whatever approach is favoured, this report starts from the assumption that careful spectrum 
inventories could be undertaken in order to assess possible spectrum supply to accommodate new 
applications and, against policy goals, the possibilities of shared use in each of the bands, in light of current 
uses. This assessment can be based on different scenarios depending on the applications that require access 
to the spectrum. Authorised shared access/licensed shared access (ASA/LSA), as defined in this section 
may become an increasing opportunity to accommodate new spectrum capacity needs, provided that a 
balanced approach and sufficient certainty are provided for all stakeholders involved. 6 Another very 
important benefit from spectrum inventories is a clear picture of the extent to which spectrum resources are 
being actually utilised, which could highlight opportunities for sharing. The practical implementation of 
spectrum inventories needs to be carefully assessed, as they can become relatively complex and involve 
onerous implications for regulators and licensees. In any event, a detailed implementation plan and a cost-
benefit analysis could be undertaken. In this new environment, rights and obligations of each type of spectrum user could be clearly defined. 
First, the new licensing environment (or license-exempt) must be backed by spectrum compatibility 
evidence and scenario-based analysis of the possible licensing frameworks. In addition, any possible 
implementation of shared use of spectrum may have to be aligned with other spectrum policy goals, such 
as spectrum harmonisation of bands at a regional, or even global level, to enhance economies of scale. In 
that respect, for example, opening a band for license-exempt use may undermine efforts to clear and 
harmonise a given band for exclusive licensed use. Which licensing regime? Beyond the overarching principles to which spectrum policy should adhere, such as observing, to the 
extent possible, technological and service neutrality, ensuring the highest degree of legal certainty for 
market players and other stakeholders, or providing transparent, clear conditions for the use of spectrum 
resources, the reality is that spectrum licensing schemes do not always achieve these goals. Clearly, history 
and legacy regulation play a role as does regulatory inertia or resistance to change. The overall situation NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 22 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS becomes increasingly complex as spectrum is a strategic asset for governments, with far-reaching 
implications on national security, defence and the provision of basic public services, such as emergency 
assistance. Nonetheless, spectrum regimes in OECD countries evolve and adapt to new technologies as 
well as the need to accommodate market mechanisms to promote the more efficient use of spectrum. Traditionally, the role of government in spectrum management can be categorised into three major 
approaches: i) command and control; ii) market mechanisms; and iii) license exemption. As a matter of 
fact, these three approaches are not mutually exclusive, nor are their designations fully accurate or 
mutually exclusive, but they serve the purpose of a broad categorisation of recent spectrum management. 
For example, license exemption is subject to complying with some regulations, i.e. on transmitter and 
receiver power limits, whereby individual licensing schemes do incorporate some market mechanisms, 
such as trading of rights of use. Market mechanisms include spectrum trading, which plays a significant 
role in the United States wireless market but has not been very successful elsewhere to date, especially in 
Europe (with some exceptions such as the trade of rights of use in the 3.5 GHz band by operators and local 
authorities in France). The Electronic Communications Committee of the CEPT provides a different categorisation of these 
approaches, based on the licensing schemes, focusing on the requirements of the authorisations/licenses 
granted for the use of spectrum (Table 1). Table 1. Regulatory options towards spectrum licensing Individual authorisation

Notification Source: OECD, based on ECO (ECC Report 132) Policy makers are recommended to not only pursue one option towards maximising the amount of 
spectrum available for communications and its efficiency. This report encourages them to advance 
initiatives in different areas, while ensuring consistency. One of these approaches is the shared use of 
spectrum, whereby several users may have access to the same spectrum resources, on a license-exempt 
(unlicensed) or licensed basis. There are several approaches between a pure  " command and control "  model, i.e. a traditional 
licensing scheme, and license-exempt use of spectrum. Unlicensed bands also involve requirements, such 
as standard compliance, as the devices may not cause harmful interference nor request protection against 
interference. Wi-Fi technologies in the 2.4 GHz (band designated for industrial, scientific and medical -
ISM-use) and 5 GHz bands and applications in the 800/900 MHz band, are the most significant example 
of unlicensed bands. Wireless microphones, radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems, medical 
equipment, or smart grid communications make use of license-exempt spectrum. The development and use 
of Wi-Fi is one of the most successful examples of the use of unlicensed and shared spectrum. Today, it is 
not only used by millions of users around the world it is playing an increasing role in areas such as NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 23 offloading mobile traffic on to fixed networks (Comscore, 2012). 7 In Australia, this type of regulation for 
spectrum is referred to as  " class licensed spectrum " . Many have wondered to what extent unlicensed bands suffer congestion or diminishing quality of 
service. A consultancy report undertaken for Ofcom in 2009 found that the majority of problems 
experienced by Wi-Fi users in the 2.4 GHz band were not spectrum-related, but mostly due to 
configuration issues or problems with the wired Internet (MASS Consultants Limited, 2009). The report 
said, however, that some inner city locations, such as in central London, exhibited signs of congestion and 
interference, which they said was expected to increase. Wi-Fi in the 5 GHz band is less condensed and has 
much more bandwidth, enabling non-overlapping channels and higher throughput. According to the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG),  " Collective Use of Spectrum (CUS) allows 
an unlimited number of independent users and devices to access spectrum in the same range of designated 
CUS frequencies at the same time and in a particular geographic area under a well-defined set of 
conditions. "  A well-known example of successful CUS implementation is the 863-870 MHz band in 
Europe, used by remote control devices, wireless microphones, hearing aids, RFID, audio transceivers, 
alarms, etc. As opposed to ASA/LSA, CUS does not grant exclusive access to spectrum nor provide 
interference protection from other users (RSPG, 2011). Authorised shared access/licensed shared access Even though a systematic approach towards maximising spectrum availability for wireless broadband 
would suggest targeting bands used for public purposes (defence, aeronautical, and so forth), clearing these 
may entail significant costs and long transitions. In 2010, for example, the President of the United States 
issued a Presidential Memorandum entitled  " Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution "  requiring 
that the Federal Government make available 500 MHz of federal or non-federal spectrum for both mobile 
and fixed wireless broadband use by commercial users within a decade (United States White House, 2010). 
In March 2012, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) concluded that 
clearing just one 95 MHz band by relocating existing Federal users to other parts of the spectrum would 
take 10 years, cost some USD 18 billion, and cause significant disruption to incumbent users (NTIA, 2012). In 2011, against this background, an industry consortium put forward a new framework to share 
spectrum based on the concept of licensed or authorised shared access. Qualcomm and Nokia Siemens 
Networks (NSN) propose a concept, Authorised Shared Access (ASA), a framework to share spectrum 
between a limited numbers of users. Under this concept, the existing spectrum user(s) ( " the incumbent(s) " ) 
would share spectrum with one or several licensed ASA users ( " ASA licensee(s) " ) in accordance with a set 
of pre-defined conditions. These conditions may be static (e.g. specific exclusion zone or time allowed for operation) or dynamic 
(e.g. geographic/time sharing, on-demand authorisation by ASA licensees or on-demand restrictions 
imposed by incumbents). Dynamic implementation of ASA takes advantage of the recent advances in 
geolocation and database technologies, allowing spectrum sharing on a frequency, location and time 
sharing basis. However, in the case of the incumbent(s) imposing restrictions, a system for updating, 
maintaining and providing the access conditions would first need to be established. The CEPT is 
contributing to the harmonisation of the 2.3, 3.4-3.6 and 3.6-3.8 GHz bands for IMT and IMT-Advanced 
systems, covering various scenarios. 8 According to the proposed ASA arrangement, band sharing would not be static and it would probably 
involve some compensation to the incumbent user in exchange for some quality of service (QoS). An ASA 
approach could benefit from dynamic assignment of channels, which could lead to a higher degree of 
spectrum utilisation. ASA also differs from the emerging  " white space "  model in that the channel NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 24 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS borrowers would be limited in number, licensed and subject to sharing rules included in their rights of use. 
Under white space devices (WSD) rules, there are no negotiations with incumbents and the number of 
opportunistic users is unlimited and their identities unknown, which for some increases concerns about 
possible interference and the practicality of tackling them. Another possible advantage of ASA is that it is 
implemented at the network level without any impact on devices, thus avoiding lengthy processes relating 
to device development. This facilitates a faster time to market and the achievement of economies of scale. In Europe, shared and collective use of spectrum is widespread, including shared use for civil and 
military applications. In 2012 the European Commission has issued a Communication on  " Promoting the 
shared use of radio spectrum resources in the internal market " . The CEPT and the RSPG, are considering 
the refined regulatory approach of ASA, the so-called  " Licensed Shared Access "  (LSA).  " Licensed shared 
access "  (LSA) aims to foster the potential to share spectrum, not only limited to the IMT bands, in a 
harmonised manner under a licensed regime. According to the RSPG definition, LSA is as  " a regulatory 
approach aiming to facilitate the introduction of radio communication systems operated by a limited 
number of licensees under an individual licensing regime in a frequency band already assigned or 
expected to be assigned to one or more incumbent users. Under the LSA approach, the additional users are 
authorised to use the spectrum (or part of the spectrum) in accordance with sharing rules included in their 
rights of use of spectrum, thereby allowing all the authorised users, including incumbents, to provide a 
certain Quality of Service (QoS) " , (RSPG, 2013). Hence, over the CUS, the LSA gives some rights to a 
new user. The concept still needs to be put into practice. The 2.3-2.4 GHz band is under consideration by 
the CEPT, which is currently developing regulatory provisions based on LSA. LSA aims to facilitate the 
introduction of new users requiring certain QoS in a frequency band, while ensuring the long-term 
incumbent use. In the United States, two reports from the President's Council of Economic Advisors in Science and 
Technology (PCAST) and from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) 
have been major drivers towards the increased shared use of spectrum. The PCAST report  " Realizing the 
full potential of government-held spectrum to spur economic growth "  found that clearing and reallocation 
of Federal spectrum is not sustainable due to high cost, lengthy implementation and possible disruption. It 
sets as a priority the recommendation that the United States Secretary of Commerce immediately identifies 
1 000 MHz of Federal spectrum in which to implement the new architecture and thereby create the first 
shared-use spectrum superhighways, thereby advancing the President's directive from 2010. The report 
strongly highlights that the norm for spectrum use should be sharing, not exclusivity. Moreover, spectrum 
management should focus on avoiding fragmentation, by specifying  " large frequency bands that can 
accommodate a wide variety of compatible uses and new technologies that are more efficient with larger 
blocks of spectrum. "  It draws attention to the fact that spectrum, in the United States, is largely fragmented 
which prevents the use of these larger bands in that country. The recommendations represent a change 
from previous approaches and are not supported by all players in the wireless industry. As mentioned in 
the section on spectrum harmonisation, this situation is rooted in historical reasons and in a higher degree 
of flexibility in spectrum allocations in that country. The PCAST report recommends that policies enabling commercial access to Federal spectrum be 
based primarily on their potential benefits for innovation and growth in wireless devices, services and 
associated markets, treating direct revenue considerations as secondary. More specifically, recom-
mendation 7.1 of the PCAST report recommends that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 
together with the NTIA, start the process to modify the rules to allow  " general authorised access "  devices 
to operate in two bands in the NTIA Fast Track list, specifically the 3 550-3 650 MHz (radar) band and 
another to be determined by the NTIA and FCC. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 25 In a similar framework to that of ASA, the FCC has put forward a Notice for Proposed Rulemaking 
(NRPM) to allow shared use of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band, in line with the PCAST recommendation. 
The NPRM proposes a scheme for shared use of spectrum and small cells, and seeks comment on the 
possible arrangements for implementation. The FCC proposes a multi-tiered shared access model, by 
means of a spectrum access system (SAS) with a dynamic database managing the new  " Citizens 
Broadband Service " . This service is aimed at tackling capacity shortages. The initial proposed model has 
three tiers of service: i) Incumbent Access, ii) Priority Access; and iii) General Authorised Access (GAA). 
It could be noted that the proposed three-tiered access model departs from ASA's two-tiered proposal and 
allows for a third type of user. The Incumbent Access tier would only consist of authorised federal users of the band, which would be 
protected from harmful interference. Other users would not be permitted to operate in areas designated for 
incumbent use. The Priority Access tier would include small cell use by certain users (priority users), 
which could deliver a certain quality of service to specific locations. As it stands now, the proposal only 
includes hospital, state and local government as explicit users of this access tier. Priority users would be 
obliged to register and would be entitled to protection for interference. Finally, the General Authorised 
Access tier would be assigned to the general public on a best-effort, non-interfering basis, without any 
entitlement to protection from interference, within designated geographic areas. Residential and business 
users, as well as service providers, would fall within this access tier. GAA users would also need to register. A further option proposed by the FCC is to extend the band use for GAA use to the 3 650-3 700 MHz 
band, currently used by wireless Internet service providers on a non-exclusive basis. If implemented, these 
users would switch from non-exclusive licenses to the license-by-the-rule framework proposed. This holds 
significant potential for small cell application, in particular regarding geographic sharing, especially in 
those cases where long distance reach is not critical. Figure 2. FCC's proposed sharing scheme for the 3.5 GHz band Source: FCC, NPRM, 12 December 2012. New spectrum technologies The development of new technologies, such as cognitive radio techniques – beacons, geolocation 
databases, sensing, and so forth – have allowed the establishment of communications when the channels 
are available. In 1999, Mitola and Maguire proposed the first software defined radio (SDR) architecture, 
which consisted of a pair of data converters, providing the maximum flexibility and programmability 
through the digital processing block (Mitola and Maguire, 1999). What they called  " radio etiquette "  is the NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 26 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS set of radiofrequency bands, protocols, and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate the use of the radio 
spectrum, thus becoming an excellent platform for providing cognitive radio. The International Telecommunications Union has provided definitions for these new technologies, in 
order to provide some clarity in the use of these terms (ITU, 2012): Software Defined radio (SDR):  " A radio transmitter and/or receiver employing a technology that 
allows the RF operating parameters including, but not limited to, frequency range, modulation 
type, or output power to be set or altered by software, excluding changes to operating 
parameters which occur during the normal pre-installed and predetermined operation of a radio 
according to a system specification or standard. "  Cognitive Radio System (CR):  " A radio system employing technology that allows the system: to 
obtain knowledge of its operational and geographical environment, established policies and its 
internal state; to dynamically and autonomously adjust its operational parameters and protocols 
according to its obtained knowledge in order to achieve predefined objectives; and to learn from 
the results obtained. "  There are various techniques possible to get information about the radio environment, for example 
sensing, cognitive pilot channel (CPC), or databases. There are also the so-called pre-cognitive 
technologies, such as Ultra-wide band Dynamic Frequency Selection (UWB DFS), Detect-and-Avoid 
(DAA) or RLAN DFS (used for radio local area networks). By using DFS, the equipment will search for a 
different free channel as soon as it detects that the requested channel is occupied. 9 These techniques are 
used, for example, in the 5 GHz operation of Wi-Fi, as there is some interference from radar systems in 
that band. The CEPT's Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) has been studying ASA/LSA since 2011. 
In October 2012, the CEPT Working Group on Frequency management (CEPT WGFM) decided to further 
develop the necessary regulatory framework to enable ASA/LSA. It established two project teams (FM52 
and FM53) to study, respectively: i) the 2.3-2.4 GHz band toward a draft ECC Decision and 
Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RRS); and ii) Licensed Shared Access (LSA) toward an ECC Report on 
general conditions and band-specific conditions for the implementation of the LSA, establishing the 
relevant interaction with ETSI. The ECC Report 205 on LSA is now published and under public 
consultation and the ECC decision on the 2.3-2.4 GHz bank in its final stage (ECC, 2013). Finally the 
ETSI RRS Technical Body has developed a System Reference Document for mobile broadband in the 2.3-
2.4 GHz band under the LSA regime with the objective of developing expected usage scenarios, technical 
characteristics/frequency arrangements and regulatory provisions related to compliance.  " Spectrum holes " , also known as  " white spaces " , are sub-bands of the radio spectrum that are 
underutilised at a particular instant of time and specific geographic location. A wireless device may 
identify spectrum holes in three ways: i) by consulting databases which contain information on the 
availability of spectrum holes in its local neighbourhood; or ii) by sensing the radio spectrum in its local 
neighbourhood in an unsupervised manner; or iii) by using beacons. The beacon approach requires the 
transmission from some appropriate infrastructure of a signal providing information on the availability of 
spectrum holes at the location of the device. In 2009, Ofcom concluded, based on responses received from 
a consultation, that the beacon approach was the least appropriate and did not merit further investigation 
for taking advantage of unused interleaved spectrum (white spaces). Ofcom also concluded that the use of 
databases was the most promising approach, possibly to be complemented in the future with sensing by the 
wireless device. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 27 Cognitive radio systems are being standardised at all levels, including at the ITU's Working Party 1B, 
various IEEE's 802 working groups (definitions at 802.11 and 802.22 and components at 802.19, 802.21 
and 802.22). Moreover, the IEEE's DySPAN standards committee, whose predecessor is the IEEE P1900 
is developing standards for radio spectrum management with a focus on improved use of spectrum. The 
ETSI's Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RSS) Technical Committee (TC) is also active in the field. The 
CEPT's Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) is actively working in cognitive radio issues, by 
means of the SE43 group, devoted to the discussion of white spaces devices, the Project Team FM, which 
discusses white spaces and licensed shared access issues, as well as a correspondence group on cognitive 
radio. In addition, many of the projects of the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission 
(FP7) address the research topic  " cognitive radio " . At present, equipment enabled to select the most interference-free operating frequency is widely 
available. The trend towards dynamic spectrum use means that spectrum allocation policies may need a 
major overhaul to take into account the implications of these technologies and to increase spectrum 
efficiency. In the midst of rapid technological evolution, spectrum management could also facilitate the transition 
of the use of spectrum from less to more valuable applications. In this regard,  " light licensing "  schemes or 
the proposed ASA/LSA approaches may contribute to this goal, in a context where spectrum trading may 
be too costly, uncertain to implement or not accepted by the market. On the other hand, when spectrum is 
available or can be cleared in a reasonable timeframe, many mobile network operators clearly prefer 
individual licensing schemes, which would make it easier to guarantee certain quality of service. For 
example, ASA proponents argue that this model involves a full set of rights and obligations for the licensee, 
guaranteeing legal certainty and quality of service while ensuring protection against interference for the 
incumbent. MNOs have, however, strongly relied on unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum to undertake Wi-Fi off-
loading, which shows the benefits of unlicensed spectrum as a complement to individual licensing and a 
potential driver for innovation. What spectrum managers are now considering is whether ASA/LSA schemes could add a 
supplementary licensing scheme, which would complement the existing two, i.e. exclusive licensed and 
licensed-exempt. On the one hand, it would facilitate monitoring and congestion management, as it would 
require licensing and the number of licenses would be limited. On the other hand, it would allow for 
sufficient flexibility in using vacant spectrum resources in the time or space domains. Some mobile network operators have argued that LSA could be applied to frequency bands that could 
not otherwise be exploited for commercial purposes in the short term (e.g. band clearing/refarming is not 
possible in the short term). The definition of  " incumbent users "  Spectrum is, of course, allocated to many public users. This includes areas such as emergency 
services, aeronautical use, the military and so forth, which essentially provide public goods that are 
challenging to value in financial terms. Nascent schemes to value spectrum used by the public sector are 
positive steps towards achieving a more efficient use of spectrum. In particular, administrative incentive 
pricing (AIP), implemented in Canada and in the United Kingdom, provides an effective tool for public 
users to value their spectrum holdings and an incentive for them to improve efficiency. A recurrent concept used by the proponents of ASA/LSA approaches is that of  " incumbent " . Under 
the LSA framework,  " an incumbent is a current holder of spectrum rights of use " . Some industry 
stakeholders, e.g. Qualcomm/Nokia, GSMA, argue for a definition of an  " incumbent "  spectrum holder or 
users as an entity that has been awarded spectrum resources as a result of a non-competitive tendering NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 28 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS process (i.e. government users). A mobile network operator proposed the definition of  " a current holder of 
spectrum rights for non-commercial purposes or governmental use " . According to the former views, 
mobile network operators would be excluded as they have been authorised to use spectrum based on an 
open auction, beauty contest or first come first served procedure. In the view of these proponents, the use 
of bands under ASA could be binary by nature, thus only allowing use by the incumbent or, should the 
band remain unused at a particular point in time or at a geographical location, only be used by MNOs. This departs from some of the proposed approaches such as the FCC's NPRM for the 3.5 GHz band, 
the Communication of the European Commission on  " Promoting the shared use of radio spectrum 
resources in the internal market " , and the recent regulation for the 1 900 MHz band enforced in the 
Netherlands in 2013, where 5 MHz of spectrum in the 1800 MHz (GSM) band were opened for license-
exempt, low power use by femtocell base stations (private GSM networks to achieve indoor and outdoor 
coverage). The Netherlands had tested the regulation on a trial-basis for three years with a smaller 
spectrum band (part of the DECT-guard band) and organisations had to register their use. After three years, 3 000 organisations had deployed their own base stations, which was seen as a 
success and a sign of strong market demand. To stimulate this use, the government opened up extra 
spectrum and removed the registration requirement. Using this solution, companies can save money on 
their calling costs, by handling in-company calls and external calls and routing it via the fixed network. 
Hospitals use this solution, because it offers better indoor coverage than DECT cordless phones. Event 
locations, like stadiums and exposition centres, use it to separate the mobile telephony of their personnel 
from that of the visitors, so that the personnel are not affected by an overloaded network during an event. 
Other uses of the spectrum might be for mobile networks to deploy their femtocells as well as for users on 
the edge of network coverage (e.g. rural areas) to provide indoor coverage using self-provisioned 
equipment. Using the approach adopted by The Netherlands, a country with among the highest population density 
in the OECD area, may be beneficial for other countries including those with sparsely populated areas on 
the edge of network coverage. Users at a location, such as on a farm, but with rooftop coverage through an 
external antenna might be able to use less expensive femtocells to provide service inside a residence or in a 
surrounding building or location. While such solutions are sometimes made available by MNOs the 
equipment is sometimes sold at significantly higher prices than likely to be the case if this market was open 
to competitive supply as in the case in some countries. The femtocell approach has also been used in Japan (see Box 3), with varying requirements in relation 
to the freedom of consumers to install devices of their choice. Overall, it seems that relaxing the 
requirements for customers to install small cells or femtocells may promote a wider adoption. These two 
examples from heavily populated countries are telling in that no apparent disruption of services has 
happened resulting from these light-licensing approaches, showing that these devices could be used more 
widely. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 29 Box 3. Femtocells and spectrum policy in Japan In Japan, in April 2008, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided on a policy aimed at 
flexible and simple installation and operation of femtocells, by reviewing and clarifying relevant rules including the 
radio law. The new approach recognised that femtocells could be used to improve coverage in small areas that receive 
weak or non-existent signals, such as inside a building. Femtocells were considered to be able to contribute to expansion of coverage inside buildings and underground areas, 
such as in tunnels, where mobile operators had faced challenges to install radio base stations by themselves, through 
their dedicated lines. However, the law and rules were out of date, in this regard, because they only allowed licensees 
of spectrum (i.e. mobile operators) to operate base stations including femtocells, thus hindering deployment of new 
equipment that could be easily controlled by users without any expertise. Amendment to the law was enacted in May 2008 and came into force in October 2008. Relevant administrative rules 
were also reviewed and modified accordingly. The main points of these modifications are as follows: @BULLET Small base stations, such as femtocells installed inside buildings, were allowed to be licensed collectively for 
each region, instead of individual licenses required for each such station before the amendment. @BULLET Femtocells and repeaters (amplifiers) were allowed to be operated by non-qualified users who are not licensees of 
spectrum, without surveillance of qualified technicians. @BULLET Technological conditions such as power limitations that femtocells should meet were established. @BULLET Application formats for collective licenses of femtocells and repeaters were simplified. As a result, the three major mobile operators, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI au and Softbank mobile, began to provide their 
users with femtocells from 2009 or 2010. These femtocells are connected to fixed broadband access lines to provide 
additional coverage in the immediate area. KDDI also started to install repeaters that expanded coverage, by 
amplifying radio waves inside buildings identified as repeaters, when more appropriate by follow-up examination. 
When these services were taken up, only NTT DoCoMo required users to pay additional cost although it was a small 
amount (JPY 315 = USD 3.20) although the service was suspended in September 2012. Instead, NTT currently 
commits to installing a femtocell as a method to improve public coverage wherever found to be necessary, as a result 
of a visit and examination to a user's premises following notification of a weak indoor signal. For the other two mobile operators, femtocell installation and operation has been free of charge from the outset except 
for electricity cost and the fixed broadband charge. It is also provided in response to user's notification of a weak 
signal and a follow-up examination. NTT DoCoMo has recently developed  " Xi femtocell "  that supports LTE in 
addition to 3G and started to deploy it in December 2012. Source: http://warp.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/3196220/www.soumu.go.jp/menu_news/s-news/2008/080417_2.html

Global identification for 3GPP E-UTRA An issue that can arise in debates surrounding policies promoting the sharing of spectrum is the final 
definition of incumbent users. To date, this has been clearly targeted at government spectrum holders or, as 
ASA proponents favour, to spectrum holdings that were not granted through open, competitive tendering 
processes. Nonetheless, some may want to further increase the scope for sharing, by including spectrum 
holdings of mobile operators that may be underutilised. There are two major considerations in that respect. 
First, operators may already do so if they so wish by reaching agreements on infrastructure sharing with 
other mobile operators, which include spectrum. In principle there may not, therefore, be any need for 
additional action. Second, spectrum trading has been made possible in an increasing number of markets, 
although it does not seem to be playing a significant role in most of them. According to a recent survey 
from the ECC/CEPT (ECC, 2011), some ten CEPT countries still maintain restrictions on spectrum trading, 
for example on trade in frequency, time or geography, even though the European Union regulatory 
framework allows these arrangements. Moreover, in CEPT countries where spectrum trading is possible, it 
has not developed, which may indicate a lack of interest on the part of market players or, more generally, a 
general need for more spectrum resources. Nonetheless, in a significant number of recent financial 
transactions between operators such as take-overs or merger bids, access to spectrum is increasingly cited 
as a major consideration. While noting the existing constraints in some countries, if spectrum sharing gains momentum in other 
OECD countries, private spectrum licensees – as opposed to government holders -may become more 
interested in this type of transaction. There will, of course, have to be a win-win arrangement, in terms of a 
fair remuneration for the party accepting to share its licensed spectrum resources or a clear case for 
spectrum underutilisation, backed by an independent assessment, or both. Nonetheless, governments may 
be more and more inclined to move towards these approaches if other initiatives, such as clearing and 
allocating new bands on an exclusive basis, do not bear fruit or present long-standing and costly barriers 
for clearance and allocation to new services. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 31 In light of the existing constraints for spectrum trading, another possibility may be that mobile 
operators are subject to some degree of obligation to share their underutilised spectrum resources, under 
certain conditions, which would increase spectrum efficiency. Such conditions would need to be developed 
in those countries that decide to pursue this approach, but they could rely on existing requirements for 
operators to achieve an acceptable efficiency in the use of spectrum resources, in order to avoid litigation. 
Spectrum inventories could be used to identify underutilisation of spectrum resources and, therefore, 
greater opportunities for sharing, bearing in mind the inventories' practical implementation issues and 
associated costs. An earlier version of shared access – TV White Spaces Box 4 shows some of the current examples of trials of television white space devices: Box 4. Current situation of Television White Spaces in selected OECD countries United States: The Federal Communication Commission's rules permit unlicensed radio devices to transmit on white 
space spectrum bands used by the broadcast television service (i.e. 54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-
698 MHz). In order to protect television broadcast and other licensed services operating in these bands, the rules 
require the TV white space devices to obtain a list of channels available for their operation. On 1 March 2013, the 
Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) authorised approved television white space database 
systems to provide service to unlicensed radio devices that operate in these spectrum bands. United Kingdom: Ofcom has been investigating possible use of white space spectrum since 2007. It preliminarily 
proposed license-exempt access, taking into account geolocation information provided by databases to location-aware 
white space wireless devices. As a result, Ofcom believes that license exempt devices could be authorised to use 
television white spaces, provided they operated in specific frequencies and at specific powers communicated to them 
by a TV white space data base (see Figure), in order to avoid harmful interference with television services operating 
in these bands. On 26 April 2013 Ofcom announced plans for a pilot of innovative 'white space' technology in the 
United Kingdom and invited industry to take part in the pilot, which is intended to take place in the autumn. The 
locations for the trial will be chosen once trial participants have been identified. Following a successful completion of 
the pilot, Ofcom anticipates that the technology could be fully rolled out during 2014, enabling the use of white space 
devices across the country. The Cambridge White Space Consortium: This Consortium designed a trial to assist Ofcom in its proposals for a 
license-exempt access to white space spectrum and to provide information on potential application in this band. Some 
of the experiments focus on the protection requirements for existing devices, the elements needed in the geo-location 
database, including reference geometries, coupling factors and protection ratios. They also address the presence of 
PMSE (Programme Making and Special Events) devices in white space spectrum. The Consortium brings together 
over 300 companies. In April 2013, Ofcom announced plans for another pilot, with a view to rolling out white space 
devices technology across the United Kingdom during 2014. 
…/… NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 32 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS Other pilot projects have been launched in some countries (e.g. Germany, Slovak Republic). White spaces could help 
alleviate the lack of license-exempt spectrum in some regions or bands (e.g. small unlicensed 868 MHz bands in 
Europe) and help release spectrum resources for a variety of uses, such as rural broadband, Wi-Fi networks with 
extended reach or M2M communications. Sources: Ofcom (2012), TVWS Consultation; Cambridge TV White Spaces Trial,  " A Summary of the Technical Findings " , 
www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/docs/Cambridge%20White%20Spaces%20Trial%20-%20technical%20findings-
with%20higher%20res%20pics.pdf Policy makers have been examining the possibility of using spectrum segments between active 
television broadcasting stations in a given area and time ( " interleaved spectrum " ) for wireless data 
applications. As discussed, in this report, this is not the only approach that is being sought to increase the 
efficiency of spectrum use, as initiatives such as administrative incentive pricing, incentive auctions and 
other ways for sharing spectrum are also attracting considerable attention. Nonetheless, the televisions 
white spaces discussion has been going on for some time, although the availability of devices and actual 
uptake are still extremely limited. Current provisions on Television White Spaces in the United Kingdom and the United States enable a 
more flexible use of spectrum, under some conditions, although the approach departs from the proposed 
ASA/LSA model in that it does not always oblige users of white spaces to register while operating in the 
band, however the devices have to provide their technical details and their location to the databases. In 
addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, some other countries have already engaged in 
consultations regarding white space devices. In 2011, Canada consulted on white spaces and in New 
Zealand the Radio Spectrum Policy and Planning group is planning to carry out a white space spectrum 
feasibility to investigate the amount of spectrum available for white space use. In some European countries, 
such as Denmark, France and Germany, white space spectrum in the UHF band is used for Programme 
Making and Special Event (PMSE) applications. A practical implementation of the use of white space is yet to be introduced on a widespread basis. 
The first white space device approval took place in December 2011 in the United States (Agility Data 
Radio – KTS Wireless), and the first commercial white space broadband network was launched in 
Wilmington, North Carolina in January 2012. For the time being, however, these deployments remain 
anecdotal and limited to single communities and take up of the service is very limited. 10 Moreover, it 
should be noted that in the European Union the regulatory framework for radio equipment largely differs 
from the rest of the world and involves ad-hoc measures. Despite the necessary precaution for ensuring 
smooth functioning of existing services, white space spectrum initiatives provide for a flexible license-
exempt framework to increase spectrum efficiency, in contrast with license-based schemes suggested under 
LSA/ASA. Two-or three-tiered access In the United States, the PCAST report recommended, when referring to shared use of Federal 
spectrum, that a three-tier approach be chosen, as opposed to the two-tiered alternative put forward by the 
proponents of ASA. Its reasoning stems from the principle that all non-interfering uses should be permitted 
in order to maximise utilisation of spectrum bands where the Federal government is the primary user. Ideally, the newly proposed framework for shared use of spectrum should try to accommodate a 
variety of approaches, possible applications and business models. While mobile carriers have expressed 
their preference for a licensed framework based on exclusivity, which enables them to provide quality of 
service and certainty for their investment, these desirable characteristics could eventually be made 
compatible with a wider variety of approaches. For example, spectrum resources (at a specific location, at a NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 33 particular time) that remain underutilised could be authorised for general authorised access, taking into 
account the clearing costs should that band be licensed for exclusive use at a later stage. In that respect, many note the overwhelming success of unlicensed spectrum applications. By way of 
example, it is often argued that the inferior characteristics of the unlicensed 900 MHz spectrum band in 
Europe in relation to the United States have imposed a severe burden on the European smart-grid industry. 
Only 15% of European smart-grid transmitters are wireless (87% in the United States), and those that are 
wireless use mobile communications, which may entail a higher cost. Some of the proposals for spectrum sharing, such as the FCC's 3.5 GHz NPRM, suggest that 
databases already developed for white spaces could provide a functional basis and evolve to accommodate 
a two-or three-tiered spectrum sharing scheme, subject to the inclusion of a set of new parameters. 
Whether these databases should be administered by a regulator/authority or by an authorised third-party 
administration is a different discussion, but any foreseen implementation of spectrum sharing could 
consider and test these implementation issues before they become operational. Any proposed framework for spectrum sharing could be subject to extensive public consultation, 
which identifies potential, interested parties. Mobile operators seem to have a strong preference for 
exclusive licensing or priority access to government spectrum where no or little sharing with third-party 
players takes place. Even though this approach has proven successful in recent years, approaches 
encouraging the inclusion of third parties may be accommodated in current spectrum holdings. Harmful interference and receiver regulation One of the technical challenges arising from a new environment where sharing is the rule and not the 
exception, is the issue of interference, in particular harmful interference. The complexity in a shared 
environment is that harmful interference may need to be defined on an ad-hoc basis, namely for each band 
and service provided over this band, being potentially complemented by some degree of receiver 
regulation/specification in terms of interference. It can be noted that increased needs for sharing and low interference levels may in themselves be 
contradictory. In other words, interference levels could potentially increase if more sharing occurs. The 
issue to discern in this environment is whether, and to what extent, increased levels of interference may not 
disrupt operations of existing users, while potentially accommodating new ones. The ITU-R's radio regulations have established three different types of interference, when referring to 
international frequency co-ordination between administrations: i)  " permissible " : which complies with 
quantitative and sharing criteria established by the regulation, ii)  " accepted " : interference at a higher level 
than  " permissible " , but which has been agreed upon between two or more administrations, and 
iii)  " harmful " : which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation services or of other safety services or 
seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radiocommunication service. 11 According to the PCAST report, much could be done to adapt the current regulatory approach to 
increase the attention paid to the ability of receivers to operate under a certain degree of interference. The 
argument made is that poor receivers or, more widely, lack of awareness of the conditions in which 
receivers can operate, adds considerable uncertainty to potential shared use of spectrum. It is, therefore, 
necessary to complement existing transmitter regulation with some degree of receiver regulation, which 
would clearly state the technical parameters for receivers necessary to qualify/certify their operation within 
an accepted interference environment. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 34 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS In the transition towards a spectrum management framework where significantly more sharing occurs, 
it may no longer make sense for regulation to solely focus on transmission. It is becoming increasingly 
important to consider receiver performance in addition to radio transmitters and may also be necessary to 
consider incentives to promote more resilient and efficient radio devices. It would avoid the need to 
mandate that receivers be built, sold, or operated with specific performance characteristics; and it could 
incentivise incumbent spectrum users to improve receivers to more efficiently use spectrum. As more 
spectrum is made available for mobile broadband services, it is becoming more important that all wireless 
licensees and users understand the radio frequency environment and that entrants understand interference 
rights and responsibilities before engaging in significant investments. Management opportunities and choices Spectrum sharing, under unlicensed or light-license schemes, is a clear opportunity to increase the 
efficiency in its use, by making underutilised spectrum resources available to other uses. This new 
approach, however, has to be backed by sound technical examination in areas such as interference 
mitigation assessments and through feasibility studies. Given the relatively limited experience in spectrum sharing arrangements, broad consultation is 
needed to identify potentially interested stakeholders and general awareness of the possibilities spectrum 
sharing enables. In particular, spectrum inventories and databases could help identify sharing opportunities, 
by providing information about spectrum utilisation. Given the potential for harmful interference and the 
impact of possible disruption of current systems, in-depth studies for certain bands remain indispensable, 
for a clear light-licensing/authorisation framework to be established. In particular, the maintenance and 
operations of spectrum sharing databases appear to be crucial for these beneficial sharing opportunities to 
be taken to fruition. Policy makers need to address a number of areas, and reassess them in view of the new situation and 
the general trend towards increased sharing. A clear candidate for this reassessment is receiver regulation, 
whereby governments may need to establish requirements for certain bands to increase legal certainty for 
potential spectrum sharing schemes. INCENTIVE AUCTIONS This report examines a number of approaches to increase the availability and use of spectrum in more 
efficient ways. This is critical if greater use is to be made of wireless broadband services and the benefits 
that they can bring for economic and social development. Over the past two decades, policy makers have 
made greater use of the market for spectrum allocation through tools such as auctions. Further market-
based mechanisms, such as spectrum trading, have also played an important role in some countries. Given 
the growing demand for spectrum and its finite nature the greater use of tools such as trading may help 
better align supply and demand. The best-known example of increasing the availability of spectrum is the 
possibility to transition some spectrum allocated to broadcasting to alternative uses that are more valued by 
the market, notably wireless broadband services. Voluntary market-based tools have a number of 
significant advantages as they can avoid some of the major challenges related to changing spectrum use: 
the issue of migrating existing users, legal certainty for incumbent spectrum holders and the legal 
instrument used to encourage or mandate that spectrum holders relinquish such resources. In 2010, the United States National Broadband Plan introduced the idea of conducting incentive 
auctions, as a tool to help meet that country's spectrum requirements. The FCC, acting on this plan, has 
proposed to conduct such auctions. The underlying mechanism is that spectrum holders (typically 
broadcasters) voluntarily agree to relinquish spectrum resources at a given price. Simultaneously, potential 
bidders, e.g. communication operators, propose a certain price for these resources. The process of running NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 35 any auction for spectrum can be relatively complex and an incentive auction is no exception. The process 
observes a two-sided nature of buyer and seller but is perhaps most distinguishable, from a traditional 
auction of spectrum, in that the FCC is not the  " seller "  but rather acts to facilitate the process as might an 
auctioneer and perform related notary tasks. The related tasks include reallocating the licenses of 
broadcasters that have relinquished bands or repacking spectrum resources to build lots that make 
economic sense. Incentive auctions of spectrum constitute a relatively novel approach in the global arena 
and still need to be tested and undertaken but, if successfully implemented, could certainly provide a useful 
new tool for reallocating spectrum for mobile communication services. Spectrum auction theory and incentive auctions Nowadays, auctioning spectrum is a common practice in OECD countries. Commencing in the early 
1990s, in New Zealand and the United States, more and more countries have chosen auctions to assign 
spectrum for communication services. Over time the design of auctions has been improved and sometimes 
made more complex in relation to meeting perceived challenges (e.g. potential collusion) or obtaining 
desired outcomes, e.g. increased competition (Porter and Smith, 2006). One such innovation has been, for 
example, the transition from auctioning single or small groups of licenses to grouping them in order to 
maximise the visibility for participants, so that they could adjust their bids accordingly. Nonetheless, the 
most beneficial advantages of auctions have been their transparency, for all stakeholders, in arriving at 
explainable outcomes and using the market's knowledge to arrive at a better appreciation of the value of 
spectrum. In recent years, some countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom have followed the combinatorial clock auction approach. The format 
allows bidders to express their willingness to pay across the range of packages of the lots that are of 
interest to them and it treats bids for packages of lots as inseparable (i.e. a bidder cannot win only a sub-
part of a package it bids on, it either wins a package in its entirety or not at all). This is a type of ascending 
auction and can include an open phase of bidding to help price and outcome discovery and a 
supplementary single round of bidding to complement the bids of the open phase, with specific rules that 
promote bidding in accordance with true preferences. Like all market mechanisms, it requires careful 
design, tailored to the circumstances, and it allows for the resolution of a range of issues in the auction. For 
example, a combinatorial clock auction does not require pre-defined licences with specified amounts of 
spectrum for each licence and one licence per winner. The format can also determine the band plan for the 
spectrum on offer, if there is uncertainty as to how much spectrum should go to two or more competing 
types of uses (e.g. terrestrial mobile vs. satellite use). The format also lends itself to using generic lots, 
i.e. lots that are in a category of similar blocks of spectrum, but not tied to specific frequencies. With 
generic lots, the auction first deals with the key question of who wins how much spectrum in the different 
category, and moves in a subsequent phase to the secondary question of what exact frequencies the winners 
will receive. As noted above, in the case of incentive auctions, combining the sale and purchase of spectrum in the 
same market process raises challenges of complexity for the auctioneer and participants. As a result, some 
have proposed that using generic lots for an incentive auction could help in managing complexity. For 
example, for its upcoming incentive auction of 600 MHz spectrum, the FCC has proposed auctioning 
generic blocks to avoid the complexity, delay, and computational burden that bidding on specific licenses 
would create. Ofcom, the regulator in the United Kingdom, in its call for inputs on future use of the 
700 MHz band has considered whether an incentive auction could allow market participants to determine 
whether release of a band may happen earlier than a backstop date, with sellers setting out minimum 
payments they would need to receive in order to vacate the band earlier while new users express their 
willingness to pay for earlier access. 12 This approach, while including a fixed deadline for the 
implementation of changes (and, in this case, also fixing the amount of spectrum to be released), offers NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 36 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS scope for market optimisation of the release date, although Ofcom recognises that there is a question as to 
whether an appropriate incentive auction can be designed in the context of future use of the 700 MHz band. There may be forms of incentive auctions which could avoid having to define a band plan prior to the 
auction itself (though incentive auctions do not rule out having pre-defined band plans). If so, this could 
allow regulators to avoid the complex process of defining a band plan, and allow more flexibility. However, 
in some cases there are benefits to an internationally-harmonised band plan, which would be foregone if 
band plans were dependent on the outcomes of national incentive auctions. Moreover, spectrum auctions play a key role in shaping wireless markets, and therefore deserve a 
careful examination from competition authorities. In fact, spectrum is a key asset for wireless competition. 
Today, it is common to see a fair amount of attention from regulators to spectrum holdings from operators 
that request to merge and to undertake spectrum transactions in secondary markets. This is the case even 
though secondary markets are generally not yet well developed in most OECD countries. A common 
measure in spectrum auctions is the imposition of spectrum caps, which limit the maximum amount of 
spectrum that the largest players may bid for (input restrictions). In its 4G auction of 2013, the United 
Kingdom also used outcome restrictions, or spectrum floors, to ensure that, subject to demand in the 
auction, its outcome would be consistent with competition policy objectives for the mobile sector. Another 
possibility is to impose a bidding cap for a specific auction, in that players are not allowed to bid for more 
than a given amount of spectrum in that auction, regardless of other criteria such as their size or their 
current spectrum holdings. Box 3. FCC's incentive auctions Background: In its 2010 National Broadband Plan, the Federal Communications Commission ( " FCC " ) proposed incentive 
auctions as one means to facilitate economically beneficial reallocation of spectrum. The plan describes an incentive 
auction as a voluntary, market-based means of repurposing spectrum by encouraging existing broadcast television 
licensees to voluntarily relinquish spectrum usage rights in exchange for a share of the proceeds from an auction of 
new licenses to use the repurposed spectrum. This process brings market forces to bear on many of the most 
important decisions about spectrum reallocation, e.g., how much spectrum and in what markets should spectrum be 
reallocated. In early 2012, the United States Congress authorised the FCC to conduct incentive auctions, with the first 
auction to be of broadcast television spectrum. Congress further directed that certain net proceeds from the broadcast 
incentive auction are to be deposited in a Public Safety Trust Fund to fund a national first responder network, state 
and local public safety grants, and public safety research, and the balance is to be used for deficit reduction. In 
October 2012, the FCC launched a rulemaking proceeding to hold the world's first incentive auction. The propagation characteristics of spectrum in the UHF bands (e.g., further reach and better penetration 
through buildings than higher frequencies and, therefore, the need for fewer transmitters to cover the same area), 
which are allocated to broadcast television, also make spectrum in these bands especially well-suited for mobile 
broadband uses. The particular suitability of UHF spectrum for mobile broadband is why the incentive auction 
process holds such promise. Through the incentive auction, a portion of the spectrum currently occupied by broadcast 
television licensees will be made available for mobile broadband. The FCC will use its unique authority to replace the 
broadcast licenses that it reclaims in the reverse auction with flexible use licenses for the cleared spectrum that may 
cover large geographic areas that were previously occupied by numerous individual stations (see figure below with 
broadcast television spectrum in the United States). Without the FCC's authority and co-ordination, the creation of 
such licenses suitable for deploying mobile broadband service nationwide would be impossible. …/… NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 37 Source: FCC. Auction Design: The incentive auction itself will actually be comprised of two separate but interdependent auctions: i) a 
reverse auction, which will determine the price at which broadcasters will voluntarily relinquish their spectrum usage 
rights; and ii) a forward auction, which will determine the price that companies are willing to pay for flexible use of 
wireless licenses. The lynchpin joining the reverse and the forward auctions is the  " repacking "  process. Repacking 
involves reorganising and assigning channels to the remaining broadcast television stations in order to create 
contiguous blocks of cleared spectrum suitable for flexible use. However, the FCC must take great care in the 
repacking process because the United States Congress requires the FCC to make all reasonable efforts to preserve the 
 " coverage area "  and  " population served "  of the television stations involved. In order to be successful, each of the components must work together. Ultimately, the reverse auction 
requires information about how much bidders are willing to pay for spectrum licenses in the forward auction; and the 
forward auction requires information regarding what spectrum rights were tendered in the reverse auction, and at 
what price; and each of these depend on efficiently repacking the remaining broadcasters. The actual implementation, 
while it will be thoroughly explained and illustrated in technical documents and rules, is designed to place the 
complex elements  " under the hood, "  with an aim to make participation as straight-forward and easy as possible from 
the bidder's perspective. In the reverse auction, broadcasters would have at least four options: i) do not participate in the auction and 
stay on the air on the same or another channel in the same band, as determined in the repacking process; ii) participate 
and bid to give up all rights to their channel and go off the air; iii) participate and bid to give up all rights to their 
channel but share a channel with another broadcaster after the auction; or iv) participate and bid to give up all rights 
to their channel but move from UHF to VHF and remain on the air. All options are designed to help make the 
auction accessible to the widest possible range of broadcaster participants. The forward auction piece of the incentive auction will differ from the typical spectrum auction because, 
unlike typical spectrum auctions, the number and locations of licenses available in the forward auction will depend 
upon the results of the reverse auction. The FCC is considering innovative new approaches to auction design to 
manage this interrelationship and integrate the different auction components. Furthermore, unlike other band plans, the final structure of the 600 MHz band plan will depend on the results 
of the reverse auction. Therefore, rather than a fixed, predetermined band plan, the FCC proposes to adopt a band 
plan that accommodates varying amounts of available wireless spectrum. The FCC is also considering using bidding 
for  " generic "  spectrum blocks, which can then be translated into specific licenses at the end of the auction. This 
practice, common in European spectrum auctions, would be expected to speed up the forward auction, reducing the 
cost of bidder participation. Conclusion: The incentive auction will present a significant financial opportunity for broadcasters who wish to relinquish 
spectrum rights, while also allowing other broadcasters to remain on the air and continue providing the public with 
local, free over-the-air television service. At the same time, the spectrum reclaimed through the auction will promote 
economic growth; increase the speed, capacity and ubiquity of mobile broadband service; and accelerate the 
smartphone and tablet-led mobile revolution, benefitting consumers and businesses throughout the country. The FCC 
intends to conduct the broadcast incentive auction in 2014. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 38 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS The repacking process The repacking process in an incentive auction, together with the rules for broadcasters to release 
spectrum, forms the basis for the future band segmentation plan and determines the amount of spectrum 
that will be freed in the process. The proposed auction design contains a number of features, such as 
generic bidding and simultaneous ascending bidding, which address some of the challenges identified by 
the FCC in previous auctions. At first glance however, it is the repacking process that seems, at the same 
time, more innovative and challenging. As the firms assisting with the incentive auction process have noted 
in their discussion documents filed to the FCC proceedings, the final amount of spectrum that will be freed 
depends not only on the willingness of broadcasters to relinquish their spectrum rights, but also on how the 
remaining channels will be rearranged. Repacking involves the complex engineering and auction design challenge of assigning channels to 
the broadcast television stations that remain on the air after the incentive auction in order to clear 
contiguous blocks of spectrum suitable for flexible use. How the FCC conducts the repacking will have a 
significant impact on its ability to repurpose spectrum in the incentive auction (Milgrom et al., 2012). In considering which channels can be assigned to which television stations, the FCC recognises that 
television stations can cause harmful interference to each other if they are assigned to the same or adjacent 
television channels. The legislation authorising the incentive auction requires that in repacking, the FCC 
 " make all reasonable efforts to preserve […] the coverage area and population served of each broadcast 
television licensee […] "  (FCC, 2012b). The FCC is developing methodologies and implementing software 
to integrate the repacking function into the auction design such that real-time evaluations of technical 
feasibility for assigning channels to broadcasters can be made in a manner that meets the statutory 
requirements. Alternative instruments to release broadcasting spectrum Undoubtedly, the main strengths of incentive auctions are that they are voluntary and market-based. 
Once policy makers agree that more spectrum resources need to be freed up and dedicated to mobile 
broadband use, they need to make a decision about the right procedure to fulfil this objective. At the same 
time they need to bear in mind the existing constraints, such as the impact on current services, the 
migration timeframe, expected costs and so forth. They can consider alternatives such as spectrum sharing, 
increasing incentives for secondary markets or mandating the release of broadcasting spectrum but 
recognise that they may involve a less consensual approach. Promoting spectrum trading in secondary markets may constitute a reasonable alternative to incentive 
auctions. Some have noted the existing barriers to spectrum trading, such as the conditions imposed on 
spectrum licensees, lengthy transaction delays or the lack of information about possible spectrum 
transaction (Mayo and Wallsten, 2011). Conducting auctions in a centralised manner is believed to have a 
number of advantages over secondary trading, as having an authority conducting auctions removes the 
challenge of multi-party co-ordination (Kwerel et al., 2012), especially with regard to the repacking 
process, as spectrum could be freed by forming a meaningful group that can be optimised for mobile 
broadband use. As noted above, a number of countries in the European Union still keep restrictions on 
spectrum trading and, where it is permitted, it has not yet been widely used. Another factor that may play a 
role is the overall shortage of spectrum resources for mobile operators, which may drive industry players to 
acquire spectrum through mergers, as opposed to secondary markets, being subject to scrutiny from 
competition authorities, under the assumption that most carriers would not be willing to sell their rights on 
secondary markets. NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS 39 In light of these concerns, measures favouring spectrum trading, such as establishing clear and 
detailed rules, with clearly defined rights and obligations, publishing available information about tradable 
spectrum or minimising administrative overheads, may certainly help develop more efficient secondary 
markets (OECD, 2005). Except for its potential effect on spectrum harmonisation, nothing prevents policy 
makers from further promoting spectrum trading, so these measures could be regarded as a complement 
rather than a substitute of other means of increasing spectrum efficiency. Regarding broadcasting spectrum, 
there are currently regulatory barriers that prevent spectrum transfers for uses other than those reflected in 
license conditions, as service neutrality is the exception rather than the rule. Another, more straightforward approach is simply mandating the migration from broadcasting to 
wireless communication uses, as has been done for the release of the digital dividend in many OECD 
countries. While  " mandating "  is a fairly general term, open to many variations, to some extent it carries the 
character of non-voluntariness, which would imply that broadcasters do not have the choice of staying in 
their current channels. This  " compulsory "  approach would not necessarily mean that broadcasters are forced 
to cease their activities as they are likely to have several alternatives to continue their business. Moving to 
lower bands (e.g. VHF), switching to wired distribution of channels where fixed broadband networks are 
available, accepting more interference or simply willing to share spectrum in a digital multiplex may be 
among the available options. Moreover, improved coding and transmission techniques allow for lower 
bandwidth and thus some channels would be freed only by technology upgrading. Of course, the pros and 
cons of each of these alternatives would depend on the amount of spectrum to be released. In many OECD countries, such as Spain, the clearance of the digital dividend band (the 800 MHz 
band in that country) was conducted on a  " compulsory "  basis, but it did not result in any broadcaster being 
unable to continue its service. Instead, new channels were introduced as a result of spectrum efficiency 
gains arising from the transition to digital technology. This may be harder to achieve for lower 
broadcasting bands, although the introduction of new technologies such as MPEG4, DVB-T2 or, in the 
near future, HEVC in broadcasting may offer an opportunity to achieve further spectrum efficiency. The pros and cons of a  " voluntary "  versus  " non-voluntary "  approach would need to be assessed for 
each OECD country. That would include the possibility of mandating migration in view of factors such as 
the duration of broadcasting licenses, the authority of spectrum regulators to relinquish these rights or the 
overall spectrum band allocation in that country, especially with regard to the possibility of migrating 
broadcasters to other spectrum bands. The availability of high-speed fixed lines alternatives will, of course, 
be an important consideration when assessing the different possibilities. Implementing incentive auctions raises a number of legal and practical issues, in particular whether 
regulators have the necessary legal powers to undertake incentive auctions or whether pre-existing 
conditions (e.g. existing rights to use spectrum) lend themselves to this sort of market mechanism. There 
may also be issues resulting from the time elapsed between any incentive auction and the starting of new 
licences. In short, the issue is whether countries other than the United States could undertake an incentive 
auction and to what extent it would deliver satisfactory results. Several factors may play a role in that 
respect, such as the spectrum harmonisation issues and the powers of regulators to undertake incentive 
auctions. An intermediate approach is to let the market participants decide on the timing of the release of 
the band, for which they would express their preferences. This approach, while keeping its  " compulsory 
character "  would allow for a higher degree of flexibility (Ofcom, 2013). A potential problem of using incentive auctions in the European Union as an authorisation and re-
allocation mechanism is that it may deliver different results in different countries (member states). 
Incentive auctions in the European Union area could therefore, some suggest, lead to spectrum fragmenta-
tion and the subsequent loss of economies of scale for network deployment and device manufacturing, 
compared to the current situation (i.e. national awards of internationally-harmonised bands). In practice, NEW APPROACHES TO SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT 40 OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPERS the scope for incentive auctions to lead to fragmentation will depend on what is to be determined in the 
auction. For example, there is greater risk of fragmentation if the band plan is dependent on the auction 
outcome. Another option would be to have incentive auctions which awarded spectrum across the 
European Union. However, some countries of the European Union argue that harmonised rules at the 
European level would have the risk of being too inflexible and that countries which wished to release 
spectrum ahead of the international timetable would be held back from doing so, leading to a delay in 
delivering benefits to manufacturers, operators and consumers in those countries. Late adopters, they argue, 
would not be able to benefit from the lessons learned from the initial auctions. These challenges are, of 
course, not exclusive to incentive auctions and are frequently raised as arguments against certain aspects of 
spectrum harmonisation. Having said that, one of the goals of the European Union's Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) 
is the harmonisation of technical conditions for spectrum use at the regional (European) level. An 
intermediate approach would be setting minimum thresholds for relinquishing spectrum rights or by 
adopting additional measures in those countries where spectrum use by broadcasters is more intense, such 
as subsidies for migrating broadcasters, which could facilitate European-wide harmonisation. Finally, the FCC's incentive auction proceedings incorporate some provisions related to unlicensed 
use of spectrum, such as keeping the possibility of using unlicensed devices in guard bands or allowing the 
use of white space devices, even though the available spectrum for these applications may be reduced as a 
result of higher concentration of broadcasters in the lower UHF bands after the auction.
