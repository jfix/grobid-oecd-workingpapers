The Japanese case study examines the goals, measurements, achievements<lb/> and future challenges of the country&apos;s food loss and waste policies. The Japanese government<lb/> has implemented policies to suppress and recycle food loss and waste since 2000 under its<lb/> Food Recycling Law. The control of food waste generation is based on a specific target for<lb/> each industry group, in order to address differences in the scope for loss and waste reduction<lb/> across sectors. While food waste in the food industry has been reduced, the waste at consumer<lb/> stage has shown no change in recent years, highlighting outstanding challenges at the<lb/> consumer stage.<lb/> Preventing food waste has been a priority for Governments in the United Kingdom for<lb/> over a decade, and a range of mechanisms have been put in place to deliver this within<lb/> households, hospitality and food service, food manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors. The<lb/> UK case study outlines the policy context within which food waste prevention sits, explains<lb/> how food waste is defined in the United Kingdom, provides detail on the level and types of<lb/> food waste across different sectors, and describes the interventions adopted and their impacts.<lb/> Between 2007 and 2012 household food waste reduced by 15%, despite a 4% increase in<lb/> household numbers, and food waste at manufacture and retail fell by 10% between 2009 and<lb/> 2012. There is significant potential to reduce food waste further, however it is likely that this<lb/> will become increasingly challenging<lb/></p>
