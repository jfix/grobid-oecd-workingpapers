			<p>The contagion of the global credit crisis from the<lb/> industrialised countries to the emerging markets has<lb/> taken some time to develop. Then, in October 2008, it<lb/> spread rapidly, afflicting all emerging markets, without any<lb/> distinction or regard to their so-called &quot; fundamentals &quot; . For<lb/> believers in &quot; decoupling &quot; , the high growth rates, massive<lb/> foreign exchange (FX) reserves, balanced budgets and<lb/> rising consumerism in the emerging markets at first<lb/> reassured investors. It is now clear that the diagnosis<lb/> of emerging-market policy performance suffered from<lb/> hyperbole. In the end, all emerging market asset classes<lb/> were hit: stocks, bonds and currencies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The current financial crisis has lessons for<lb/> the diagnosis of emerging-market policy<lb/> performance,<lb/> the channels of crisis contagion, and<lb/> the future of private and official development<lb/> finance.<lb/> Optimists about decoupling underplayed the cyclicality and<lb/> endogeneity of important policy performance indicators:<lb/> Emerging-market growth rates: Much of the recent<lb/> growth has been driven by an extraordinary bonanza<lb/> in raw-materials prices and low financing costs.<lb/> Many analysts forgot the basic principle that growth<lb/> rates can only be sustained over the long run when<lb/> underpinned by productivity growth. Arguably, from<lb/> this perspective, many Asian countries have more<lb/> sustainable growth rates than emerging markets in<lb/> other regions.<lb/></p>

			<p>FX reserve levels: Their durability depends very much<lb/> on the exchange rate regime. Authorities may wish to<lb/> avoid a currency slump, and may need to recapitalise<lb/> their banking systems; but if both foreign and domestic<lb/> investors lose confidence, even very impressive levels<lb/> of FX reserves can melt quickly away (as witnessed<lb/> in Russia recently). As long as reserves are below the<lb/> liabilities of the banking system (M2), individuals may<lb/> rush to convert their domestic currency deposits into<lb/> foreign currency and put pressure on the currency as<lb/> reserves dwindle...<lb/></p>

			<p>What about the future? It is possible to distil important<lb/> policy lessons about preventing, managing and resolving<lb/> financial crises from recent emerging-market crises. One<lb/> thing in common with these crises is that they were less<lb/> caused by domestic factors and more related to crisis<lb/> contagion from elsewhere. Furthermore, such policy lessons<lb/> need to inform debates regarding the construction of a new<lb/> international (or regional) financial architecture 2 . Crisis<lb/> contagion in principle occurs through three channels:<lb/></p>

			<p>Through foreign trade (sometimes known as the<lb/> &quot; monsoon effect &quot; ): the monsoon effects hit small<lb/> open economies easily through merchandise trade<lb/> precisely because they are both small and open to<lb/> trade. Low-income countries will be mostly hit through<lb/> the monsoon channel as recession in OECD countries<lb/> deepens.<lb/> Through financial contagion, when money invested<lb/> is repatriated. Currency mismatches in corporate and<lb/> bank balance sheets can cause widespread company<lb/> and bank failures.<lb/> Through &quot; pure &quot; contagion, as happened in October<lb/> 2008, when a systemic and simultaneous breakdown<lb/> of money and banking markets leads to generalised<lb/> risk aversion and the shedding of all assets without<lb/> public guarantees.<lb/> Financial crises that are caused by the monsoon effect<lb/> or by financial contagion can in principle be predicted<lb/> through the monitoring of macroeconomic variables. Pure<lb/> contagion, by contrast, hits countries regardless of their<lb/> level of economic integration and is hard to predict or<lb/> to quantify. A wave of pure contagion, however, can be<lb/> stopped more easily by reversing expectations through<lb/> implementing decisive reflationary policies.<lb/> ________<lb/> <ref type="biblio">2.

			<p>As a mid-term consequence of the global credit crisis,<lb/> private debt will be financed only reluctantly, and capital<lb/> costs are bound to rise in the face of higher risk. Solvent<lb/> governments and public institutions will be forced to<lb/> become the lenders of last resort. The consequences for<lb/> development finance and the global financial architecture<lb/> will be important. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows clearly how development<lb/> loans by the World Bank, the IMF, and the regional<lb/> development banks had been crowded out by private-<lb/>sector lending throughout the boom decade. The supply<lb/> of public development finance will rise and regain some<lb/> of the attractiveness to poor countries that it lost during<lb/> the boom period.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using a small part of emerging countries&apos; high FX reserves<lb/> to leverage them through multilaterial development banks<lb/> is a feasible way to restore development finance. Likewise,<lb/> the role of public guarantees, in particular by AAA-rated<lb/> governments, will have to be enhanced.<lb/></p>
