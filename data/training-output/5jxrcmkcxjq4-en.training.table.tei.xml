            <head>: The European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry operates the European Enterprise Promotion Awards,<lb/> which </head>
 
            <figDesc>provide awards to entrepreneurs in six categories and a Jury&apos;s Grand Prize for the entry that is deemed to be the<lb/> most creative and inspiring entrepreneurship initiative in Europe. One of the six categories is for &apos;responsible and inclusive<lb/> entrepreneurship&apos;, which recognises regional or local actions promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainable<lb/> business practices. This includes support for people with disabilities and the 2012 winner of this category was a project<lb/> called &apos;Disabled at Work&apos; that was operated by a group of 16 organisations from Turkey and the Netherlands. It provides<lb/> training and mentoring for people with disabilities that seek to enter the workforce, either as an employee or through self-<lb/>employment. The 2013 winner in the inclusive entrepreneurship category was &apos;Integration of Disabled People&apos; in the Slovak<lb/> Republic, which provides driving training for people with disabilities.<lb/> Intervention type: Awards and recognition programme across the EU.<lb/> Objectives: The objectives of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards are to identify and recognise successful activities<lb/> and initiatives undertaken to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship; showcase and share examples of best entrepre-<lb/>neurship policies and practices; create a greater awareness of the role entrepreneurs play in society; and to encourage and<lb/> inspire potential entrepreneurs.<lb/> Entry requirements: Entries are made to national juries that each represent a Member State. Eligible entities can be national<lb/> organisations, towns, cities, regions and communities as well as public–private partnerships between public authorities and<lb/> entrepreneurs, educational programmes and business organisations. International initiatives are eligible as long as they are<lb/> nominated jointly by all countries involved.<lb/> Description: The competition has two stages. Applicants must first compete at the national level, where each country selects<lb/> two entries to be nominated for the EU competition. From these entries, a shortlist of nominees is chosen by the European jury.<lb/> Nominees for 2013 were selected based on the following criteria: (i) originality and feasibility; (ii) the impact that they have<lb/> on the local economy; (iii) the improvement of local stakeholder relations; and (iv) the transferability of the project to other<lb/> regions in Europe. All nominees from the national and European competitions were invited to attend an awards ceremony.<lb/> To raise awareness about the European Enterprise Awards, the European Commission works in partnership with several<lb/> European umbrella organisations, including the Assembly of European Regions, Committee of the Regions, Eurocities, European<lb/> Association of Economic Development Agencies, Eurochambres and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-<lb/>Sized Enterprises. Each organisation promotes the awards and nominees through their networks and communication channels.</figDesc>
