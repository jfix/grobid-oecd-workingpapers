			<body>ABSTRACT/RESUMÉ <lb/>Portugal: Solid foundations for a sustainable fiscal consolidation <lb/>Owing to slow growth and a relatively weak fiscal position, Portugal&apos;s public debt had been rising for almost a <lb/>decade when the global crisis struck, sharply increasing the deficit. The loss of confidence in Portuguese and other <lb/>euro area sovereign bonds required international financial support. Weak fiscal performance reflects a wide range of <lb/>fiscal structural problems resulting in poor control of expenditure. At both the central and local levels, this was <lb/>compounded by the non-transparent accumulation of payment arrears, future spending obligations via Public-Private <lb/>Partnerships (PPPs) and off-balance sheet debt in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In line with the EU-IMF <lb/>programme, the government is steadfastly implementing an ambitious front-loaded consolidation plan underpinned by <lb/>a wide range of structural reforms. In a context of weak private sector demand, the government&apos;s ability to regain <lb/>control over public debt dynamics depends crucially on avoiding spending overruns. This will require reinforcing the <lb/>fiscal framework to improve expenditure control, tackling payment arrears and avoiding further negative surprises <lb/>from loss-making SOEs, PPPs and local governments. The success of the programme will also require maintaining <lb/>social consensus around it, notably through continuous attention to its implications for the poorest. If growth is far <lb/>lower than projected in the programme, the automatic stabilisers could be allowed to operate at least partially to <lb/>reduce the risks of a deeper recession and higher unemployment. This Working Paper relates to the 2012 OECD <lb/>Economic Survey of Portugal (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/portugal). <lb/>JEL classification: E62, H54, H61, H63, H70 <lb/>Keywords: Portugal; public debt sustainability; automatic stabilisers; fiscal framework; fiscal rules; budgeting; fiscal <lb/>council; state-owned enterprises; public-private partnerships; local government; EU funds; Madeira <lb/>************ <lb/>Portugal: Mettre en place des bases solides pour un assainissement budgétaire durable <lb/>En raison de la lenteur de la croissance et d&apos;une situation budgétaire relativement médiocre, la dette publique du <lb/>Portugal était en augmentation depuis près d&apos;une décennie lorsque la crise mondiale a frappé, creusant sensiblement <lb/>le déficit. La perte de confiance dans les obligations souveraines du Portugal et des autres pays de la zone euro a <lb/>exigé un soutien financier international. Les mauvais résultats budgétaires reflètent un large éventail de problèmes <lb/>structurels se traduisant par un contrôle déficient des dépenses. Au niveau central comme au niveau local, ce dérapage <lb/>des dépenses a été aggravé par l&apos;accumulation non transparente d&apos;arriérés de paiement, d&apos;obligations de dépenses <lb/>futures au titre des partenariats public-privé (PPP) et de dettes extrabudgétaires contractées par les entreprises <lb/>publiques. En application du programme UE-FMI, les pouvoirs publics s&apos;emploient à mettre en oeuvre un plan <lb/>d&apos;assainissement ambitieux, intensif dans sa phase initiale et étayé par un large éventail de réformes structurelles. <lb/>Face à la faiblesse de la demande du secteur privé, la capacité des pouvoirs publics de regagner la maîtrise de <lb/>l&apos;évolution de la dette publique dépend de façon cruciale de la possibilité d&apos;éviter des dépassements de dépenses. Il <lb/>faudra pour cela renforcer le cadre budgétaire afin d&apos;améliorer le contrôle des dépenses, de limiter les arriérés de <lb/>paiement et d&apos;éviter d&apos;autres mauvaises surprises du côté des entreprises publiques déficitaires, des PPP et des <lb/>collectivités locales. Pour aboutir, le programme devra aussi préserver le consensus social dont il fait l&apos;objet, <lb/>notamment en tenant compte continument de ses incidences pour les pauvres. Si la croissance est bien inférieure aux <lb/>prévisions du programme, on pourrait laisser jouer les stabilisateurs automatiques au moins en partie pour réduire les <lb/>risques d&apos;un approfondissement de la récession et d&apos;une aggravation du chômage.

			<body>Portugal: Solid foundations for a sustainable fiscal consolidation <lb/>by David Haugh and Stéphane Sorbe 1 <lb/>Portugal has a long record of fiscal deficits. In the past two decades, the fiscal deficit never fell <lb/>significantly below 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), despite resort to one-offs to improve headline <lb/>figures. This situation, combined with weak growth, resulted in a gradual but sustained rise in public debt <lb/>since 2000. In 2009, debt increase shifted to a much steeper path as the deficit deteriorated dramatically to <lb/>10.2% of GDP (Figure 1). Rising debt, weakening growth prospects and turmoil in the euro area led to a <lb/>loss of investor confidence and access to long-term market finance at sustainable interest rates. Portugal <lb/>entered a European Union-International Monetary Fund (EU-IMF) financial assistance programme <lb/>(hereafter referred as the programme) in May 2011. <lb/>This paper discusses Portugal&apos;s fiscal situation and progress in dealing with the underlying drivers of <lb/>the weak fiscal position. The first section analyses the risks around debt sustainability, and how <lb/>consolidation should be designed to minimise harm to medium-term growth and maintain public support <lb/>for the programme. This is followed by a discussion of the fiscal framework including measures to <lb/>improve expenditure control. A final section covers efforts to deal with the large off-balance sheet <lb/>liabilities and inefficiencies built up in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public-private partnerships (PPPs) <lb/>and local government and with the use of EU structural funds. <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>The consolidation programme: how fast and with which instruments? <lb/>The speed of consolidation and risks around achieving debt sustainability <lb/>The government aims to reduce the public deficit to 4½ per cent of GDP in 2012 and 3% in 2013 as <lb/>part of the EU-IMF programme, and projects the public debt ratio to peak at 116% of GDP in 2013 and <lb/>then start declining (Table 1). Due to the need to make up for the large one-offs in 2011, such targets will <lb/>require a large underlying fiscal consolidation of about 3½ per cent of GDP in 2012 – almost twice as <lb/>much as in 2011 – and about 1½ per cent of GDP in 2013.. Under the OECD&apos;s central scenario of a <lb/>gradual economic recovery beginning in 2013, the ambitious fiscal stance envisaged by the authorities <lb/>would allow to rapidly regain control over public debt dynamics. However, there are risks of a deeper than <lb/>projected recession and lower government revenue, notably because of ongoing economic and financial <lb/>turbulence in the Euro Area, as well as the ongoing credit contraction in Portugal (Pina and Abreu, 2012). <lb/>Indeed, first data for 2012 showed a budget deficit of 7.9% for the first quarter on a seasonally unadjusted <lb/>basis because of lower indirect tax revenues and higher social transfers. In the case of lower than projected <lb/>growth, the question is whether the government should stick to nominal deficit targets, which risks further <lb/>amplifying the recession and being potentially self-defeating, or let automatic stabilisers play, which would <lb/>delay public debt stabilisation, with a risk to investor confidence. <lb/>Table 1.

These simulations rely on a small-sized stylised macroeconomic model inspired <lb/>by Lenain et al. (2010), in which random shocks affect macroeconomic variables following the approach <lb/>developed by Celasun et al. (2006). The model captures the mutual interdependences between the fiscal <lb/>position, financial conditions and activity and notably the impact of public debt developments on investors&apos; <lb/>confidence and interest rates. The fiscal multiplier, which has a large influence on the results, is assumed to <lb/>be one – a level that would be considered rather high in normal times, reflecting that depressed private <lb/>demand and tight credit may amplify the impact of fiscal consolidation (Corsetti et al., 2012; Boussard <lb/>et al., 2012). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

Stochastic simulation results <lb/>1. <lb/>Respecting the structural primary deficit targets. <lb/>2. <lb/>In the &quot; nominal targets &quot; strategy, the headline public balance is always equal to the targets presented in Table 1.1. Similarly, in <lb/>the &quot; automatic stabilisers &quot; strategy, the structural primary balance always follows targets implied by the programme. <lb/>Source: S. Sorbe (2012), &quot; Portugal: Assessing the Risks about the Speed of Fiscal Consolidation in an Uncertain Environment &quot; , <lb/>OECD Economics Department Working Papers, forthcoming. <lb/>The simulation results suggest that sticking to nominal deficit targets would put debt on a declining <lb/>path, but with a significant risk of a deep recession and an associated sharp rise in unemployment. In this <lb/>case, meeting nominal deficit targets would require large additional consolidation measures, which would <lb/>risk undermining social support for the programme in a context of high and rising unemployment. In <lb/>contrast, letting automatic stabilisers play would limit the risk of an extreme recession, but at the cost of <lb/>abandoning certainty over debt control. On balance, this suggests that the government should aim at <lb/>meeting its nominal fiscal targets (without resorting to one-offs) as long as growth does not deviate <lb/>substantially from the programme to reap the associated credibility gains.

			<body>substantially more than projected, the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to play, at least partially. <lb/>Debt simulations also show that risks around the fiscal consolidation programme would be minimised by <lb/>stimulating potential growth through structural reforms (Pina and Abreu, 2012) and by choosing &quot; growth <lb/>friendly &quot; fiscal consolidation instruments that would lower the fiscal multiplier (Annex A1). <lb/>Consolidation instruments, growth, equity and the environment <lb/>After a fiscal stimulus of around 1% of GDP in late 2008 and 2009, as part of the European economic <lb/>recovery plan, Portugal resumed fiscal consolidation in 2010 that gathered pace in 2011 and 2012. Two-<lb/>thirds of measures in 2011 and 2012 are on the expenditure side, largely through reductions in the public <lb/>sector wage bill via staff reductions as well as cuts in public sector wages. In addition the indexing of <lb/>pensions to inflation was suspended except for the lowest pensions. In early July 2012 the Portuguese <lb/>Constitutional Court ruled that the suspension of the 13th and 14th months paid to civil servants and <lb/>pensioners through to 2014 (accounting for approximately 1.1% of GDP of the consolidation package for <lb/>2012) violated the constitution because it does not apply to all citizens. Given the country&apos;s deficit target <lb/>commitments, the Court has nonetheless accepted that the suspension, as currently defined, can be applied <lb/>in 2012. The government is currently analysing the possible alternatives scenarios to incorporate the Court <lb/>decision into the budgetary plans beyond 2012. On the revenue side, amongst other measures, a personal <lb/>income tax surcharge was imposed on higher incomes (those in the highest tax bracket), the state surcharge <lb/>on corporate profits was increased, social security contributions were raised and value-added tax (VAT) <lb/>increased both by lifting the main rate and abolishing a concessionary rate on electricity and many other <lb/>items in 2012 (e.g. restaurants). Tax expenditures have been further reduced by cutting and capping tax <lb/>allowances for health, mortgage and rent expenditure and abolishing all concessionary corporate tax rates. <lb/>User charges including road tolls and public transport fares have been increased. <lb/>Consolidation instruments should be chosen so as to ensure a lasting improvement in the fiscal <lb/>balance, minimise negative effects on activity, spread fairly the burden of adjustment across the population <lb/>and, when relevant, help preserve the environment. In this respect, on the one hand, concentrating <lb/>consolidation measures on the expenditure side would have a stronger negative effect on short-run activity <lb/>as the impact of expenditure cuts is generally considered higher than tax increases (OECD, 2009a). On the <lb/>other hand, international experience shows that expenditure based consolidations tend to be more <lb/>successful, notably in terms of sustainability (Guichard et al., 2007). <lb/>On balance, the government will need to rely on both tax increases and expenditure restraints. Relying <lb/>on the least-distortive taxes will minimize the short-term cost of the adjustment. From that perspective, the <lb/>current consolidation package has a number of attractive features including raising revenue through <lb/>indirect tax increases (Arnold, 2008), broadening the tax base through reducing tax expenditures rather <lb/>than raising tax rates, and harmonising tax rates by suppressing certain concessionary rates. However, <lb/>consolidation should put greater weight on expenditure measures since excessive growth in expenditure <lb/>has been the main source of poor fiscal performance. In times of fiscal restraint, the emphasis should be on <lb/>improving spending efficiency, notably concerning SOEs and local governments, and, as has been the case, <lb/>on cutting current rather than capital expenditures as short and medium-term negative growth effects are <lb/>lower. <lb/>The burden of adjustment needs to be spread fairly to maintain social consensus around the <lb/>programme. In particular, continuing attention should be paid to its implications for the poorest. By design, <lb/>the reduction of certain tax credits, public sector pay cuts and income tax changes have affected high <lb/>income earners more, having clauses to protect the lowest income brackets. However, consolidations tend <lb/>to have adverse impacts on income distribution (Ahrend et al., 2011). Recent research suggests that <lb/>(excluding increases in indirect tax other than VAT and cuts in public services), between 2009 and <lb/>mid-2011, Portugal&apos;s package may have been more regressive than in five other EU countries examined <lb/></body>

			<body>(Callan et al., 2011). Indeed, the combined effect of the measures considered in this study reduced <lb/>disposable incomes of the two lowest income deciles in Portugal proportionally more than those of higher <lb/>income deciles, mainly as a result of pension and benefit cuts which hit the poorest harder. <lb/>The decision to impose tolls on formerly free highways is welcome as it raises revenue while also <lb/>benefiting the environment. The government is also planning, in tandem with municipalities, to develop a <lb/>package of measures to promote the use of public transport. Measures include extending bus lanes as well <lb/>as increasing parking restrictions and the cost of individual transport. The last is particularly welcome as <lb/>planned metro price increases would otherwise lead to passengers moving to other, more polluting, <lb/>transport forms. The authorities should be ambitious in this area, by for example widening the coverage of <lb/>and increasing parking fees, introducing congestion charges in Lisbon and making greater use of road tolls. <lb/>This would even up the competitive playing field between metro, rail and individual road transport, help to <lb/>reduce pollution and congestion, provide a source of funding for public transport and increase market <lb/>efficiency by bringing user costs closer to the social costs of individual road transport. Tolls should be set <lb/>as a part of a wider transport strategy that takes into account the environmental costs as well as the overall <lb/>costs and revenues arising from all transport state-owned enterprises including the rail companies. <lb/>Improving the fiscal framework <lb/>Portugal has a relatively poor record of achieving its budget targets, especially medium-term ones, <lb/>largely owing to a failure to adequately control expenditure. With the exception of the 2005-07 <lb/>consolidation, public expenditure has been allowed to rise more rapidly than GDP since 1998, when <lb/>Portugal&apos;s entry to the euro was confirmed, undermining the fiscal position (Figure 3). The failure to <lb/>control expenditure is partly a result of over-optimistic economic and revenue forecasts (Annex A2, which <lb/>is a widespread source of budgeting problems (OECD, 2011a), and assumptions on capital revenue <lb/>(Figure 4). It also reflects spending overruns, compounded by a failure to minimise risks arising from local <lb/>and regional government, the state-owned enterprise sector and public-private partnerships, as discussed <lb/>below. <lb/>A stronger fiscal framework would help to solve these problems. By enhancing credibility, it can also <lb/>help to reduce the need for sharp fiscal corrections that increase volatility of GDP growth in the short-run, <lb/>which in turn undermines the economy&apos;s long-run growth rate (Brzozowski and Siwinska-Gorzelak, 2010). <lb/>Portugal is overhauling its fiscal framework via the Budget Framework law of May 2011 and subsequent <lb/>legislation. The main elements include: a medium-term framework of budget planning that annually sets <lb/>expenditure ceilings for the central government for the next four years (November 2011); a general <lb/>government budget balance rule in line with European level requirements to have a structural deficit of no <lb/>more than 0.5% of GDP (after a transition period until 2014, during which the government will follow the <lb/>programme targets); establishing an independent fiscal council (October 2011); programme budgeting; and <lb/>expanding the State Budget to the whole of general government as defined in the national accounts. <lb/>Reforms of regional and local finances laws will also be presented before the end of 2012. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

Notably, the move towards a more medium-term focus is <lb/>welcome given that Portugal has hitherto been relatively weak in this area by international standards <lb/>(OECD, 2011a). However, ensuring that the framework really contributes to fiscal sustainability will <lb/>require meeting important implementation challenges. In addition, the framework would be more <lb/>transparent and easier to monitor if it were reinforced by a spending rule consistent with the structural <lb/>balance rule and the new European fiscal framework. An expenditure rule is easy to monitor, addresses <lb/>directly a major weakness of Portuguese fiscal policy, and would help to guide fiscal consolidation by <lb/>providing an overall expenditure envelope within which to plan programmes. <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>A.

Reporting <lb/>has been long, confusing and often repetitive. In addition, the accounts are cash based and have not used <lb/>the same definition of the general government as that used in the national accounts produced by the <lb/>National Statistics Institute (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). The Ministry of Finance has also in the past not <lb/>had sufficient information about the sources of potential liabilities including SOEs and PPPs (particularly <lb/>at the local level) and local and regional government finances on a sufficiently frequent basis (OECD, <lb/>2008a). Additionally, data on health spending and local and regional government accounts was previously <lb/>only available quarterly. This has prevented the government from being able to get a timely picture of the <lb/>overall general government position and risks to it. <lb/>Information flows are improving. The move to monthly reporting for all parts of general government <lb/>is welcome. The broadening of the reporting universe in the State Budget to all entities included in the <lb/>general government will also help the monitoring of the overall state of the government sector and improve <lb/>international comparability. The government also plans to overhaul the accounting system, moving to a set <lb/>of accrual based accounts containing results that can be compared across expenditure areas, which is <lb/>welcome. More recently the Ministry of Finance has produced annual and quarterly reports on SOEs and <lb/>PPPs at the central government level and some basic financial and operational information about individual <lb/>SOEs is also provided. In addition, in line with programme requirements, the government produced a range <lb/>of new reports including ones covering arrears, the 36 most important PPP contracts as well as <lb/>24 concessions. This excluded the PPP programme in the autonomous region of Madeira, which ran into <lb/>serious difficulties in 2011 with one of the three PPPs in the region having been reclassified within general <lb/>government resulting in fiscal implications at the general government level. <lb/>As recommended by the 2008 OECD Review of Budgeting in Portugal, the government is moving <lb/>towards a programme budgeting approach. The State Budget will be structured around 14 programmes, <lb/>each with a single implementing ministry. Also in line with OECD Budgeting Review recommendations, <lb/>each minister will be responsible for strict compliance with the budgetary limits set for their respective <lb/>ministry. Importantly, ministers will be liable for correcting any shortfall and failure to do so will result in <lb/>lower budget allowances in the following year. In addition, each minister has appointed a programme <lb/>financial controller to interact with the Ministry of Finance in monitoring and controlling budget <lb/>implementation (Ministry of Finance, 2011a). <lb/>-3 <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>-3 <lb/>-2 <lb/>-1 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>Jan. <lb/>2001 <lb/>Dec. <lb/>2001 <lb/>Jan. <lb/>2003 <lb/>Dec. <lb/>2003 <lb/>June <lb/>2005 <lb/>Dec. <lb/>2005 <lb/>Dec. <lb/>2006 <lb/>Dec. <lb/>2007 <lb/>Jan. <lb/>2009 <lb/>Mar. <lb/>2010 <lb/>Stability and Growth Programme <lb/>First year of forecast (t)¹ <lb/>t + 1 <lb/>t + 2 <lb/>t + 3 <lb/></body>

			<body>The move to programme budgeting will help tackle the problem of fragmentation and assist the <lb/>Ministry of Finance to move away from detailed control of budget execution, which should reside with <lb/>individual ministries, towards more strategic global oversight and reviews of financial performance. <lb/>Programme budgeting will also complement the new medium-term expenditure framework discussed <lb/>below by providing a better system for ensuring spending remains within the framework limits. <lb/>Once programme budgeting is fully embedded, the government should move towards improving <lb/>performance information. A new OECD index shows that Portugal has a relatively under-developed budget <lb/>performance information system by international standards (OECD, 2011a). Initial efforts should <lb/>concentrate on developing a small set of internationally comparable output and outcome indicators that can <lb/>be monitored over time against benchmarks in key expenditure areas such as health and education. This <lb/>information can be used to go beyond just controlling expenditure within set limits but assist in <lb/>reallocating expenditure to increase efficiency. <lb/>It is also important that the authorities fully implement the new system of intra-annual expenditure <lb/>commitment controls based around the 14 new budget programmes. In the past, spending slippage <lb/>occurred because spending units were allowed to spend excessively on the basis of over-optimistic <lb/>forecasts of their own revenues, while no corrective action was taken when these revenues failed to <lb/>materialise. The new system aims to remedy this. If spending exceeds the forecast revenue envelope in a <lb/>three month period, this will have to be offset by more ambitious spending targets to correct this over the <lb/>budget year. A potential issue is that the technical capability of programme financial controllers to carry <lb/>out these oversight functions and interact with the Ministry of Finance varies a lot across other ministries. <lb/>To instil a greater sense of responsibility, financial controllers should be appointments assigned to named <lb/>individuals rather than simply a function assigned to the head of the planning unit for example. In addition, <lb/>they should have sufficient time to properly carry out these functions and have access to analytical support <lb/>staff, which is not the case for all ministries. <lb/>Further efforts are also needed to reduce payment arrears. Arrears of the general government sector, <lb/>as well as the SOEs outside the general government sector, are high by international standards. The 2011 <lb/>European Payments Index showed that the average payment delay by the public sector was the fourth <lb/>highest out of 25 countries (Intrum Justitia, 2011). In early 2012, total arrears including those of SOE <lb/>hospitals were around 3.2% of GDP. Controlling arrears is important as they are part of government debt in <lb/>the wider sense (although they are not directly accounted in Maastricht debt) and, are a burden on private <lb/>sector capital resources and thus on economic activity. The 2012 Supplementary Budget allocated <lb/>EUR 1.5 billion (0.9% of GDP) for the settlement of existing arrears for the hospital sector, which is <lb/>expected to be paid out by August. To prevent the build up of new arrears in 2012, the government has <lb/>concentrated on providing adequate allocations to the health sector, where around 40% of the arrears have <lb/>been concentrated. In addition, incentives are built into the newly introduced commitment control system <lb/>to pay back arrears, as entities with spending arrears are forced to adopt more ambitious spending targets. <lb/>The government has also committed to help local governments settle part of their existing arrears via a <lb/>EUR 1 billion (0.6% of GDP) credit line, as discussed below. <lb/>Medium-term budgeting and anchoring the framework <lb/>Medium term budgeting has been insufficient, as Portugal was ranked second lowest on this issue out <lb/>of 30 OECD countries in 2007 (OECD, 2009b; OECD, 2011a). This ranking takes into account a set of <lb/>variables including the presence of multi-year expenditure estimates in the annual budget. The <lb/>government&apos;s move to a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework is therefore welcome. The <lb/>medium-term expenditure framework can help to improve transparency in fiscal policy by showing how <lb/>targets will be achieved as well as the multi-year consequences of spending and revenue plans. The latter <lb/>restricts the scope to use expenditure shifting across years to hide unfavourable trends. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>In the new framework, the government has committed to submit to parliament annually expenditure <lb/>ceilings for the following four years. In the first year (the budget year) these ceilings will be expressed by <lb/>the individual 14 programmes, for the second year they will be grouped by policy intervention areas, while <lb/>only an overall ceiling will apply for the third and fourth years. The government should extend the period <lb/>of individual programme ceilings beyond the first year. The extended ceilings could in addition be linked <lb/>to specific measures, thereby giving the framework more credibility. The medium-term expenditure <lb/>framework should be part of a broader medium-term economic and fiscal plan. Such a plan should include <lb/>estimates for expenditure and revenue year by year and the specific measures that will be used to achieve <lb/>targets. It is also important that the assumptions underpinning the plan are transparently laid out to give it <lb/>credibility and allow effective monitoring by the Fiscal Council, the Parliament and the wider public. <lb/>Fiscal rules <lb/>In the same way as an annual budget, a medium-term expenditure framework can be adjusted every <lb/>year, which limits its scope to discipline fiscal policy decision making. Thus, fiscal rules would be a useful <lb/>complement that could be used to enforce the framework and achieve a medium-term fiscal target. They <lb/>may also help to increase financial market confidence in the government&apos;s commitment to its medium-term <lb/>plan. However, a poor track record of compliance with fiscal rules so far (the Stability and Growth Pact) <lb/>means that the latter benefit may take some time to materialise for Portugal. <lb/>Recent and on-going decisions at the EU level in the context of the euro sovereign debt crisis have <lb/>increased the number and overall strictness of common fiscal rules. There is now a complex web of four <lb/>partially overlapping rules: the excessive deficit rule that requires the deficit to be below 3% of GDP; a <lb/>debt convergence rule requiring the gross debt in excess of 60% of GDP to be reduced on average by at <lb/>least 1/20th per year; an expenditure rule which constrains expenditure to increase by no more that the <lb/>growth of potential GDP (with a lower reference rate for countries with a structural deficit below the <lb/>medium-term objective – benchmark is a structural deficit of no more than 0.5% of GDP) unless there are <lb/>explicit revenue raising measures; and a structural balance rule to reduce the annual structural deficit to <lb/>below 0.5% of GDP in steps to be determined by the European Commission. In the case of Portugal these <lb/>steps are already pre-determined through to 2014 by the EU-IMF programme. <lb/>Which rule is the binding constraint depends on circumstances, but recent EU communication has <lb/>mainly focused on the structural balance rule (see European Council, 2011), which Portugal has enshrined <lb/>in the new 2011 Budget Framework law. The new rule will apply from 2015 with the programme targets <lb/>governing the path for the fiscal balance up until 2014. Rules should tackle as directly as possible the <lb/>underlying source of the weak fiscal position (Sutherland et al., 2012), which in the case of Portugal is a <lb/>failure to control primary expenditure (Hauptmeier et al., 2011). Rules also need to be not unduly rigid <lb/>(Schick, 2010), easily understood and monitored by the parliament and public, have broad coverage and be <lb/>operationalised easily. On this basis, Portugal should also legislate an explicit expenditure rule that limits <lb/>public expenditure growth relative to the estimated growth rate of potential nominal GDP (as estimated <lb/>ex ante), and use this to set enforceable nominal expenditure ceilings for general government to facilitate <lb/>monitoring. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>Historical experience suggests countries with multiple rules have been more successful in carrying out <lb/>consolidations and stabilising debt (Guichard et al., 2007; IMF, 2009; Sutherland et al., 2012). Concerns <lb/>about over-determining fiscal policy with multiple rules can be mitigated by parameterising such a <lb/>numerical expenditure rule to be consistent with the structural balance rule obligation – the change in the <lb/>balance being approximately equal to the difference between the growth rate of expenditure and potential <lb/>nominal GDP weighted by the expenditure share in GDP. 2 With the current need to consolidate the fiscal <lb/>position, this would require setting expenditure growth below potential nominal GDP growth for many <lb/>years, which would be in line with the EU level expenditure rule obligation. <lb/>An expenditure rule provides a way of making the structural balance rule operational because <lb/>performance against the expenditure rule can be judged against a simple observable target, expenditure, <lb/>whereas the structural balance cannot be observed, but only estimated, with estimates typically revised <lb/>significantly over time. Experience elsewhere suggests that the ease of observing compliance becomes an <lb/>important issue in practice. For example, the Swedish Fiscal Policy council found it difficult to assess <lb/>compliance with the government&apos;s target of a 1% surplus over the cycle (Calmfors, 2010). Disputes over <lb/>when the cycle started and finished were among the most contentious aspects of the &quot; over the cycle &quot; rule <lb/>that operated in the United Kingdom until the end of 2008 (OECD, 2009c). The potential gains from an <lb/>expenditure rule are demonstrated by simulations showing that, if Portugal had followed this type of rule <lb/>from 1999 to 2009 using real time data and limited primary expenditure growth to an estimate of potential <lb/>nominal GDP growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been 17 percentage points of GDP lower by 2009 <lb/>(Hauptmeier et al., 2011). <lb/>Establishing a fiscal council <lb/>A fiscal council can complement fiscal rules by providing a body to assess whether the government is <lb/>complying with them. A council can also help to give flexibility to fiscal rules and suggest improvements <lb/>to them (Calmfors and Wren Lewis, 2011). In October 2011, the government passed legislation <lb/>establishing an independent fiscal council. This is welcome, as it will bring independent, intellectually <lb/>rigorous scrutiny to fiscal policy. The Council comprises five senior council members of which two may <lb/>be non-Portuguese citizens, as well as a secretariat of analytical support staff. The board members were <lb/>appointed by the end of 2011 with analytical staff appointments taking place in 2012. A first report was <lb/>issued in May 2012, focusing on the broad aspects of the government&apos;s budgetary strategy (Portuguese <lb/>Public Finance Council, 2012). The Council&apos;s main recommendations were for the government to hand <lb/>over responsibility for macroeconomic forecasts to an independent institution and, as recommended in this <lb/>Survey, set expenditure ceilings for general government. <lb/>The Council has a very wide remit. In addition to what are becoming standard tasks for these <lb/>institutions internationally of assessing central government macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and <lb/>compliance with fiscal rules, the Council also has responsibility for assessing the financial position of local <lb/>governments and state owned enterprises and analysing existing commitments including, pensions, health <lb/>care, public-private partnerships and tax expenditures. The government is required by law to provide to the <lb/>Council in a timely manner all economic and financial information it requires to complete its mission. The <lb/>law also requires the Council&apos;s reports to be sent to the President of the Republic, the government, the <lb/>2. <lb/>More exactly, assuming a constant elasticity of revenue to GDP: <lb/>) <lb/>2 <lb/>/ <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>( <lb/>* <lb/>) <lb/>2 <lb/>( <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>t <lb/>g <lb/>g <lb/>GDP <lb/>EXP <lb/>GDP <lb/>EXP <lb/>sb <lb/>α <lb/>α <lb/>α <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>∆ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>where ∆sb is the change in the structural balance, EXP is expenditure, GDP is nominal potential GDP, g is the <lb/>growth rate of nominal potential GDP and α is the growth rate of total expenditure. <lb/></body>

			<body>parliament, the Court of Auditors and the central bank. The Council is a complementary fiscal institution to <lb/>the Parliamentary technical budget support unit (UTAO) set up in 2006. In this context, it will be important <lb/>to ensure regular information exchanges with this unit. The design of the fiscal council has already drawn <lb/>on this unit&apos;s experience and should continue to do so, particularly in interacting with the parliament which <lb/>will be a key client of the Council. <lb/>The provision to allow for up to two non-Portuguese citizens on the board will widen the range of <lb/>perspectives. However, the government should relax the prohibition on board members having other paid <lb/>activity. Other countries allow board members to hold concurrent positions and the prohibition is a serious <lb/>constraint on recruitment where some of the potential candidates could be academics or economists in <lb/>policy organisations who would be reluctant to fully give up their current jobs. <lb/>The Council&apos;s broad remit appropriately recognises that fiscal problems at the general government <lb/>level can often arise outside the central government as has occurred in Portugal in recent years. However, it <lb/>will be important to ensure resources available to the Council are commensurate with its wide remit. The <lb/>Council will require significant analytic and specialised resources to meet the challenge of giving advice <lb/>across such a broad range of areas. In the first instance the Council should prioritise core functions, <lb/>including assessing the macroeconomic and fiscal projections, compliance with fiscal rules and giving <lb/>fiscal policy recommendations to the government. Assessing the forecasts is an important task as <lb/>international experience shows that over-optimistic macroeconomic forecasts are a notable source of <lb/>deficit bias (Hagemann, 2010). Furthermore, there is evidence that Fiscal Councils that provide policy <lb/>recommendations rather than just analysis are more effective (Debrun et al., 2009). Concentrating efforts <lb/>will also help the Council to establish a reputation for high quality non-partisan work and therefore cement <lb/>its role in the national debate and policy process. <lb/>Giving the Council strong power to request information from the government is also welcome, as <lb/>limited access to important fiscal information has reduced the effectiveness of councils elsewhere (Kopits, <lb/>2011). The Council&apos;s role should be further embedded in the policy debate by requiring the Minister of <lb/>Finance to provide a formal response, including appearing before the Parliamentary Finance Committee, to <lb/>Fiscal Council reports. Finally, the Council should engage early in developing communication channels, <lb/>particularly with the media which are the main channel of influence of the Council as it can only persuade <lb/>and not coerce (Kopits, 2011). <lb/>The budgetary process provides only short periods for scrutiny of the Budget (OECD, 2008a). This is <lb/>inconsistent with OECD guidelines on budget transparency (OECD, 2002), which suggest that the <lb/>parliament should have three months to scrutinise the budget rather than the current one and a half months. <lb/>This meant that the Parliamentary technical budget support unit (UTAO) had only ten calendar days to <lb/>analyse the State Budget and eight days for the Stability Programme annual update. This constraint will <lb/>also affect the new Fiscal Council as there have been no changes to extend the parliamentary timetables to <lb/>approve the budget. Given the complexity of the budget and the severe implications of mistakes, the <lb/>government should extend the time available to the Fiscal Council to analyse and report on the budget <lb/>beyond that which was available to UTAO. This will help to ensure the Council can properly fulfil its <lb/>functions. <lb/>Public sector efficiency and off-balance sheet liabilities <lb/>Raising the game of the SOE sector <lb/>Although previous privatisations have reduced the size of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, in <lb/>2010 it still accounted for 4.5% of GDP and 3.5% of employment (DGTF, 2011a), (Figure 6). The <lb/>corporatisation of a high proportion of hospitals partly explains this, as they represent more than half of <lb/>SOE employees. More recently restructuring in the SOE sector has seen staff levels decline in areas such <lb/>as the transport sector where personnel declined by 12% in the second half of 2011. The poor performance <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></note>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>of the SOE sector overall is illustrated by the EUR 1.9 billion (1.1% of GDP) loss by the sector in 2011 on <lb/>total assets of EUR 55.8 billion (32% of GDP). Poor performance of enterprises classified inside the <lb/>general government sector, which account for most of the losses, directly affects the government&apos;s <lb/>accounts. Those located outside general government represent a contingent liability, which may move on <lb/>budget in the case of their reclassification to the general government sector or trigger a need to support <lb/>them with debt guarantees or capital injections. <lb/>Figure 6. Employment in state-owned enterprises <lb/>Employees in SOEs in per cent of total employment, 2009 <lb/>1 <lb/>1. <lb/>Or latest year available. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) cover firms that are majority owned by the government or those where <lb/>the government owns at least 10% of the common share capital listed. <lb/>Source: H. Christiansen (2011), &quot; The Size and Composition of the SOE Sector in OECD Countries &quot; , OECD Corporate Governance <lb/>Working Papers, No. 5. <lb/>Many SOEs have been financially underperforming. Losses have been large in the urban passenger <lb/>transport, rail and hospital sub-sectors (Figure 7). This partly reflects extremely high debt and associated <lb/>debt servicing costs. Several of these companies are technically insolvent and the SOE sector as a whole <lb/>has negative equity of EUR 2 billion. Nearly all of these loss-making companies (Carris, a public transport <lb/>company, is an exception) are also making losses on an EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes, <lb/>depreciation and amortisation) indicating that they are also operationally weak. <lb/>The reclassification by Eurostat of three SOEs as part of the general government sector has increased <lb/>the urgency of solving these problems as their losses now have an immediate impact on the fiscal balance <lb/>and debt. The reclassified companies are among the largest loss making SOEs (the rail track company, <lb/>REFER, and the Lisbon and Porto metro companies), adding around ½ per cent of GDP to the fiscal deficit <lb/>between 2007 and 2010 (Statistics Portugal, 2011; Ministry of Finance, 2011b). Occasional capital <lb/>transfers from government to SOEs have been used to prop up ailing enterprises and prolong this process. <lb/>However, experience shows this former strategy is not sustainable in the medium-run as Eurostat will <lb/>reclassify particularly bad loss making enterprises as part of the general government sector, in which case <lb/>the liability is immediately made explicit. <lb/>Running SOEs at a loss in sectors such as urban transport and health care and building up off balance <lb/>sheet liabilities, including in the case of hospitals through payment arrears, reflected a non-transparent <lb/>subsidisation of government services. In the short-run, lower priced but potentially inefficient services are <lb/>delivered to the population without recognising explicitly the associated public cost. Alternatively, the debt <lb/>of the SOE may become so large that it does not have enough free cash flow to pay suppliers and creditors <lb/>and therefore to operate commercially. Operating the SOE sector in this way has also had negative <lb/>externalities in the form of creating government guaranteed debtors that crowd out private sector <lb/>borrowing and investment (Pina and Abreu, 2012). <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>14 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>14 <lb/>AUS CANKOR NLD CHL ESP DNK ISR NZL DEU ITA GBR BEL CHE PRT AUT CZE EST HUNSWEFRA FIN NOR <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

At issue are which enterprises the government should continue to own and how the performance <lb/>and governance of these remaining companies can be improved. Part of the programme conditions are to <lb/>privatise a number of enterprises including Aeroportos de Portugal (ANA), the national airline (TAP), the <lb/>national postal service, Correios de Portugal (CTT), railway freight branch (CP Cargo), the insurance arm <lb/>of a government bank (Caixa Seguros). The sale timetable is ambitious, with all of these assets <lb/>programmed to be sold by early 2013. By mid-2012, the government had already executed the partial sale <lb/>of REN and the sale of its remaining stake in the former electricity generating incumbent (EDP) and <lb/>initiated the sale of ANA and TAP. The government had also announced that it intends to grant <lb/>concessions to run the newly merged Lisbon metro and road public transport services companies as well as <lb/>rail services. A partial sale of the television channel (RTP) along with a concession to run the water <lb/>company Águas de Portugal (AdP) is being considered. <lb/>With the exception of the airline, TAP, the companies that are to be sold are profitable, which should <lb/>increase the chances of prompt sales. In addition, they are engaged in commercial activities that the private <lb/>sector can be expected to provide. The government should prioritise maximising the contribution to <lb/>Portugal&apos;s long-term growth potential from the sale of these assets over a quick sale, especially at a time of <lb/>crisis, when conditions for asset sales may not be the best. In any case, these are complex assets operating <lb/>in industries where a healthy competitive market cannot be taken for granted due to natural monopoly <lb/>characteristics and other barriers to entry. This means that a straight sale of these assets risks transforming <lb/>public monopolies into private ones, with no real possibility of competition entering the market. An <lb/>important part of privatisation will therefore be to ensure that the company structure and the regulatory <lb/>framework are pro-competitive prior to any sale. For example, the government should consider splitting <lb/>some of these firms into competing companies before selling them, even if this may delay sales. The <lb/>government should also involve the competition authority in the design of the sale and the regulatory <lb/>framework. <lb/>-600 <lb/>-400 <lb/>-200 <lb/>0 <lb/>200 <lb/>Net profit <lb/>-3000 -2000 -1000 <lb/>0 <lb/>1000 2000 <lb/>Equity <lb/>EP (Roads) <lb/>CTT (Post) <lb/>Port Administration <lb/>AdP (Water) <lb/>ANA (Airports) <lb/>Parpública <lb/>Media <lb/>Urban and environment <lb/>Carris (Transport) <lb/>TAP (Airline) <lb/>Other infrastructure <lb/>Refer (Rail tracks) <lb/>CP (Rail) <lb/>Porto Metro <lb/>Health² <lb/>Lisbon Metro <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

			<body>In terms of operational performance the government is developing a strategy for all SOEs with <lb/>commercial activities (excluding the rail track company REFER and the health sector) to achieve <lb/>operational balance by the end of 2012. Part of this are plans to reduce operational costs by at least 15% <lb/>through decreasing the cost of supplies, external services and labour (DGTF, 2011a). The elimination of <lb/>the 13th and 14th month salaries for all public sector employees including those in SOEs plays a major role <lb/>in the latter. In the short-run redundancy costs resulting from cuts in staff will temporarily slowdown <lb/>improvement. <lb/>The losses of the Lisbon and Porto metro companies are so large that they are noticeable at an overall <lb/>government budget level, with a combined net financial loss of EUR 980 million (0.5% of GDP) in 2011, <lb/>of which more than half represented an operational loss. For the Lisbon metro a fundamental problem is <lb/>that payments to suppliers and particularly staff have been increasing faster than sales revenue. From 2005 <lb/>to 2010 staff payments rose by 18% and revenue from sales only rose by 7%. To prevent further <lb/>deterioration in operational results, payments to staff will need to be far more tightly controlled. The Porto <lb/>metro has had more success in cutting supplier costs and operational revenue coverage of costs improved <lb/>between 2009 and 2010. To help close the gap between revenue and costs further, prices were significantly <lb/>increased (by around 20%) for urban public transport in 2011 and the government&apos;s strategy is to increase <lb/>them over time to comparable EU levels. <lb/>The national rail track company, REFER and the national operator of train services, Comboios de <lb/>Portugal (CP), are also making large operational losses. Durably improving their operational performance <lb/>may require further rationalising networks by closing underutilised and unprofitable lines and replacing <lb/>them with bus services (where these are viable). Indeed, most of CP passenger&apos;s past operational losses <lb/>have been incurred by CP regional in providing only 20% of CP&apos;s total available seat kilometres. Train <lb/>services should only be provided on lines with high traffic density as the large fixed costs incurred in <lb/>providing rail services mean the combined costs of CP and REFER per passenger kilometre rise drastically <lb/>as total passenger kilometres on a line fall. On this basis, four lines were closed in 2009 and replaced with <lb/>bus services that can be provided at a small fraction of the cost of train services (Ministry of the Economy, <lb/>2011). From 2011 through to mid 2012 a further 410 kilometres of underperforming parts of the network <lb/>were deactivated. The government should continue to rationalise the network to eliminate remaining high <lb/>cost lines to further reduce operational losses. Improving CP operational performance would also give <lb/>more scope to raise infrastructure charges paid by the freight operation (scheduled for privatisation) to <lb/>REFER and thereby reduce the losses of REFER. <lb/>Currently the revenue REFER earns from train operators is far below the costs of providing rail <lb/>infrastructure and does not even cover staff costs. By international comparison, REFER&apos;s charges for <lb/>utilising and managing infrastructure are below average overall and particularly for freight (Figure 8). <lb/>A constraint on improving the bottom-line are EU network access pricing rules which prevent REFER <lb/>from raising track access charges to recover the large investment costs it has incurred in recent times to <lb/>modernise the network. The company has announced it wants to reduce losses through a 35% cut in staff <lb/>and also other expenses in 2012. To help ensure this cost cutting is sustainable the government should <lb/>continue to close the most unprofitable tracks in tandem with the rationalisation of train services by CP. <lb/>However, cutting costs and raising prices may not close the financial gap of certain public transport <lb/>companies, meaning that they would have to rely on subsidies. This may be economically justifiable as <lb/>those travelling on public transport generate positive externalities relatively to travelling by car. <lb/>Nevertheless, in line with OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises, it is <lb/>important that this subsidy is explicitly set and shown in the government&apos;s accounts in return for an agreed <lb/>level of services, rather than via an accumulation of non-transparent losses. The public transport companies <lb/>should be required to achieve at least operational balance after subsidies under such an agreement or face <lb/>immediate corrective actions to restore balance. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2012)62 <lb/></body>

In some cases the <lb/>debt has reached such high levels that it cannot easily be repaid. To put these SOEs back in a commercially <lb/>viable position, their debt needs to be reduced to serviceable levels while avoiding future moral hazard <lb/>through a better governance regime. The government is preparing a plan to tackle the debt burden issue <lb/>that is due in July. To ensure this process is transparent the government should consider a one-off transfer <lb/>of part of SOE debt to a government entity charged with repaying it from government revenues assigned to <lb/>this entity for this purpose. <lb/>The government is introducing a new legal framework for SOEs and has plans to improve SOE <lb/>governance. A new law changing the way SOE managers are recruited and remunerated was passed in <lb/>January 2012 and further reforms are planned. A draft law to be considered by the parliament and applying <lb/>to central and local SOEs envisages a new technical unit to monitor SOEs and to inter alia advise ex ante <lb/>on whether establishing new SOEs is in the public interest. The government&apos;s plan to ensure the new <lb/>framework also tackles the capability and authority of SOEs to enter into derivative contracts is welcome <lb/>as a large contributor to the losses of the metro companies is from bets on interest rate derivatives which <lb/>should have been used exclusively as a hedging tool. <lb/>Public-private partnerships have created a significant future drain on fiscal resources <lb/>From 1990 to 2010 Portugal was the third biggest user of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in <lb/>Europe, after the United Kingdom and Spain and the highest user relative to GDP (Kappeler and Nemoz, <lb/>2010; EPEC, 2010; Figure 9). Accumulated investment in PPPs increased from EUR 9.3 billion in 2005 to <lb/>EUR 16.2 billion (9.5% of GDP) in 2011 (DGTF, 2011a). As elsewhere in continental Europe, the vast <lb/>bulk (79%) of these projects were roads, with rail (18%) and health (2%) accounting for most of the <lb/>remainder (Kappeler and Nemoz, 2010). <lb/>Concerning roads, a variety of private-partnership models were introduced in three main waves <lb/>(Table 2). Estradas de Portugal (EP), a 100% state-owned company that is classified within general <lb/>government, is the government&apos;s principal road concessionaire. EP has in turn granted sub-concessions to <lb/>private partners. In 2010 and 2011, the government negotiated with private partners to convert all the <lb/> &quot; shadow &quot; toll roads -where the government paid tolls on behalf of users -to standard toll roads where <lb/>users are charged a toll.

			<body>The large PPP programme has created a significant and growing payment obligation for the <lb/>government (Figure 10). The PPP payment obligations have a net present value of EUR 10.7 billion (6.3% <lb/>of GDP) in 2012 and yearly payments are projected to rise from EUR 1 billion in 2012 to EUR 1.5 billion <lb/>by 2015 as new roads currently under construction are completed. The payment problem has become more <lb/>acute with the sovereign debt crisis as EP can no longer access market finance (despite being operationally <lb/>profitable) and is therefore fully reliant on financing from the central government. <lb/>Figure 10. Net public-private partnership payments by the government <lb/>Per cent of GDP <lb/>Source: DGTF (2010), &quot; Public Private Partnerships and Concessions 2010 Report &quot; and DGTF (2011), Boletim Informativo Parcerias <lb/>Público-Privadas e Concessões 4.º Trimestre 2011, Direcção – Geral do Tesouro e Finanças; and Ministry of Finance (2011), <lb/>Orçamento do Estado para 2012, Relatório. <lb/>Significant risk surrounds these net payment projections. Net payments by the government were 20% <lb/>higher than forecast in both 2011 and 2010 albeit essentially due to one-off factors. The largest risks lie in <lb/>transport PPPs (road and rail) arising from assumptions such as traffic flows (DGTF, 2011b). Indeed, there <lb/>are some signs that toll revenue projections could prove too optimistic. Although this is difficult to separate <lb/>from recessionary effects, demand appears to have reacted strongly to the introduction of real tolls on <lb/>former shadow toll roads, with traffic declining by half on one of them. The allocation of risk between <lb/>public and private parties is complex and depends on the particular PPP. In general, for road design, <lb/>building and maintenance, availability and raising finance risk usually lie with the private sector as well as <lb/>demand for private concessions for real toll roads (DGTF, 2011b). <lb/>The government carries demand risk in the case of EP sub-concessions where the government <lb/>receives toll revenue from users, which are now the dominant concession model. In addition, under <lb/>contracts signed prior to 2003 the government carried the risk of extra costs of having to relocate to <lb/>different land for a road corridor, for example due to environmental reasons, which was part of the reason <lb/>PPP payments exceeded forecasts in both 2010 and 2011. Generally the government should only transfer <lb/>risks to the private sector that the private sector can control such as construction risk (Araújo and <lb/>Sutherland, 2010). In the case of roads it is arguable that the private partner can influence demand, for <lb/>example through road quality, and therefore should bear at least some of this risk rather than transferring <lb/>all of it to the government as has been done with the EP concessions. <lb/>As part of the programme, no new PPP contract will be signed in the short term and the pressing <lb/>policy issue is to reduce future costs and risks arising from existing PPPs. The government has already <lb/>taken action to start reducing its obligations. In the rail area, the three high speed train (TGV) projects <lb/>(Lisbon-Porto and Porto-Vigo and the link to Spain) have been cancelled. In the roads area, the conversion <lb/>of former shadow toll roads to toll roads is a welcome addition to revenue for these projects and the <lb/>government should extend coverage to the approximately 200 kilometres of highway that is currently not <lb/>designated for tolls yet. The government has also engaged an international accounting firm to report in <lb/>June in more detail the contingent liabilities under the PPPs and the probability of these materialising.

			<body>also assessed the costs and benefits of further renegotiation of the PPP contracts. To resolve existing PPPs, <lb/>a mixture of measures could be taken, depending on the exact circumstances of each PPP including: <lb/>renegotiating terms; cancelling projects when still at an early stage; or the buying back of PPP roads <lb/>(Reis, 2012). <lb/>In the future, PPPs can still potentially be a useful model for delivery services, particularly when there <lb/>is a positive externality between the construction and operating phases, which gives incentives for the <lb/>private sector to internalise the costs of service provision and asset maintenance in its decisions at the <lb/>construction phase (Araújo and Sutherland, 2010). However, they should be chosen because they represent <lb/>good value for money and not to postpone expenditure. The literature and international experience suggest <lb/>a number of factors that can help to ensure that a PPP is the right delivery model and maximises value for <lb/>money. These include specifying contracts in terms of outputs instead of inputs in order to maximise the <lb/>benefits of private sector technical expertise and management skills; an ex ante evaluation of PPP versus <lb/>public procurement; a public body obtaining planning and environmental permissions in advance of tender <lb/>to avoid delays; and proper fiscal accounting for PPPs including recording them in contingent liabilities <lb/>(Araújo and Sutherland, 2010). <lb/>By international standards, the efficiency enhancing features of Portugal&apos;s PPP framework appear <lb/>relatively strong on paper and the government is intending further improvements (Figure 11). It is setting <lb/>up a technical unit of around ten PPP experts in the Ministry of Finance to advise the minister on all <lb/>aspects of launching, designing and monitoring PPP projects where investment exceeds EUR 25 million. <lb/>This is welcome, as expertise is a key constraint on getting the most out of the PPP model. Similar units <lb/>exist in Ireland and Italy. Such a unit can also have useful role in spreading knowledge to local <lb/>government, which has less experience in managing PPPs. <lb/>Figure 11. Indicator of efficiency constraining features of public-private partnership frameworks <lb/>Index scale of 0-6 from least to most restrictive, 2008 <lb/>Source: S. Araújo and D. Sutherland (2010), &quot; Public-Private Partnerships and Investment in Infrastructure &quot; , OECD Economics <lb/>Department Working Papers, No. 803. <lb/>However, past experience shows that it is important that the new framework is actually implemented <lb/>and in particular that analysis done by the unit is fully taken into account by political decisions. In this <lb/>regard, the government&apos;s intention that all PPP project proposals will be compared against an ordinary <lb/>public procurement alternative and the results made publicly available and presented to the parliament is <lb/>welcome. In addition, there is a need for a proper assessment of the full implications for the budget <lb/>position of PPPs over their whole life-cycle and the government should further reform how PPPs are <lb/>included in the budget planning by accounting for capital expenditure on them on the same basis as the <lb/>alternative of an ordinary public investment. <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>CZE AUT BEL IRL PRT CAN KOR FRA DEU MEX ITA HUN AUS USA JPN ESP NOR TUR SVK <lb/></body>

			<body>Local and regional governments&apos; debt issues are leading the central government to step in <lb/>Portugal is a fairly centralised country (Box 1), but subnational government nevertheless poses <lb/>important fiscal issues. Since 2009, local and regional authorities have faced declining revenues, due to <lb/>cuts in central government transfers and depressed tax receipts, particularly on housing transactions. They <lb/>reacted by cutting spending, but not rapidly enough to prevent the accumulation of debt (Figure 12). The <lb/>total deficit of local government (including autonomous regions) reached 0.8% of GDP in 2009-10, before <lb/>halving in 2011. Local debt has risen to a high international level (Figure 13) and local governments have <lb/>lost access to long-term bank credit in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis. As a result, a large number of <lb/>municipalities as well as the region of Madeira have accumulated unsustainable short-term debt and <lb/>payment arrears, notably through local public companies. This makes it difficult to assess the total extent <lb/>of their liabilities, although audits carried out by the central government in the first half of 2012 resulted in <lb/>significant progress in this direction. <lb/>Box 1. The structure of Portuguese subnational government <lb/>There are no elected regional governments on the mainland, meaning that local government is essentially <lb/>concentrated at the municipal level and in the two autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira. Municipalities are <lb/>relatively large by European standards (34 000 inhabitants on average) and are subdivided into civil parishes in charge <lb/>of lower administrative functions. More precisely, Portugal is subdivided into: <lb/>•  2 autonomous regions: the Azores and Madeira, which enjoy a large autonomy guaranteed by the<lb/>Portuguese Constitution, elect their own regional government and legislative assembly and keep tax <lb/>receipts collected in their jurisdiction. In addition, the mainland is subdivided in five regions, which were <lb/>originally created to manage EU structural funds, and whose role has grown to include wider regional <lb/>development issues. Mainland regions have no elected government and are directly administered by central <lb/>government representatives – the so-called Commissions for Regional Coordination and Development <lb/>(CCDR). <lb/>•  308 municipalities – mainly in charge of basic infrastructure and primary education. They are run by an<lb/>executive council and a municipal assembly, both elected for four years. In the past few years, <lb/>municipalities have been encouraged to associate into inter-municipal communities, which have the right to <lb/>collect certain taxes and have a bigger role in the management of EU funds. <lb/>•  4 259 civil parishes (freguesias) – in charge of local current administration and maintenance of certain<lb/>basic infrastructure. The number of parishes per municipalities (14 on average) varies widely, from 1 to 89. <lb/>Parishes are managed by a local assembly and an elected local council, the president of which also sits in <lb/>the municipal assembly. Their economic weight is relatively small, with an overall budget of around <lb/>EUR 450 million (0.3% of GDP). <lb/>Figure 12.

The <lb/>government also agreed to support distressed municipalities with a EUR 1 billion (0.6% of GDP) credit <lb/>line. This will allow municipalities to pay back part of their short-term debt and arrears, the total of which <lb/>for all local and regional authorities reached EUR 4 billion (2.3% of GDP) by the end of 2011. 3 In <lb/>exchange for this support, municipalities have notably committed to cut spending and increase taxes <lb/>(where possible) and fees. The government expects more than half of municipalities to apply for the credit <lb/>line. Applications will be examined by the government in mid-2012. In this context, it is important that the <lb/>conditions under which municipalities receive support, and how much support each municipality is entitled <lb/>to, follow strict and transparent guidelines, as envisaged, to ensure equal treatment of municipalities and <lb/>avoid political interference. <lb/>The central government does not explicitly guarantee local debts and faces a trade-off between <lb/>supporting distressed local authorities and letting them default. On the one hand, financial support to local <lb/>governments could generate significant fiscal costs for the central government at a time of scarce fiscal <lb/>resources. These costs would also risk increasing in the future if the economic outlook (and thus local <lb/>revenues) deteriorates further. Another drawback is moral hazard, as the possibility of financial assistance <lb/>could undermine prudence in future local policymaking, as occurred in Sweden in the 1970s-80s <lb/>(Pettersson-Lidbom and Dahlberg, 2003). On the other hand, a wave of local defaults would impose losses <lb/>on Portuguese banks, thus augmenting already significant recapitalisation needs. In the current context, it <lb/>could also affect investors&apos; confidence in other public borrowers, including the central government itself. <lb/>Overall, this suggests that financial assistance should be provided to distressed local government in cases <lb/>of liquidity problems, i.e. when limited and temporary support would suffice to restore debt sustainability, <lb/>but that the government should be ready to accept defaults of insolvent authorities in some instances, so as <lb/>to reduce moral hazard issues. <lb/>3. <lb/>Combined arrears of local and regional governments reached EUR 2.8 billion by the end of 2011 (European <lb/>Commission, 2012), while their short term debt (less than one year) was EUR 1.3 billion (Bank of Portugal, <lb/>2012). <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>100 <lb/>150 <lb/>200 <lb/>250 <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2. The financial assistance plan to Madeira <lb/>Once Portugal&apos;s poorest region, Madeira has become the country&apos;s second richest over recent decades, thanks <lb/>notably to large subsidies from the central government and the EU. In 2008, regional GDP per capita was 30% higher <lb/>than the national average. Large infrastructure works have helped develop tourism – the island&apos;s main activity (20% of <lb/>regional GDP) – while a low-tax business zone has attracted important off-shore business activities (20% of regional <lb/>GDP). Over the past few years, subsidies have become less abundant as a result of the region&apos;s economic progress. <lb/>However, public spending has not slowed accordingly, leading to the rapid accumulation of debts as large construction <lb/>projects were still undertaken, including a marina and a heliport (both of which are out-of-use because of flawed <lb/>design). <lb/>Unsustainable debt dynamics resulted in Madeira&apos;s regional government looking for financial support. The central <lb/>government agreed in January 2012 to provide EUR 1.5 billion (0.9% of national GDP, 30% of regional GDP) of loans <lb/>to the region, with an interest rate comparable to the central government&apos;s financing costs. The fiscal consolidation <lb/>plan aimed at reducing the regional public deficit from 6% of regional GDP in 2011 (excluding negative one-offs of 11% <lb/>of regional GDP) to 3% of regional GDP in 2012, 1% in 2013 and to balance the budget by 2014. However, the 2011 <lb/>deficit turned out higher than expected by 3½ per cent of regional GDP, putting these objectives at risk. The <lb/>consolidation relies mainly on the revenue side (two thirds of the adjustment).* Income tax and general corporate tax <lb/>rates will be aligned with mainland levels and the value-added tax rate will be raised from 16% to 21%, one percentage <lb/>point below the mainland level. The privileges of the low-tax business zone will be reduced, with a corporate tax rate <lb/>raised from 0% to 4%. On the spending side, measures include a cap on public investment at EUR 150 million per year <lb/>– roughly its underlying level in 2010-11 after correcting for one-offs – and lower public wages, mainly as a result of the <lb/>national level cut in the 13th and 14th month of civil servants&apos; salary. <lb/>Financial assistance is conditional on a strong reinforcement of the fiscal framework. The budget will be subject <lb/>to central government approval before it is voted and its execution will be closely monitored. An audit on arrears, which <lb/>amount to 40% of regional GDP has been carried out in early 2012. However, the size of the region&apos;s total liabilities, <lb/>i.e. including all liabilities of local public companies, is still uncertain. These companies are planned to be restructured <lb/>and partly privatised. No new public-private partnership (PPP) can be contracted until existing PPPs are audited and <lb/>renegotiated. Disbursements of the central government loans will be spread over 2012-15 and conditional to the region <lb/>complying with the programme. Compliance will be assessed through quarterly mission reviews, starting in April 2012. <lb/>Such a strict conditionality is important, as the constitutional autonomy of the region otherwise restricts the central <lb/>government&apos;s ability to influence the region&apos;s policy, as illustrated by its inability in 2011 to stop construction projects <lb/>judged too costly. <lb/>* However, against a no-policy change scenario, the programme contains more measures on the spending side than on the <lb/>revenue side, reflecting that a large planned increase in public investment in 2012 (EUR 400 million, excluding one-offs) was <lb/>cancelled as part of the programme, meaning that public investment will remain broadly stable between 2011 and 2012 <lb/>(excluding one-offs). <lb/>In the case of Madeira, there are significant risks to the programme as the 2011 deficit turned out <lb/>higher than expected and the region&apos;s total liabilities (including arrears and debt from local public <lb/>companies) are still unknown, but may be as high as 150% of regional GDP. In addition, the programme <lb/>assumption that the region will grow at the same pace as the country as a whole appears to be relatively <lb/>fragile, especially given the traditionally high reliance on public demand in the region. The programme&apos;s <lb/>success will depend on the region&apos;s capacity to find new sources of private growth despite the increase in <lb/>taxes and to respect expenditure targets, notably on public investment. This will require a strong <lb/>reinforcement of the regional fiscal framework. The central government should carefully monitor the <lb/>solvency of the region as there is a significant risk that the region may not be able to pay back all of its <lb/>debt, thereby making debt restructuring inevitable. <lb/>Measures are needed to improve the local and regional fiscal framework <lb/>It is also important that financial support to municipalities be accompanied by an enhanced local and <lb/>regional fiscal framework to ensure debt reduction in the medium-term. To this end, the government is <lb/>committed to presenting revised local and regional financing laws by the end of 2012. Important steps in <lb/>this area were already taken in the 2007 reform of the local finance law, which notably requires <lb/></body>

			<body>municipalities to consolidate their accounts with those of local public companies and to submit them to <lb/>external auditing. However, implementation of these measures has been delayed by municipal opposition <lb/>(Blöchliger and Vammalle, 2012). In the current context, implementing them rapidly should be a priority. <lb/>The 2007 reform also introduced limits on municipal total debt (125% of annual revenues) and short-term <lb/>debt (10% of annual revenues). In order to prevent any circumventing of these rules, their scope should be <lb/>broadened to include all liabilities of local authorities, such as payment arrears, debts of local public <lb/>companies and discounted future payments in PPP contracts. Additionally, a balanced budget rule could be <lb/>introduced, a relatively common feature across OECD local governments (Sutherland et al., 2005) that <lb/>would offer the benefit of consistency with the general government&apos;s broader deficit rule. <lb/>The local fiscal framework should also give incentives for local and regional authorities to pay back <lb/>arrears, which had accumulated to almost EUR 2.8 billion (1.6% of GDP) by the end of 2011 and were still <lb/>increasing in the first months of 2012. To this end, the government intends to apply to municipalities the <lb/>budgetary &quot; commitment control &quot; framework which has been put in place at the central level. In this <lb/>framework, entities are not allowed to spend more money than they project to receive and entities with <lb/>spending arrears are forced to adopt more ambitious spending limits. To make the framework fully <lb/>efficient, it will be necessary to prevent municipalities from relying on over-optimistic revenue forecasts, a <lb/>frequent practice in the past. This will require giving the Ministry of Finance a supervisory role in this <lb/>area, while the Fiscal Council could also be involved in monitoring tasks. In addition, municipalities <lb/>should be required to keep their funds in a dedicated account at the Treasury (instead of a private bank <lb/>account), as a way to facilitate monitoring and to reduce general government gross public debt (via more <lb/>debt consolidation). <lb/>The cyclicality of local revenues should be reduced <lb/>Local revenues are particularly cyclical and their abrupt decline in the last few years has been an <lb/>important factor behind the accumulation of local debt. Local revenues include a housing transaction tax <lb/>and a corporate tax, both of which are by nature very sensitive to the economic cycle (Box 3). For <lb/>example, transaction tax revenues have declined by 40% between 2007 and 2009 (Figure 14). Moreover, <lb/>transfers from the central government also decline in economic downturns. This revenue volatility is <lb/>problematic because local governments are generally less well-equipped to cope with revenue swings than <lb/>central governments (Norregaard, 1997). In the eventuality a balanced budget rule for local authorities was <lb/>introduced, reducing this volatility would be even more important as local governments would otherwise <lb/>be forced into a very pro-cyclical spending behaviour. <lb/>Box 3. Municipalities have cyclical resources and little fiscal autonomy <lb/>Municipalities draw roughly half of their resources from local taxes and fees and the other half from transfers from <lb/>the central government and from EU structural funds. The poorest municipalities tend to be more dependent on <lb/>transfers as they have lower tax revenues. Local taxes are mainly housing related, concerning both property (30% of <lb/>local tax revenues) and transactions (20% of local tax revenues). Municipalities set rates for the former, within a <lb/>centrally defined range, but not for the latter. Other tax resources include a local corporate income tax (derrama) and a <lb/>fraction of the vehicle tax. Municipalities&apos; relatively low fiscal autonomy was slightly increased in 2007, by allowing <lb/>them to claim up to 5% of their residents&apos; personal income tax, the principle being that unclaimed receipts remain with <lb/>taxpayers. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Concerning transfers from the central government, municipalities receive a quarter of personal income tax, <lb/>corporate income tax and value-added tax national revenues. These revenues are distributed on the basis of <lb/>demographic, geographic and environmental criteria with an equalisation scheme ensuring strong redistribution <lb/>towards the poorest municipalities. There is no mechanism to smooth these transfers, meaning that a fall in national <lb/>tax revenues is directly translated into falling transfers to municipalities, albeit with a two year lag. Transfers from the <lb/>central government to municipalities also include earmarked funds to finance specific spending on education, health <lb/>and social policy. <lb/></note>

			<body>Figure 14. Local government tax revenue in Portugal <lb/>Million euros <lb/>1. <lb/>Since 1995 this tax is collected by central government but then transferred to local government. <lb/>Source: OECD (2012), &quot; Revenue Statistics: Portugal &quot; , OECD Tax Statistics (database), May. <lb/>Several measures would help to reduce the cyclicality of local revenues. Firstly, housing taxation <lb/>should be shifted from transactions to recurrent taxation of immovable property, as recommended in the <lb/>2010 Survey. Such a measure would make local revenues less volatile but also foster labour mobility, thus <lb/>stimulating potential growth. Secondly, transfers from central to local governments should be set in <lb/>advance on a multi-year basis. This would reduce their volatility and give municipalities more certainty <lb/>about their future resources, which would represent a fair counterpart to stricter monitoring being imposed <lb/>by the central government. Another benefit of this would be that it would limit the scope for higher <lb/>transfers to local governments in election years, as there is evidence that, despite the existing rules, <lb/>electoral motives currently lead to such a bias (Veiga and Veiga, 2011). A third option would be to <lb/>increase local authorities&apos; fiscal autonomy, which is low by international standards, to enable them to cope <lb/>with revenue declines by increasing local taxes. This could also lead to more efficient public service by <lb/>increasing local government&apos;s accountability to taxpayers (Blöchliger and Pinero-Campos, 2011; Joumard <lb/>and Kongsrud, 2003). However, this option should only be considered once local efforts to rationalise <lb/>spending have been completed as the prospect of additional tax resources may undermine these efforts. <lb/>Finally, a common practice is that municipalities levy &quot; compensations &quot; from businesses (e.g. wind turbine <lb/>farms, retailers) establishing in their jurisdiction. This possibility should be reduced to make municipalities <lb/>less dependent on this uncertain revenue source, which is also harmful for the business environment. <lb/>There is large scope to make local spending more efficient <lb/>Enhancing the efficiency of local spending will be crucial to achieving successful consolidation as <lb/>heavy spending cuts are needed to balance local budgets in a context of declining revenues. Empirical <lb/>work suggests that there is large scope for efficiency gains, as high as 40% on the sample of municipalities <lb/>constituted by the Lisbon region (Afonso and Fernandes, 2003). Indeed, municipalities have had few <lb/>incentives for efficiency over the past decade as a result of dynamic revenue growth, cheap credit and a <lb/>weak fiscal framework, notably in terms of local public companies, which has allowed them to pile up <lb/>debts. Excessive fragmentation is also a source of inefficiencies, with certain parishes containing only a <lb/>few hundred people and inter-municipal cooperation still nascent. Rigidities in terms of labour contracts, <lb/>which are required to be similar to central government contracts, may also have limited municipalities&apos; <lb/>flexibility in terms of staffing. However, this feature will now probably help reduce local spending as the <lb/>central government is implementing large cuts in public wages. Finally, local governments have a tendency <lb/>to invest excessively in infrastructure, despite basic needs in this area being already largely satisfied <lb/>(da Silva, 2008, Pina and Abreu, 2012), which suggests that in the eventuality a local balanced budget rule <lb/>is introduced, it should include capital expenditures. <lb/>0 <lb/>200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1200 <lb/>0 <lb/>200 <lb/>400 <lb/>600 <lb/>800 <lb/>1000 <lb/>1200 <lb/>1990 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 <lb/>Corporate income <lb/>Personal income <lb/>Property (IMI) <lb/>Housing transactions¹ (IMT) <lb/>Other <lb/></body>

			<body>To improve spending efficiency, the authorities are committed to presenting new laws, before the end <lb/>of 2012, concerning both municipalities and autonomous regions. Measures will include an assessment and <lb/>a restructuring of local public companies, a 30% cut in the number of parishes (with a stronger focus on <lb/>urban areas) and a facilitation of inter-municipal cooperation (Portuguese Government, 2011). These <lb/>welcome measures should be complemented by the generalisation of benchmarking and performance <lb/>indicators, which can be powerful tools to foster local spending efficiency (Mizell, 2006; OECD, 2009d) as <lb/>illustrated e.g. by the success of the &quot; Kostra &quot; system in Norway (OECD, 2008b, Box 3.11). In this area, <lb/>first efforts could concentrate on the domains of water, wastewater and waste management, where <lb/>indicators would facilitate efforts to streamline the local public corporate sector, while also bringing <lb/>environmental benefits (OECD 2011b). In addition, a purchasing cooperative could be created to take <lb/>advantage of economies of scale when purchasing supplies. <lb/>Making better use of EU structural funds would mitigate fiscal consolidation <lb/>EU structural and cohesion funds are a significant resource for the Portuguese economy, amounting to <lb/>around 2% of GDP per year (Box 4). Spending them efficiently is now all the more important that they are <lb/>one of the few remaining sources of financing for the economy in the current context of deleveraging and <lb/>fiscal consolidation. The first challenge is to ensure that all available funds are spent despite the serious <lb/>financing constraints faced by national partners, which have notably led to the cancellation of large <lb/>infrastructure projects (new Lisbon airport, high-speed Lisbon-Madrid train). The second and most <lb/>important challenge is to put funds to their most productive use. This notably implies reinforcing <lb/>governance to prevent efforts to absorb funds from undermining careful project selection and to reduce <lb/>scope for political interference as there is empirical evidence of electoral motivations influencing funds&apos; <lb/>allocation to municipalities (Veiga, 2010). <lb/>In terms of the absorption of EU funds, Portugal is doing better than in the preceding cycle <lb/>(Marzinetto, 2011) and than most other big recipients of funds (Figure 15). By the end of 2011, 80% of the <lb/>funds allocated for 2007-13 – which have to be spent no later than 2015 – had already been committed to <lb/>selected projects, 40% had been effectively spent and 30% had already been reimbursed by the European <lb/>Commission (Portuguese Government, 2012). To stimulate absorption, the Portuguese authorities are <lb/>progressively shifting money from transport and environment infrastructure programmes, where many <lb/>projects have been cancelled, to other programmes, notably related to education. To this end, an <lb/>assessment of inactive projects was carried out in April 2012, aiming to free up to EUR 1.5 billion of funds <lb/>for reallocation. The absorption of funds will also be increased by the EU decision in December 2011 to <lb/>reduce local co-financing rates in crisis countries, which, for Portugal, could bring it from an average 30% <lb/>down to 15%. This lower co-financing will apply for 2010-13, but only retroactively, i.e. on projects <lb/>already selected, to avoid attracting lower quality projects. <lb/>In this context, available EU funds should be strategically shifted towards two of Portugal&apos;s most <lb/>pressing economic priorities: alleviating the credit squeeze on small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) <lb/>and avoiding high unemployment becoming structural. Regarding the former, additional resources should <lb/>be devolved to provide financing or guarantees to viable SMEs, which may require further approval by the <lb/>European Commission to reallocate funds across programmes. In addition, measures should be taken to <lb/>facilitate SMEs&apos; participation in EU funded projects, e.g. by clarifying tender processes, providing SMEs <lb/>with support to comply with (cumbersome) administrative procedures and giving SMEs more say about the <lb/>strategic allocation of funds. To tackle the unemployment problem better, funds should be further shifted <lb/>towards active labour market policies such as targeted training programmes for (especially young) <lb/>unemployed, a move also encouraged by the European authorities (European Council, 2012). <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 4. EU structural and cohesion funds in Portugal <lb/>Portugal is the biggest recipient of EU structural and cohesion funds among &quot; old &quot; EU member States, with an <lb/>allocation of 1.8% of GDP per year for 2007-13 (Figure 15). Funds allocated to Portugal are split roughly evenly <lb/>between three priorities: &quot; territorial enhancement &quot; (mainly infrastructure investment), &quot; competitiveness &quot; (support to <lb/>companies and innovation) and &quot; human potential &quot; (education and training, including school infrastructures). When <lb/>compared with past programmes and other countries, this implies more focus on education and less on infrastructure, <lb/>reflecting that Portuguese basic infrastructure needs are now broadly satisfied while the lack of education remains an <lb/>important bottleneck to growth. <lb/>Figure 15. Absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds by end 2011 <lb/>Funds allocated over 2007-13 <lb/>1. <lb/>Average for the period 2007-13, Eurostat projections. <lb/>Source: QREN (2012), &quot; Indicadores Conjunturais de Monitorização &quot; , Boletim Informativo 14, Comissão Técnica de Coordenação do <lb/>Qren and Eurostat (2012), &quot; Economy and Finance &quot; , Eurostat Database, May. <lb/>The selection of projects financed by EU funds is carried out by national and regional authorities within a <lb/>framework of operational programmes reflecting the three national priorities. Each programme can receive financing <lb/>from one or several of the three EU funds: the European Regional Development Fund for activities such as <lb/>infrastructure investment and support to small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Social Fund mostly for <lb/>education, and the Cohesion Fund for transport and environment related activities. In Portugal, private projects are <lb/>chosen by selection committees after public calls for projects, while public projects are either directly integrated into <lb/>public policy programmes (e.g. school building programmes) or selected by national authorities in accordance with <lb/>publicly disclosed guidelines agreed upon with local stakeholders. Large infrastructure projects (exceeding <lb/>EUR 50 million) also require ex ante cost-benefit analyses and explicit approval by the European Commission. <lb/>Monitoring is mainly a national responsibility, with the European Commission only in charge of monitoring national <lb/>governance frameworks and dedicating relatively low means to combat fraud.* <lb/>* Financial Times (2010), &quot; Net That Fails to Catch EUR 700m Errors &quot; , In depth Report on EU Structural Funds, 30 November. <lb/>In addition, further efforts are needed to improve governance, especially in a context of lower <lb/>co-financing rates. At the macro level, a ministerial coordination committee, chaired by the Finance <lb/>Minister, has recently been created. It may help address the need for high-level arbitration in the strategic <lb/>allocation of funds both across sectors and across regions (Barca et al., 2012). A strategic monitoring <lb/>process is also being introduced to assess the efficiency of policies and reorient funds if needed. This is <lb/>welcome as continuous evaluation and benchmarking are essential to make an efficient use of funds <lb/>(OECD, 2009d). Such evaluation should be generalised, carried out by an independent body and its results <lb/>should be published. At a more micro level, there is also scope to rationalise the allocation of funds by <lb/>generalising ex ante economic analyses and by delegating the selection of public projects to more <lb/>independent and more accountable agencies in order to reduce political interference. In addition, more <lb/>means should be dedicated to combat fraud as &quot; soft &quot; investment projects such as training programmes tend <lb/>to be more difficult to monitor than infrastructure projects.

If risks materialise significantly and growth is <lb/>far lower than projected in the programme, the automatic stabilisers could be allowed to operate at least <lb/>partially. <lb/>•  Introduce an explicit and easily enforceable public expenditure rule consistent with revenue projections and<lb/>medium-term fiscal objectives and in line with the European fiscal framework. <lb/>•  The Fiscal Council should prioritise core functions, including assessing the macroeconomic and fiscal<lb/>projections, compliance with fiscal rules and giving fiscal policy recommendations to the government. Fiscal <lb/>council board members should be allowed to have other paid employment. <lb/>•  The Minister of Finance should be required to provide a formal response to fiscal council reports to embed<lb/>the fiscal council&apos;s role in the policy debate. <lb/>State-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships <lb/>•  To improve transparency around state-owned enterprises (SOE), explicitly set and show in the<lb/>government&apos;s accounts the subsidy paid to urban transport companies in return for an agreed level of <lb/>services and at least operational balance. <lb/>•  Continue to rationalise the rail network and services replacing less frequented lines with bus services to<lb/>improve SOE performance. <lb/>•  Future public-private partnerships (PPP) should be budgeted for in the same way as other investment to<lb/>avoid PPPs being used as a way to push expenditure into the future. <lb/>Local government and EU structural funds <lb/>•  As envisaged, support to local and regional governments should come only under strict and transparent<lb/>guidelines and be accompanied by improvements in the fiscal framework. Municipalities should notably be <lb/>required to keep their funds in a dedicated account at the Treasury. <lb/>•  Local government revenues should be made less volatile by shifting from taxing housing transactions to<lb/>higher recurrent taxation of immovable property and by setting government transfers on a multi-year basis. <lb/>•  Local spending efficiency should be encouraged by the generalisation of benchmarking and performance<lb/>indicators. <lb/>•  Absorption of EU structural funds should be further stimulated by shifting available funds towards credit to<lb/>SMEs and targeted training programmes, while governance should be reinforced to enhance efficiency. <lb/></body>

			<body>Annex A2 <lb/>THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PROGRAMMES OF PORTUGAL AND ACTUAL FISCAL <lb/>DEVELOPMENTS <lb/>To further understand the factors behind fiscal policy underperformance, Stability and Growth <lb/>Programmes (SGPs) from 2000 to 2010 are analysed using the approach in Beynet and Leibfritz (2009) 4 . <lb/>The difference between the forecasted and actual fiscal balance is divided into the gaps between actual and <lb/>forecasted revenue-to-GDP ratio expenditure-to-GDP ratios. The gap between the actual and forecasted <lb/>revenue ratio is influenced by changes in tax elasticity and by new fiscal measures, although the precise <lb/>break-down is not computed due to a lack of data. The difference between the actual and forecasted <lb/>expenditure ratio is further divided into the gap that arises due to the difference in the actual and projected <lb/>nominal GDP growth and the gap attributable to differences between actual and projected nominal <lb/>expenditure. The results are presented by grouping programmes at different forecasting horizons. The main <lb/>findings (table) are that: <lb/>• As the forecasting horizon extends, over-optimistic nominal GDP forecasts become an <lb/>increasingly important and dominant cause of larger than expected deficits.<lb/>• In the programme reference year (for example 2010 for the 2010 programme) greater than <lb/>expected nominal expenditure (expenditure slippage against budgeted nominal amounts) is the <lb/>main reason for larger than projected fiscal deficits. It also plays an important role at longer time <lb/>horizons.<lb/>• The revenue ratio tends to be higher than forecast, partly due to new measures, such as VAT rate <lb/>increases, taken in response to the worse than expected fiscal situation. A notable exception is <lb/>2009, where a break-down in the usual tax elasticities help explain the particularly large <lb/>deterioration in the balance in that year (OECD, 2010) 5 .<lb/>Table A2.1.
