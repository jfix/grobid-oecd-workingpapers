			<p>through seminars and debates which promote an understanding of Better Regulation<lb/> issues.<lb/> 2. The development of a Better Regulation policy and the improvement of regulatory<lb/> management capacities is an issue which is competing with a significant number of<lb/> other issues, all of pressing importance. NMS need time to absorb the changes they<lb/> have experienced as a result of their application for EU membership, in particular the<lb/> incorporation of the acquis communautaire and for many of them the switch to an open<lb/> market economy. The responsibility for the development of Better Regulation in the<lb/> NMS falls on the shoulders of a dedicated but small number of officials. The challenge<lb/> for the NMS is to recognize that this is not just as a &apos;one shot&apos; policy but is something<lb/> which requires sustained commitment to improvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. There is a widespread understanding in all NMS of the necessity to use Better<lb/> Regulation tools. However, many NMS enacted laws to oblige officials to prepare<lb/> impact assessments for all new legislation. These laws were rarely underpinned by<lb/> adequate methodologies or institutional arrangements to oversee the quality of<lb/> assessments. As a result, the potential benefits from the use of this tool were lost.<lb/> 4. Most NMS are addressing this problem but the approach to impact assessment is an<lb/> example of a wider problem, namely, the belief that the enactment of a law is a sufficient<lb/> activity for the solution of a policy problem. As well as enacting laws, NMS need to<lb/> address the necessity to support new laws with adequate institutional arrangements to<lb/> ensure that they are enforced or complied with.<lb/> 5. All NMS recognise the need to measure the size of administrative costs and, where<lb/> possible, take steps to reduce them. Progress may be seen across the NMS in both<lb/> measuring the costs and reviewing administrative procedures, frequency of inspections<lb/> and related official activities to ensure the burden on people, and small businesses in<lb/> particular, is kept to a minimum. This is a very positive development which should be<lb/> encouraged and supported, where possible, by the Institutions of the EU.<lb/> 6. In addition, the executive and legislative branches of government need to work together<lb/> and follow common policies to achieve Better Regulation. Many of the NMS have<lb/> experienced recent political turmoil. Participants in all parts of the political process need<lb/> to develop a deeper understand that priority should be given to a good regulatory<lb/> environment to safeguard and encourage the competitiveness of their economies. In the<lb/> review of the quality of regulations both branches of government need to adopt a more<lb/> multidisciplinary approach where regulations are reviewed against the application of<lb/> Better Regulation principles as well as legal effectiveness issues.<lb/> 7. In all NMS, there is a need to review enforcement and compliance policies to discover if<lb/> there are better ways of ensuring that, once laws, are enacted they are enforced or<lb/> complied with in a manner that achieves the result intended. This is also an issue that<lb/> may be usefully addressed at the level of the Institutions of the EU and offers a rich field<lb/> for future cooperation.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.<lb/> INTRODUCTION<lb/> This Report is a synthesis of assessments of the regulatory management capacities of the 10<lb/> New Member States that joined the EU on the 1 st May 2004 (the NMS).<lb/> This section sets out the background to the report, describes the methodology used and explains<lb/> what the report covers and what it excludes.<lb/> It provides a brief overview of the NMS and explains the subject matter of the report.<lb/> Background to Report<lb/></head>

			<p>Enhancing the competitiveness of its economy through increased productivity growth is one of<lb/> the main challenges recognised by the European Union in the original Lisbon strategy and the<lb/> renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs (2000 and 2005). The improvement of the<lb/> regulatory environment and regulatory processes at the level of the Institutions of the EU and its<lb/> Member States through developing a Better Regulation policy is a key factor in creating a<lb/> business environment conducive to productivity growth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Regulation plays a central role in the functioning of economies and is essential in addressing<lb/> market failures, fostering competition, promoting safety, health and welfare and facilitating the<lb/> protection of the environment. High quality regulation achieves these objectives. Low quality<lb/> regulation may have the opposite effect. The European Commission has developed a Better<lb/> Regulation policy designed to improve its regulatory management capacities. The policy<lb/> functions at the level of all institutions to improve the flow of new regulations and the existing<lb/> stock of regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>OECD Reports on Regulatory Reform<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD has published a series of Reports on Regulatory Reform for most OECD countries.<lb/> These Reports include a chapter on the capacity of these countries to produce high quality<lb/> regulations. From these studies, some understanding may be gleaned about the regulatory<lb/> management capacities of certain EU Member States. However, no such studies existed for the<lb/> NMS, except the OECD reports on regulatory reform in the</p>

			<head>Czech Republic, Hungary and<lb/> Poland.<lb/></head>

			<p>The European Commission wanted to get a better understanding of the regulatory management<lb/> capacities of the NMS and to promote the adoption of a Better Regulation policy in all Member<lb/> States, similar to those adopted by the Institutions of the EU. With this objective, the European<lb/> Commission requested Sigma to assess the regulatory management capacities of the NMS. A<lb/> report setting out the assessment for each NMS was prepared and given to each NMS and the<lb/> European Commission.<lb/></p>

			<p>The individual NMS reports were not published by the European Commission as they are<lb/> documents internal to them and to the governments concerned. However, the NMS were free to<lb/> translate and publish the reports or to adapt the material in them for their own policy needs. The<lb/> reports for the</p>

			<figure>Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia were<lb/> translated and made available in these NMS.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Issues Examined<lb/></head>

			<p>The assessments were undertaken by reference to a baseline, set out in Annex 2, created for<lb/> the purpose of the 10 assessments. The assessments sought to examine 5 areas:<lb/> 1. The existence of a policy as regards regulatory management and the extent to which it<lb/> has developed into a policy to improve regulation (Better Regulation).<lb/> 2. The formulation of policy, drafting of regulations1, the process for assuring regulatory<lb/> quality for both &apos;flow&apos; of new regulations and &apos;stock&apos; of existing regulations.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. The enactment process.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Enforcement and compliance mechanisms.<lb/></head>

			<p>The baseline was drawn up specifically for this project and does not appear in any other literature<lb/> on the subject.<lb/></p>

			<head>Issues not Examined<lb/></head>

			<p>The assessments of the regulatory management capacities of the NMS, upon which this<lb/> synthesis is based, did not seek to judge whether regulations made in the Member States<lb/> concerned were well or badly made or whether legislation in NMS is of high quality. Nor did the<lb/> process seek to judge whether Member States were overregulated or not. The assessments<lb/> were concerned with identifying the extent to which the regulatory management capacities of<lb/> NMS measured up against a baseline designed for this study and to what extent Better regulation<lb/> type policies were developing in those countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>The assessments made recommendations for reforms to each NMS, most of which were<lb/> accepted as being in line with their own actual or planned policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methodology<lb/></head>

			<p>The preparation of the report on the NMS followed three phases: set up, peer review and fact<lb/> checking. The set up phase included the development of a benchmark or baseline against which<lb/> the regulatory management capacities of the NMS would be studied. A questionnaire (</p>

			<table>Annex 3)<lb/> was also drawn up and submitted to each NMS.<lb/> Each New Member State was visited by a peer team for five consecutive working days. A panel<lb/> of peers was selected for the process (Annex 4). The peers were selected on the basis of their<lb/> knowledge, experience and standing in relation to Better Regulation issues and were drawn from<lb/> the Directors of Better Regulation Network 2 and the OECD Working Party on regulatory<lb/> management.<lb/></table>

			<p>Three peers were selected for each mission to a NMS. The particular peers selected for each<lb/> mission were chosen to provide a mix of skills, knowledge and experience in relevant fields:<lb/> administration, legal systems and economic policy issues. They were also selected to achieve a<lb/> geographic spread and a balanced representation of different administrative and legal systems. A<lb/> 1<lb/></p>

			<p>The word &apos;regulation&apos; is used throughout the text to mean legal or administrative instruments to achieve policy objectives. The<lb/> term &apos;regulation&apos; is in more common usage by economists and political scientists in the wide sense of achieving policy<lb/> outcomes. Lawyers use the word &apos;regulation&apos; to refer to secondary legislation. The study reflects much of the thinking that has<lb/> taken place in the OECD on this subject and reports written in this field use the word &apos;regulation&apos; more frequently than<lb/> &apos;legislation&apos;. Hence, the word &apos;regulation&apos; is used as often as possible. However, from time to time, this report for clarity uses<lb/> &apos;legislation&apos; and this is the term most familiar to officials with legal qualifications. &apos;Legislation&apos; is further classified into primary<lb/> laws (made by parliaments) and secondary laws (made under the authority of primary legislation).<lb/> report was drafted in respect of each NMS, agreed between the peers, and submitted to the NMS<lb/> for fact checking.<lb/></p>

			<head>Process<lb/></head>

			<p>The peer review process used was designed to develop a policy dialogue within the NMS and<lb/> between the NMS and the peers as well as to examine and to identify potential strengths,<lb/> weaknesses or gaps in the institutional, policy and policy tools framework for regulatory<lb/> management. This process resulted in a lively exchange of views in most NMS and a spirit of<lb/> exchanged successes and failures. Given the importance of Better Regulation to the Lisbon<lb/> Agenda, the assessment of each NMS sought evidence of regulatory management capacities<lb/> generally and, particularly, the capacity to adopt, implement and develop a Better Regulation<lb/> policy. The exercise was also designed to highlight policies that have worked well in NMS and,<lb/> through the peers, to provide information to NMS as well as to identify areas where<lb/> improvements could be brought about.<lb/></p>

			<p>Related to this process, seminars were organised in six NMS, 3 which enabled experts to be<lb/> brought from other Member States and enabled a wide number of officials to hear about Better<lb/> Regulation and the review process. In addition, the Ministry for the Economy in Poland<lb/> organised a successful and well attended conference on Better Regulation in the NMS.<lb/></p>

			<head>NMS — Overview<lb/></head>

			<p>The NMS share many matters in common as regards regulatory management policy. All have<lb/> engaged in one way or another with the development of policies that are similar in objectives to<lb/> those adopted by the Institutions of the European Union, and other countries as part of a world<lb/> wide trend towards a Better Regulation agenda. Much progress has been made and many<lb/> developments have taken place between the initiation of the project and its completion. The<lb/> following Table gives a flavour of what has happened and is intended to be illustrative of<lb/> progress rather than a comprehensive overview, which would require regular updating.<lb/></p>

			<head>Some Examples of Best Practice and Proposed Developments<lb/></head>

			<p>The first &apos;One-Stop-Shop&apos; for citizens was opened<lb/> in December 2005 so as to deliver better access<lb/> to certain categories of government information<lb/> and a range of services It brings together the<lb/> following services: identity documents, car<lb/> registration, health and social benefits. It is an<lb/> additional facility provided for the convenience of<lb/> the public and services continue to be offered in<lb/> the specific offices of each ministry. The<lb/> One-Stop-Shop is staffed with seconded staff<lb/> from the various relevant ministries. It is intended<lb/> as a showpiece of the government&apos;s policy to<lb/> make administration more accessible to the<lb/> public.<lb/> Cyprus has appointed a<lb/> Working Party to investigate<lb/> the means by which impact<lb/> assessment may be<lb/> incorporated into the<lb/> policy-making process. A<lb/> second &apos;One Stop Shop&apos;<lb/> was opened in October<lb/> 2006 and a third is planned<lb/> to be opened by</p>

			<figure>Hungary<lb/> (Fact check<lb/> 15 August 2006)<lb/></figure>

			<p>In 2004, two initiatives to provide training for<lb/> officials in modern administration, including Better<lb/> Regulation, were introduced. The first is in<lb/> Budapest; the second in Perch University, which<lb/> started a Better Regulation curriculum for local<lb/> authority lawyers. Training aims to give officials<lb/> the capacity to undertake and manage an impact<lb/> assessment project.<lb/></p>

			<p>A distinctive feature of the Latvian system of<lb/> governance is that a representative of NGOs and<lb/> professional associations may attend the State<lb/> Secretaries&apos; meetings as an observer. This<lb/> feature ensures that civil society can be made<lb/> aware, through a network of NGOs and<lb/> professional associations, of developments in<lb/> policy and proposals for new regulations. The<lb/> process is structured so that NGOs and<lb/> professional associations may submit comments<lb/> on draft policies and draft regulations.<lb/> It is planned to develop a<lb/> standard cost model and an<lb/> ad hoc simplification<lb/> programme is underway.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is an inter-ministerial working group (the<lb/> Task Force for Modern Economic Regulation) to<lb/> develop Better Regulation policy; a team in the<lb/> Ministry for the Economy and an official in each<lb/> Ministry is responsible for the development of<lb/> Better Regulation in that Ministry.<lb/> As of 2006, an explicit<lb/> Better Regulation strategy is<lb/> being developed in Poland.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">On 19 August 2006</ref>, the<lb/> Council of Ministers adopted<lb/> the Regulatory Reform<lb/> Programme.

			<p>There is a Programme of Measures for Reduction<lb/> of Administrative Burdens which aims to reduce<lb/> administrative barriers, ensure that public<lb/> administration is friendly, effective, open and<lb/> transparent, and provide impetus for the rapid<lb/> development of e-government. All ministries are<lb/> preparing work plans for the 2007-2008 period to<lb/> reduce administrative burdens.<lb/> The establishment in 2006<lb/> of a special group to<lb/> oversee Better Regulation<lb/> was a significant move<lb/> towards the development of<lb/> a comprehensive Better<lb/> Regulation policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Period of Rapid Change<lb/></head>

			<p>The NMS formerly under communist influence have undergone a period of rapid and substantial<lb/> change in their adaptation from &apos;command and control&apos; economies to free market and have<lb/> undertaken the changes necessary to adopt the acquis communautaire.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a relatively short period of time, those NMS had to build new institutional capacities or develop<lb/> and adapt old ones. Cyprus and Malta did not have to address the issues associated with<lb/> developing a free market but had to address the challenge of adopting a substantial volume of<lb/> new legislation so as to comply with the acquis communautaire, without the benefit of the kind of<lb/> aid and assistance made available to the other NMS.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cyprus and Malta</head>

			<p>had the advantage of legal systems and institutional structures which had<lb/> developed over a long period of time. This advantage had to be weighed against the fact that<lb/> they were small NMS with an administrative capacity already stretched to cover domestic needs.<lb/> All NMS faced an acceleration of history. An assessment of the full impact of this acceleration will<lb/> be needed later, in the light of whether it succeeds or fails and why. At the time the assessments<lb/> were undertaken, all NMS were breathing a sigh of relief that the challenge of adoption of the<lb/> acquis communautaire had been met.<lb/></p>

			<p>The peer teams shared the experience of, on the one hand, seeing a rich harvest of<lb/> administrative, economic, political and social change and, on the other hand, seeing fields that<lb/> had just been seeded needing time for the seeds to sprout and grow.<lb/> A new generation of officials has emerged in these countries and it is fortunate that the challenge<lb/> of improving regulatory management is being taken up by that generation.<lb/></p>

			<head>General Challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>Five broad challenges face all NMS: the need to sustain political support; the need to undertake<lb/> impact assessment in substance as well as in form; efficiency, as well as legal effectiveness is a<lb/> key determinant of good quality regulation; parliaments need to pay attention also to Better<lb/> Regulation issues and enforcement policy needs more consideration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Political Support Needs to be Sustained<lb/></head>

			<p>Political support for Better Regulation is present in all the NMS studied. However, further support<lb/> and encouragement will be needed to sustain progress. Political support for the introduction of<lb/> policies on Better Regulation is more visible than tangible political support for its implementation.<lb/> Some NMS (Czech Republic and Poland) had adopted explicit policies on Better Regulation<lb/> before the peer review process.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, and</ref> Slovenia were in the process of adopting such a policy and the<lb/> other states were either considering the adoption of an explicit policy or believed that what they<lb/> were doing was sufficient to provide high quality regulation.<lb/> However, experience from OECD countries suggests that the development of Better Regulation<lb/> is not a &apos;one shot&apos; policy but is one which needs continuing monitoring and usually needs to go<lb/> through a number of iterations to make it successful. Even in NMS where there is a policy in<lb/> place, it will require continuous effort to maintain it.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact Assessments Need to be Undertaken in Substance as well as in Form<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS, except Malta and Cyprus, have laws requiring the undertaking of regulatory impact<lb/> assessment (RIA) as part of new regulatory policy development.<lb/> However, inadequate institutional arrangements, particularly as regards the quality review of<lb/> assessments, lack of clear methodologies and training meant that the process became an empty<lb/> formula and RIA existed in name and not in substance.<lb/></p>

			<p>These problems are being, or have been, addressed (<ref type="biblio">Estonia, Czech Republic, Latvia,<lb/> Lithuania, Poland</ref>, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia). In these countries progress is being<lb/> made to improve institutional support for RIA, to develop effective methodologies and train<lb/> officials.<lb/></p>

			<head>Efficiency, as well as Legal Effectiveness, is a Key Determinant of Good Quality<lb/> Regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy formulation and regulation drafting process in all NMS is inevitably influenced by<lb/> cultural, legal and administrative traditions and practices. There is no doubt that legal certainty is<lb/> an essential part of regulatory effectiveness. However, experience from OECD studies suggests<lb/> that not only do regulations have to be legally effective but they must also be efficient.<lb/> Regulations need to be complied with easily or enforced and they must operate without<lb/> unintended consequences. To achieve these ends, a purely legalistic approach to regulation<lb/> making is not enough. There must be a multidisciplinary approach to the formulation of policy and<lb/> the drafting of legislation and recognition of the need to put appropriate structures in place.<lb/></p>

			<p>The administrative structures in all NMS focus on legal effectiveness. Many laws are enacted in<lb/> the NMS without sufficient attention being paid to how they will work in practice and how they will<lb/> be applied. Progress is being made in this area but it is uneven and may not be sustained.<lb/></p>

			<head>Parliaments Need to Pay Attention also to Better Regulation Issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Effective regulatory regimes need effective parliamentary supervision. Many Parliaments in the<lb/> NMS have developed good research capacities but have not yet engaged fully with the potential<lb/> improvements to regulatory quality that can be brought about by the use of Better Regulation<lb/> policies. In most NMS there is some evidence being shown by officials in the executive branch of<lb/> government in improving regulatory management capacity through Better Regulation. However,<lb/> this interest is not being matched in the NMS by the legislative branch of governments.<lb/> Suggestions made in particular Sigma reports given to the NMS included the idea that there<lb/> should be an annual debate in parliaments on Better Regulation issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enforcement Policy Needs More Consideration<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS claim to have a &apos;zero tolerance&apos; approach to enforcement, but capacity challenges limit<lb/> this approach. Given the importance of this issue to European integration, more attention needs<lb/> to be paid by NMS to developing a more realistic approach to enforcement, such as the<lb/> development of a risk-based policy or a policy that imposes fees for inspections.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> ORIGINS OF EUROPEAN UNION POLICY ON BETTER REGULATION<lb/> What are the Origins of Better Regulation?<lb/></head>

			<p>Better Regulation derives from a concern by governments to keep the cost of government to a<lb/> minimum and to ensure that regulation is efficient as well as legally effective. It derives also from<lb/> a concern that regulatory costs should not exceed benefits conferred by legislation. The roots of<lb/> Better Regulation can be traced to regulatory reforms in the United States, which were aimed at<lb/> reducing the size of government and the interference by government in the market.<lb/></p>

			<p>A range of regulatory reforms and deregulation activity first in the United States of America and<lb/> then in other countries led to better functioning markets, according to OECD reports. However,<lb/> regulatory reform and deregulation led, in many cases, to an increase in regulation. This was<lb/> because when state-run monopolies existed there was no need for rules on market entry and<lb/> exit. However, when the state moved out of areas such as telecommunications and other utilities,<lb/> rules had to be introduced to ensure equity in markets and the number of regulations increased.<lb/> In the United States, concerns about too much regulation and bad regulation were met with<lb/> policies to improve the quality of legislation, including the use of impact assessment.<lb/></p>

			<head>In the United Kingdom, a White Paper in 1985 Lifting the Burden</head>

Other European countries developed similar policies.<lb/> The Institutions of the European Union began to develop a Better Regulation policy in the same<lb/> period. Similar developments took place in other Member States of the EU, notably, the<lb/> Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. Some countries, such as France, undertook similar<lb/> reforms in the context of modernisation of their public services. Ireland adopted a policy entitled<lb/> Regulating Better.<lb/></table>

			<head>OECD and Regulatory Reform<lb/></head>

			<p>The OECD has studied over 23 countries from the point of view of regulatory reform and<lb/> observed that countries that performed better economically paid attention to the quality of the<lb/> management of their regulatory processes. In the OECD studies, three stages of reform are<lb/> visible. In the first phase, classified as Deregulation, what takes place is the elimination of<lb/> regulations that impede competition and trade, and the reduction of a number of regulations. The<lb/> process also includes the reduction of the burden on business and cost of regulations as well as<lb/> the simplification of procedures and the streamlining of the administration. All of the countries<lb/> studied fall into this category though the degree to which all reforms have been completed vary in<lb/> degree between and within those countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the second phase of the development of this subject, classified as Regulatory Reform, there is<lb/> an effort made to produce high quality regulations by improved policy-making processes which<lb/> make use of tools such as impact assessment, better consultation and more effective planning of<lb/> regulatory arrangements. This stage may also involve the updating and review and<lb/> modernisation (i.e., coherence with political objectives in the areas of economy, environment and<lb/> social standards) of existing regulations. All of the countries studied fall into this category though<lb/> the degree to which all reforms have been completed vary in degree between and within those<lb/> countries<lb/> Finally, the third phase of reform is classified by the OECD as regulatory management, which is<lb/></p>

			<table>concerned with long-term, systematic perspectives concerned with improved institutions and<lb/> regulatory performance. None of the countries have reached this phase fully.<lb/> A key development in thinking, contributed by the OECD, was the adoption in 1995 of the<lb/> Recommendation of the Council of the OECD on Improving the Quality of Government<lb/> Regulation 7 . This recommendation set out the first internationally accepted set of principles on<lb/> ensuring regulatory quality. It included the 10 point OECD Reference Check List for Regulatory<lb/> Decision Making. In a seminal report From Interventionism to Regulatory Governance 8</table>

			<p>, the<lb/> OECD identified three key drivers for regulatory effectiveness. These were regulatory policies<lb/> (i.e., policies to improve the regulatory process), regulatory tools and regulatory institutions. The<lb/> OECD Regulatory Reform Programme, which has involved a series of studies of regulatory<lb/> reforms in OECD member countries, is aimed at helping governments improve regulatory quality.<lb/> Its focus concentrated on reforming regulations that raise unnecessary obstacles to competition,<lb/> innovation and growth, while ensuring that regulations efficiently serve important social goals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy on Better Regulation (European Union)<lb/></head>

			<p>An initial step towards improving the regulatory environment in the Institutions of the EU was<lb/> taken when the European Union Institutions adopted the drafting guidance recommendations<lb/> contained in the Inter-Institutional Agreement of December 1998. The purpose of this was to<lb/> improve the quality of draft legislation 9 . The Edinburgh European Council of 1992 made the task<lb/> of simplifying and improving the regulatory environment one the Community&apos;s main priorities.<lb/> However, it was not until the mid-nineties that the search for better quality regulation became<lb/> systematic. Better Regulation is also referred to in a protocol attached to the Treaty of<lb/> Amsterdam.<lb/></p>

			<p>The issue was further addressed in the context of efforts to counter the relatively poor economic<lb/> growth performance of many Member States – an issue of recurring concern to European policy<lb/> makers. To address the concern, the Heads of State and Governments of the European Union<lb/> met in Lisbon in 2000 and launched a series of ambitious reforms at national and European level<lb/> as part of an overall strategy. By establishing an effective internal market, by boosting research<lb/> and innovation and by improving education, to name only a few reform efforts, they aimed to<lb/> address the challenges posed to the European Union by the impact of demographic change and<lb/> globalisation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The development of Better Regulation in the European Union accelerated further with the EU<lb/> White Paper on Governance. The White Paper suggests that there are links between good<lb/> governance and the drive for Better Regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Mandelkern Group Report<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the practical measures taken to deliver this policy was the establishment of a group,<lb/> representative of Member States, under the Chairmanship of a judge of the</p>

			<table>Council of State in<lb/> France, Mr. D. Mandelkern 10 , to examine ways in which policy-making and regulation drafting<lb/> could be improved in the Institutions of the EU. The group reported in November 2001 and<lb/> produced a blueprint for Better Regulation in the European Union. The report was met with<lb/> universal acclaim and its recommendations were largely adopted by the EU Institutions.<lb/> 7<lb/> OECD/GD/ 95(95) OECD, Paris (1995).<lb/> 8<lb/> OECD Paris, [PUMA(2002)3].<lb/> 9<lb/> Declaration 39 on the quality of the drafting of Community legislation, annexed to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty,<lb/> 1997.<lb/> The Group drew from many sources, including reports on regulatory reform in almost 20 OECD<lb/> countries 11 . The conclusions of the Group were, essentially, that to achieve Better Regulation,<lb/> there is a need for high level and cross-government political support, the allocation of appropriate<lb/> resources and an explicit Better Regulation policy. That policy should use tools such as: impact<lb/> assessment, simplification, and consultation; it should promote a change in culture in the<lb/> formulation of policy and the drafting of regulations.<lb/></table>

			<p>The report argued that Better Regulation is a drive to improve the policy-making process through<lb/> the integrated use of effective tools and not an attempt to impose additional bureaucratic<lb/> burdens. The report proposed an Action Plan, which was closely followed by the EU Institutions,<lb/> and set out 7 core principles for Better Regulation. These principles are: necessity,<lb/> proportionality, subsidiarity, transparency, accountability, accessibility and simplicity.<lb/> The Mandelkern Group report was followed by the European Commission with a Communication<lb/> in 2002, introducing a new integrated impact assessment system, roadmaps, instruments which<lb/> provide an alternative approach to legislation (e.g., co-regulation, self-regulation), minimum<lb/> standards for consultation of interested parties and guidelines for gathering and using expert<lb/> advice 12 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Renewal of the Lisbon Process<lb/></head>

			<p>Progress has been made on each of these fronts by the Institutions of the European Union and,<lb/> with the renewal of the Lisbon strategy in 2005, emphasis was put on the development of Better<lb/> Regulation policy in the Member States of the European Union. Having reached the half-way<lb/> stage of the Lisbon process started in 2005, the Commission decided to re-launch the strategy<lb/> with a focus on growth and jobs and a streamlined process to enhance Member States&apos;<lb/> ownership of their reform programmes. The implementation of Better Regulation policy is central<lb/> to the efforts to enhance productivity in the context of the Lisbon Strategy. The European Union<lb/> on its own, however, cannot boost productivity and employment. Member States also must play<lb/> their part through, for example, developing and implementing Better Regulation policy and using<lb/> Better Regulation tools effectively.<lb/> Member States are expected to recognise that action at EU level alone will not be enough to<lb/> achieve Better Regulation. The transposition by the Member States of EU legislation and national<lb/> regulatory initiatives have consequences, not just for national administrations and for citizens but<lb/> also for businesses, particularly SMEs, from across the Union. The development and<lb/> implementation of Better Regulation policy is, therefore, a priority to be addressed in the context<lb/> of implementing the Lisbon strategy. The importance of Better Regulation is mirrored in the<lb/></p>

The reform programmes should be geared to their own needs and specific situation,<lb/> allowing for the diversity of situations and policy priorities at national level. NRPs should be<lb/> conceived as forward-looking political documents setting out their 3 year strategy to deliver<lb/> growth and jobs. These programmes, together with their implementation reports, allow the<lb/> Commission to assess the policies and progress identified by Member States.<lb/> The Commission has done so in its last two Annual Progress Reports from January and<lb/> December 2006.</table>

			<p>In the latter one, the Commission issued country-specific recommendations and<lb/> pointed out that reforms begin to deliver benefits. At the same time, it emphasized that reforms<lb/> are at an early stage and will need to be fully followed through to make a lasting economic<lb/> impact.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU 23<lb/></head>

			<p>On 14 November 2006, the European Commission presented the results of a wide-ranging<lb/> Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU. The review assesses the progress to date and<lb/> makes an ambitious set of proposals.<lb/> One of the initiatives concerns the launch of an ambitious strategy to reduce the administrative<lb/> burden of existing regulation. The European Commission put forward a proposal to cut, jointly,<lb/> with Member States, the administrative burden for companies by 25% by 2012.<lb/> This, it is argued, could lead to an increase of an estimated 1.5 % in EU GDP and subsequently<lb/> more investment for growth and new jobs, amounting to €150 billion. To achieve this target,<lb/> Member States and regional and local authorities must also give a new political momentum to<lb/> their own efforts to cut red tape.<lb/> In March 2007, the Spring European Council underlined that reducing administrative burdens<lb/> is an important measure for boosting Europe&apos;s economy, especially through its impact on SMEs,<lb/> 16<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[</ref>COM(2005)97 final], http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2005/com2005_0097en01.pdf.

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>In some countries and in the institutions of the European Union, the principles underpinning<lb/> regulatory management are expressed in an explicit policy document designed to bring about<lb/> improvements in policy formulation and the drafting, enactment and enforcement of legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The basic indicators for a regulatory management policy include:<lb/> •<lb/> A policy on Better Regulation<lb/> •<lb/> Strategy for action and a process for prioritisation<lb/> •<lb/> Coherent and consistent process to formulate policy and draft legislation<lb/> •<lb/> Quality assurance<lb/> •<lb/> An appropriate number of suitably qualified personnel.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy on Better Regulation<lb/> Explicit Better Regulation Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>During the assessments of the NMS, a number of NMS began to develop an explicit policy on<lb/> Better Regulation. These included Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Slovenia. In some countries,<lb/> between the time of the initiation of the project and the completion of particular country reports,<lb/> the governments concerned had set up reform programmes that explicitly refer to Better<lb/> Regulation within the context of the Lisbon strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the government has developed, and at the time of the report was<lb/> improving, a policy which equates broadly to the Better Regulation policy of the</p>

			<table>EU. A<lb/> Government Resolution 27 was adopted on Reducing the Administrative Burden on Businesses. It<lb/> includes an Action Plan for Reducing Administrative Burden on Businesses as well as for the<lb/> Methodology of Measurement of Administrative Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost<lb/> Model 28 .<lb/> Poland developed an impressive programme that reflects a wide range of influences. The<lb/> priorities for its Better Regulation reform programme are:<lb/> •<lb/> Identification and implementation of legislative solutions for simplification of domestic<lb/> regulation and that of the acquis communautaire.<lb/> 27<lb/> No. 421/2005.<lb/> 28<lb/> See also the Standard Cost Model Manual pages 6 and 7 www.administratievelasten.nl/default.asp?<lb/> •<lb/> Improvement of the system of transposing EU Directives.<lb/> •<lb/> Reduction of administrative burdens.<lb/> •<lb/> Improvement of the RIA system.<lb/> •<lb/> Strengthening the regulatory management capacities of government.<lb/></table>

			<head>Implicit Better Regulation Policy<lb/></head>

			<p>In Hungary and the Slovak Republic, a Better Regulation policy may be seen from a study of<lb/> governance practices. Some Better Regulation tools are in place. The policy sets out the manner<lb/> in which policies are formulated and legislation is drafted and is primarily set out respectively in<lb/> the</p>

			<table>Organizational Order of the Slovak Republic Government Office and in the 1987 Legislation<lb/> Act in Hungary.<lb/> In Lithuania, the Strategy for Public Administration Development 29 stated that priority will be<lb/> given to areas and activities mentioned in the Medium Term Programme 2004-2005, adopted by<lb/> EU Ministers of Public Administration. One of the areas mentioned is Better Regulation. The<lb/> Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategy for year 2005-2006 30 contains the actions<lb/> designed to simplify decision making procedures. There have been further developments in<lb/> Lithuania since the completion of the assessment and an explicit Better Regulation policy was<lb/> being developed at the time of the writing of this report.<lb/> In Latvia, Better Regulation is mentioned in the National Development plan 2007-2013 as a<lb/> priority area 31 .<lb/> In other countries, there is an implicit reference to Better Regulation policy in many aspects of the<lb/> management of government activities.<lb/> All NMS participate in Better Regulation expert groups. These include the High Level Group on<lb/> Better Regulation established by the European Commission 32 , the Directors of Better<lb/> Regulation 33 and, where appropriate, the OECD Working Party on regulatory management.<lb/> Some countries, Poland, for example, have participated in benchmarking exercises in order to<lb/> exchange practices and benefit from the experience of OECD or EU member countries that have<lb/> already established a Better Regulation policy. Many of the countries studied (the Czech<lb/> Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Poland) are members of the Standard Cost<lb/> Model Network: steering committee 34 .<lb/> Political Support for Better Regulation<lb/> One of the factors critical to the success of Better Regulation is political support. This factor is<lb/> mentioned frequently in OECD reports 35 and political support for Better Regulation in the<lb/> Institutions of the European Union is, frequently, underpinned by speeches from Commissioners<lb/> and senior officials and is now extending to more specific areas of policy such as a move to<lb/> simplify the Common Agricultural Policy 36 .<lb/> 29<lb/> 2004 – 2010, approved by Government of Lithuania, Resolution No. 488 (Official Gazette 2004, No. 69-2399).<lb/> 30<lb/> Resolution No. 197 (Official Gazette 2005, No. 26-830).<lb/> 31<lb/> Following the terminology used in Latvia until 2006, Better Regulation activities were designated under the term &apos;impact<lb/> assessment&apos;.<lb/> 32<lb/> Commission Decision of 28 February 2006 setting up a group of high Level National regulatory Experts (2006/210/EU).<lb/> 33<lb/> Group of National experts undertaking work on Better Regulation in each Member State meet twice a year to exchange<lb/> information.<lb/> 34<lb/> See footnotes 107 and 108.<lb/> 35<lb/> See in particular OECD (1997), Regulatory Impact Analysis. Best Practice in OECD Countries, Paris; Taking Stock of<lb/> Regulatory Reform, 2005.<lb/> 36<lb/> See .europa.eu/agriculture/simplification/index_en.htm and for papers from a conference on the subject.<lb/> Responsibility for Better Regulation policy is conferred on different ministers in different<lb/> countries. The table below provides a representative cross section of how responsibility for Better<lb/> Regulation is spread in the NMS.<lb/> NMS<lb/> Ministry<lb/> Cyprus<lb/> Ministry for Finance<lb/> Czech Republic<lb/> Ministry of Interior 37<lb/> Estonia 38<lb/> Ministry for Justice<lb/> Latvia 39<lb/> Shared between State Chancellery, Ministry<lb/> of Justice and Ministry of Finance with the<lb/> Ministry for the Economy taking responsibility<lb/> for entrepreneurs.<lb/> Lithuania<lb/> Ministry for the Economy<lb/> Malta<lb/> Prime Minister&apos;s Office<lb/> Poland<lb/> Ministry for the Economy<lb/> Slovak Republic<lb/> Ministry for the Economy<lb/> Slovenia<lb/> Ministry for Public Administration<lb/></table>

			<p>The problem, put succinctly by one political figure in the Slovak Republic, is that the outcomes<lb/> from Better Regulation are too abstract to deliver clear political kudos. On the other hand,<lb/> regulatory failures are clearly visible. If a minister takes responsibility for Better Regulation and if<lb/> things go wrong he will get blamed. If things go well there will be no shortage of candidates to<lb/> claim the success as theirs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Government Programmes and Similar Documents<lb/></head>

			<p>Specific political support for Better Regulation-type policies may also be found in government<lb/> declarations or national reform programmes. These tend to be formulas. Without express dates<lb/> for delivery or defined outcomes, their value is questionable.<lb/></p>

			<head>The National Reform Programme of the Republic of Cyprus laid down priorities for</head>

			<p>the<lb/> implementation of a regulatory management reform. In that case, priority was attached within that<lb/> programme to the development of a policy on impact assessment and the reduction of the<lb/> regulatory and administrative burden.<lb/> In Estonia, the 2003 Coalition Agreement mentioned regulatory impact assessment and<lb/> proposed that the impact of each draft regulation on economic growth and the demographic<lb/> situation should be assessed. Another priority mentioned in that Agreement was the proposed<lb/> policy to simplify business start-up rules and the necessity to review regulations that restrict<lb/> business activity unecessarily. The current coalition agreement in Estonia refers to the need to<lb/> simplify the procedures related to dealings with local authorities by businesses.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the commitments made to implement the Better Regulation agenda,<lb/> relating in particular to the integrated impact assessments and the reduction of the administrative<lb/> burden imposed on businesses, were renewed in the</p>

			<table>National Reform Programme of the Czech<lb/> Republic (2005-2008) and in the Strategy for Economic Growth of the Czech Republic.<lb/> 37<lb/> In the Czech Republic, responsibility for Better Regulation was transferred from the Government Office to the Ministry of<lb/> Interior following a Government decision of October 2006.<lb/> 38<lb/> However, besides the Ministry of Justice, other ministries are involved.<lb/> 39<lb/> The implementation of the Better Regulation policy in Latvia remains with the State Chancellery. However, other ministries,<lb/> including the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy are also involved.<lb/> In Hungary, the 2006 programme for Government: New Hungary – Freedom and Solidarity: the<lb/> Programme of the Government of Hungary for a Successful, Modern and Just Hungary (2006 –<lb/> 2010) 40 commits Hungary to progress and recognises the growing number of small and medium<lb/> sized enterprises and the need to simplify a number of laws to facilitate competitiveness of small<lb/> businesses.<lb/> In Latvia, the Government Declaration, an important national policy statement, includes a<lb/> commitment to improving competitiveness 41 and identifies a number of policy issues<lb/> characteristic of a Better Regulation policy. These include, in particular, &quot; simplification of decision<lb/> making &quot; relating to small businesses 42 .<lb/> In Malta, a general outline of a Better Regulation policy is set out in the &apos;National Reform<lb/> Programme: Malta&apos;s strategy for growth and jobs for the period 2005 to 2008&apos; 43 . In addition, the<lb/> 2006-2010 Pre-Budget Document refers also to regulatory reform and to the necessity to reduce<lb/> regulatory burden on business.<lb/> In the Slovak Republic, support for the implementation of Better Regulation policy may be found<lb/> in the National Reform Programme of the Slovak Republic (2006 – 2008) and in the document<lb/> The Strategy of Competitiveness in Slovakia by 2010 – the National Lisbon Strategy, which<lb/> presents four top priorities of the Slovak government, one of them being increasing the quality of<lb/> the business environment.<lb/></table>

			<head>Structures to Implement a Better Regulation Policy (NMS)<lb/></head>

			<p>Better Regulation policy is most likely to be effective when there is a structure to implement it.<lb/> Three main approaches to the development of structures to implement Better Regulation policy<lb/> may be seen; a task force, a person or a central coordinating body or a combination of these<lb/> approaches.<lb/></p>

			<head>Task Force<lb/></head>

			<p>In Cyprus a group representative of a wide range of ministries and interests has been appointed<lb/> to develop a policy on impact assessment and determine what other aspects of a Better<lb/> Regulation policy can be developed. In Poland an inter-ministerial working group (the Task<lb/> Force for Modern Economic Regulation) was established in February 2006 to develop the policy<lb/> so as to enable it to be submitted for Council of Ministers approval. This Task Force will build on<lb/> the work done by the team appointed in 2000 (the Inter-ministerial Regulatory Quality Team) and<lb/> will deal with similar issues, but with a stronger focus on both improving the regulatory<lb/> environment for business, and making use of the regulatory tools more effectively. In Slovenia,<lb/> an inter-ministerial working group was established to develop and manage a Better Regulation<lb/> policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Person or a Central Coordinating Body<lb/></head>

			<p>In Estonia, responsibility for Better Regulation policy is spread across the Ministry for the<lb/> Economy, Ministry for Justice, Ministry for Social Affairs and Ministry for the Environment.<lb/> However, one official is primarily responsible for receiving and disseminating information about<lb/> Better Regulation policy. She attends international meetings on Better Regulation issues and<lb/> ensures that information on international developments is passed on to the rest of the public<lb/> service</p>

It has, since November<lb/> 2006, been moved to the Ministry for the Interior. It is responsible for coordinating Regulatory<lb/> Reform across the state administration as well as the preparation of strategy papers in this area.<lb/> In Hungary, an independent Department was established in the Ministry of Justice, called the<lb/> Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law, to provide professional<lb/> support for quality legislation and improve the quality of impact assessment. However, this Unit<lb/> was abolished in July 2006 as part of the cut backs in the size of the public sector. Its functions<lb/> were partially transferred to another part of the Ministry for Justice.<lb/> In Latvia, the Policy Coordination Department of the State Chancellery is responsible for<lb/> designing and implementing the policy and strategic planning system, which includes the Better<lb/> Regulation policy. The latter are prepared in cooperation with line ministries, which are in charge<lb/> of checking the quality of impact assessment, according to their respective areas of competence.<lb/> In Malta, Better Regulation is the responsibility of the Better Regulation Unit within the<lb/> Management Efficiency Unit (MEU). The MEU operates in the Office of the Prime Minister and<lb/> plays a unique role of an in-house management consultant to the Government. It has developed<lb/> some experience of impact assessment. The Better Regulation Unit established in December<lb/> 2005 in Malta forms part of the MEU and is, therefore, part of the Office of the Prime Minister.<lb/> The mandate of the Unit is to monitor regulatory developments and reduce unnecessary<lb/> bureaucracy.<lb/></table>

			<head>A Combination of These Approaches<lb/></head>

			<p>In Poland, an inter-ministerial working group (the Task Force for Modern Economic Regulation)<lb/> was established in February 2006 to develop the Better Regulation policy so as to enable it to be<lb/> submitted for Council of Ministers approval. There is also a strong, well managed Department in<lb/> the Ministry for the Economy and added competencies were given to the Office of the Prime<lb/> Minister to oversee impact assessments. It is also proposed to appoint an official in each<lb/> ministry, with responsibility for Better Regulation.<lb/> The Polish model reflects the need to have coordination mechanisms in place and the need is<lb/> recognised to share responsibilities for implementing the Better Regulation policy with line<lb/> ministries in order to create a sense of ownership of Better Regulation amongst all civil servants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strategy for Action and a Process for Prioritisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Government consists of institutions responsible for formulating policies and taking collective<lb/> decisions for society. These decisions may be taken in accordance with a fixed, centrally<lb/> controlled plan, a flexible, strategic plan or decisions can be made ad hoc without any planning<lb/> reacting to circumstances as they arise. All NMS operate with a mix of these arrangements.<lb/> Governments, usually, come into office with a plan which is a version of manifestos compromised<lb/> to fit in with a coalition partner&apos;s needs.<lb/> Government plans, or strategies to identify problems for action, need to be underpinned by three<lb/> main elements: a clear set of policy priorities, planning procedures and institutions involved in<lb/> planning co-ordination and dispute resolution process when there are conflicts to be resolved.<lb/> The latter is of most importance when there are coalitions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy Priorities<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the implementation of EU law is considered to be the highest priority. The next level<lb/> of priority is Government programmes. Lithuania is unique in that a strategy is decided for the<lb/> country that stays in place regardless of the political parties in power.<lb/> In Latvia, the overarching strategies are set out in the Government Declaration and the Single<lb/> Strategy of National Economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, the overall strategic plan for policy activities is set out in the Slovak<lb/> Government Programme Proclamation. This type of approach is broadly similar for all countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Planning Process<lb/></head>

			<p>A well-structured policy planning process is an essential part of regulatory management. It<lb/> ensures that government strategy for collective action is implemented. Prorities may be identified,<lb/> initially, by government on the basis of political programmes or may result from an administrative<lb/> planning procedure. Overarching policy documents exist in all NMS, though the approach to<lb/> compilation varies and the extent to which they are adhered to is dependent on factors such as<lb/> party discipline within government.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic</head>

			<p>party discipline is weak and planning is less<lb/> effective. Alternative policy proposals arise frequently in Bills and amendments, which move the<lb/> national agenda away from its overall plan. In these countries Bills, or amendments to<lb/> government Bills, can be proposed even by members of the same party as the government. This<lb/> increases the unpredictability of legislation and distorts the planning process.<lb/></p>

			<table>In the Czech Republic, planning priorities are identified following two processes. A Government<lb/> Policy Statement is prepared on the basis of a list of strategic priorities for the forthcoming 4-year<lb/> legislature, reflecting priorities selected by each ministry for areas of competence. In addition, the<lb/> Annual Plan of Legislative Actions of the Government and the Annual Plan of Non-Legislative<lb/> Actions of the Government are prepared by the Government Office, on the basis of the<lb/> Government Policy Statement, and are approved by the Government each year. In Slovenia, a<lb/> similar process is followed that separates out the strategic plans from the more tactical, biennial<lb/> budget plan and the annual legislative plan.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Hungary, policy priorities are, mostly, determined on the basis of the government programme<lb/> (generated from party programmes) or as a consequence of day – to – day issues arising. In<lb/> addition, each ministry has a programme which sets out with greater particularity its approach to<lb/> the implementation of the Government programme. There is also a six-monthly legislation list<lb/> which sets out the legislative programme of the government. In Hungary, in practice, a dynamic<lb/> political system throws up issues regularly not foreseen in any plans and as much as 50% of the<lb/> legislative output arises from proposals not set out in the Government programme.<lb/> In Lithuania, these plans include long-term (more than 7 years), medium-term (3 to 7 years) and<lb/> short-term (1 to 3 years) planning. It operates from bottom to top and from top to bottom. The<lb/> long-term State Development Strategy is at the top of the pyramid of the different planning<lb/> documents and serves as the basis for development of sectoral strategies for three to seven<lb/> years. Vice versa, sectoral strategies can lead to changes in the long-term State Development<lb/> Strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p>When preparing their three-year strategic plans, ministries and other public institutions take into<lb/> account the objectives set out in sectoral strategies. The Action Plan to implement the<lb/> Government Programme adopted by a newly appointed government, within 3 months of the<lb/> approval of the Government Programme, outlines specific Government actions to be taken within<lb/> a four-year period following its publication. The strength of the planning process lies in the fact<lb/> that, irrespective of the Government in power, there is a continuity of strategy as regards national<lb/> goals, including regulatory management goals. There is a high level of transparency at every<lb/> level of the planning process, from the macro plan for the Government as a whole to the micro<lb/> plans in Departments within ministries which also have plans to give effect to the objectives of<lb/> these ministries.<lb/> In Malta 44 , proposals arise from consultation with departments, agencies and commissions, and<lb/> priorities are determined on a case by case basis, depending on the importance and urgency of<lb/> the matter.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, strategic planning for policy activities is set out in the Slovak<lb/> Government Programme Proclamation, as a macro tool, and in the Plan for Legislative Tasks of<lb/> the Government, as a micro tool. However, a sizeable number of legislative proposals is based<lb/> on proposals originating outside government. These may even include proposals made by<lb/> members of the political party in Government.<lb/></p>

			<head>An Effective Structure to Coordinate Policy Planning<lb/></head>

			<p>The efficiency of a policy planning system is strengthened whenever a body or ministry is<lb/> entrusted with policy planning coordination, but coordination at the centre of government needs<lb/> to be effective.<lb/></p>

			<table>In Cyprus, responsibility for the planning of strategic and developmental policy activity is vested<lb/> in the Cyprus Planning Bureau. Planning of other policy initiatives rests with individual ministries.<lb/> The Planning Bureau was established following a decision of the Council of Ministers and placed<lb/> under the Minister of Finance. In cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, it is responsible for the<lb/> 5-year strategic plans laying out all the development projects and coordinates the planning<lb/> procedures for the country.<lb/> In Latvia, the planning of Government actions, at the time of the Sigma review, was managed by<lb/> the Policy Coordination Department of the State Chancellery.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Lithuania, government priorities are usually set in March along with the budget formation<lb/> process. When developing cross-cutting policies to implement priorities, all the necessary policy<lb/> documents have to be discussed with interested parties and institutions. The majority of strategic<lb/> documents are discussed by the Government Strategic Planning Committee, before their<lb/> approval by the Government. It is a platform for policy review as well as a suitable format to<lb/> negotiate and solve contentious issues and coordinate priorities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Procedures to Resolve Conflicts Between Priorities<lb/></head>

			<p>A clear strategy to identify problems for collective action and a process for prioritisation by means<lb/> of policy or regulatory intervention is necessary to ensure a smooth regulatory management.<lb/></p>

			<p>The deciding factor for resolution of political priority conflict is often the extent to which the<lb/> proposals must be within budgetary limits. For example, in Cyprus, priority is given to policies<lb/> which are budgeted for in the annual budget. In Hungary, the Ministry of Finance has emerged<lb/> as a dominant ministerial Department, since the far reaching reforms in the system of public<lb/> budgeting that took place in Hungary in the 1990s. In Latvia, medium term government priorities<lb/> are established by a Government decision. In Malta, differences of opinion between ministries on<lb/> priorities, or on the allocation of resources, are resolved bilaterally or in consultation with the<lb/> Ministry for Finance.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all NMS, conflicts that can not be resolved at ministerial level in relation to planning and<lb/> prioritising of policy issues are submitted to meetings of the government (</p>

			<table>Council of Ministers) for<lb/> resolution. The ultimate authority to arbitrate and resolve disputes varies in accordance with the<lb/> constitutional structure of the country concerned. This function is performed by the President of<lb/> the Republic (Cyprus) or the Prime Minister (Lithuania). In all NMS, the relevant authority,<lb/> 44<lb/> Malta has three overarching policy documents: &apos;A Better Quality of Life: 2006-2010 Pre-Budget Document&apos; and the &apos;National<lb/> Reform Programme: Malta&apos;s Strategy for Growth and Jobs for the period 2005 to 2008 – Public C Consultation Document&apos;<lb/> and the &apos;National Strategic Reference&apos; which was drafted to address issues related to the distribution of &apos;Objective One&apos;<lb/> Structural Funds.<lb/> President or Prime Minister, receives regular reports on progress and oversees the development<lb/> and implementation of plans.<lb/></table>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the government represents the most important coordination mechanism<lb/> at the level of the central state administration. If a settlement on a particular issue cannot be<lb/> achieved at a lower level, it is raised to the level of deputy ministers and then presented to the<lb/> Cabinet as an &quot; unsettled issue &quot; , if any disagreement still remains. The latter shall decide such<lb/> cases.<lb/> In Hungary, in 2000, a new system of policy coordination, called the Referatura, was created in<lb/> the Office of the Prime Minister. This special body, modelled on one existing in the German<lb/> Chancellery, is composed of a group of experts who shadow each ministry&apos;s activities. Together<lb/> with a lawyer from the Prime Minister&apos;s Office Legal Department, they prepare a joint note on all<lb/> submissions. The joint note describes the proposal, the outcome of inter-ministerial<lb/> consultations, unresolved issues, and proposals for improvement.<lb/> In Latvia, key draft policy documents and draft regulations, for which a special working group has<lb/> been set up 45 , are circulated to ministries before they are submitted to a weekly meeting of the<lb/> State Secretaries (the highest ranking civil servants of all ministries). Following the Rules of<lb/> Procedure of the Government, a summary of all ministry proposals, including arguments for<lb/> accepting or rejecting each proposal is prepared, and accompanies the draft document when it is<lb/> returned to the meeting of the State Secretaries and forwarded to the Government for approval.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to meetings of the Government in Lithuania, regular inter-ministerial meetings are<lb/> used as an important structure to resolve conflicts between priorities before policy proposals are<lb/> submitted to the government for a final decision. In Malta, inter-ministerial meetings at technical<lb/> and political level are regularly held but there are no formalised procedures 46 .<lb/></p>

			<p>A similar procedure exists in Hungary, where the penultimate stage of the legislative process is a<lb/> meeting of the Administrative State Secretaries. In this case policy documents are circulated to<lb/> ministries before the State Secretaries&apos; meeting if a special working group is set up to draft a<lb/> policy document.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many coalition governments in Latvia have had an alternative body for deliberations, called the<lb/> Coalition Council. It consists of equal representation of all parties represented in the governing<lb/> coalition and under some governments it has acquired an unofficial, yet key, place in the<lb/> decision-making process. The Coalition Council can be used as a place to resolve politically<lb/> sensitive issues, and to reach decisions, which are then officially adopted in the Cabinet of<lb/> Ministers&apos; meetings. The issues discussed at the Coalition Council are draft policy proposals and<lb/> draft legislation already consulted at ministerial level. This alternative forum operates outside<lb/> official channels, does not follow procedures set out for policy-making, and is not open to public<lb/> scrutiny.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Poland, all draft legislation must be subjected to scrutiny within the permanent Cabinet<lb/> Committee at the Secretary of State level before it is submitted to the Cabinet.<lb/></p>

			<head>45<lb/></head>

			<p>The word regulation is used here to include primary and secondary legislation. Policy documents for which no working group<lb/> has been set up are circulated to ministries only after the State Secretaries&apos; meeting.<lb/></p>

			<head>46<lb/></head>

			<p>At the Technical level there are: monthly meeting of Permanent Secretaries chaired by the Principal Permanent Secretary,<lb/> weekly meeting of EU Affairs Directors. Other regular meetings: Forum for Corporate Services Directors (Human resources,<lb/> finance), Forum for Policy Development Directors, Forum for Programme Implementation Directors, ICT Forum. Discussions<lb/> held within these fora are reported to the Permanent Secretaries.<lb/> At the political level, there is a: weekly meeting of the Cabinet on the basis of Cabinet papers circulated beforehand, weekly<lb/> meeting of the Prime Minister, Permanent Secretaries for Finance and the Principal Permanent Secretary. Monthly meeting of<lb/> Cabinet Committee support units: there is one cabinet committee for each key sector (environment, tourism, capital projects,<lb/> competitiveness). The Prime Minister chairs these Committees, which gather key ministries, e.g., the Principal Permanent<lb/> Secretary, Cabinet Secretaries and some stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, differences of opinion between ministries, as regards draft legislation,<lb/> are resolved by bilateral discussions or upon a meeting of the Directors General. Legislation can<lb/> not be submitted to the Council of Ministers until these disputes are resolved. However, in the<lb/> case of substantial comments, the conflict may be resolved by the Council of Ministers.<lb/></p>

			<head>A Transparent and Well-structured Process<lb/></head>

			<p>All of the NMS reviewed had a transparent and well-structured process for policy formulation and<lb/> legislation drafting. They all have rules or systems in place to formulate policy, draft legislation<lb/> and submit the outcome to government. All NMS have adopted a framework broadly similar to<lb/> that recommended in the OECD Reference Checklist for Regulatory Decision Making 47 , namely,<lb/> that the following questions should be asked when formulating policy:<lb/></p>

			<table>•<lb/> Is the problem correctly defined?<lb/> •<lb/> Is government action justified?<lb/> •<lb/> Is regulation the best form of government action?<lb/> •<lb/> Is there a legal basis for regulation?<lb/> •<lb/> What is the appropriate level (or levels) of government for this action?<lb/> •<lb/> Does the benefit of the regulation justify the costs?<lb/> •<lb/> Is the distribution effect across society transparent?<lb/> •<lb/> Is the regulation clear, consistent, comprehensible and accessible to users?<lb/> •<lb/> Have all interested parties had the opportunity to present their views?<lb/> •<lb/> How will compliance be achieved?<lb/></table>

			<p>The decision to develop a policy may be taken by government or an individual minister. The<lb/> nature of the decision (government or ministerial decision) depends on the size and complexity of<lb/> the problem to solve and the extent of resources required. In the case of the former, government<lb/> decisions are, usually, preceded by a process that includes consultation within and across<lb/> ministries. In the case of secondary legislation, the process is simpler and inter-ministerial<lb/> consultation is, usually, not necessary.<lb/> However, in Malta proposals for secondary legislation must be notified and approved of by the<lb/> Office of the Prime Minister. This approach avoids ministers making regulations that are in<lb/> conflict with the policies of the government as a whole or the making of regulations that conflict<lb/> with regulations made by other ministers. In Cyprus, secondary legislation is subject to a more<lb/> detailed review in the parliament than is usual in any other NMS.<lb/></p>

			<head>Iterative Sequence<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the policy formulation process begins with a decision in principle, at a political level,<lb/> to initiate the policy development cycle. The decision may originate from any one of a number of<lb/> sources. Policy sources are similar in all countries, though the mix varies. Policies may derive<lb/> from government manifestoes, coalition agreements, court cases, short-term emergencies,<lb/> international obligations.<lb/> Following the decision, in principle, to initiate the policy-making cycle, policy formulation follows a<lb/> similar iterative sequence in all NMS. The official concerned with the policy, initially, conducts<lb/> desk research on the problem and identifies if the problem has been dealt with domestically or<lb/> internationally, and develops a solution, in</p>

			<table>consultation with colleagues within and across<lb/> 47<lb/> OECD, Recommendations of the OECD on Improving the Quality of Government Regulation (Adopted 9 March 1995). See<lb/> also OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance, endorsed by Council of OECD 28 April 2005,<lb/> OCDE/GD/95(95).<lb/> ministries, and with interested stakeholders. In Slovenia, the Government Rules of Procedure<lb/> require officials to make a comparative study of three other countries as part of this stage of the<lb/> process.<lb/></table>

			<head>Distinction between Policy Formulation and Regulation Drafting<lb/></head>

			<p>The most striking difference between policy formulation and regulation drafting procedures in the<lb/> NMS could usually be traced to whether the countries had been influenced by common law or<lb/> civil law traditions. In addition, countries that had formerly fallen within the communist sphere of<lb/> influence have also undergone significant modernisation of their structures and processes and<lb/> even had experienced complete turnover of personnel. In some NMS, notably Estonia and<lb/> Latvia, the levels of experience and institutional memory were considerably less than in others.<lb/> However, in most NMS there is a limited number of officials with experience of legislative<lb/> drafting. This problem is understood and is being addressed in Poland and Hungary, where<lb/> there are some facilities for training officials to draft legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other than the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, there is little formal distinction<lb/> between policy formulation and regulation drafting. This is reasonable in the case of simple policy<lb/> activities, as there is often little need to separate out the two processes. However, for substantial<lb/> policy issues, it is generally regarded as useful to separate the policy formulation activity from law<lb/> drafting. In practice, most knowledgeable people interviewed, in all of the NMS, were of the view<lb/> that there should be some form of division of labour or, at the very least, a separation of the</p>

			<table>two<lb/> tasks.<lb/> Various rules in NMS prescribe how policies are to be prepared and presented to government<lb/> and to parliament. There are some subject-specific general rules for the development of policies<lb/> and drafting of regulations 49 . Special rules are laid down also for implementing certain types of<lb/> strategy and action plans, e.g., in the energy sector, forestry and agriculture.<lb/> In Hungary, the legislative procedure is regulated by the Constitution and the Legislation Act<lb/> 1987. Chapter two of that Act provides that proposals for new laws should be subject to<lb/> preliminary studies and use clear language and that identical or similar issues should be<lb/> regulated in the same laws. It also prescribes that citizens should participate in the formulation of<lb/> legislation. A Government Decision relating to Governmental Procedures 50 prescribes, among<lb/> other matters, the details of the intra-governmental consent mechanism and the content, required<lb/> by law in Hungary, of any proposals to be submitted to government.<lb/> Latvia has enacted an Administrative Procedure Law 51 which sets out general provisions for the<lb/> functioning of the administration. The Rules of Procedure of Government 52 regulate the<lb/> procedures of government. Policies must be drawn up in accordance with these rules which<lb/> include, for example, the classification and structure of policy documents as well as the<lb/> Procedure for Filling in Annotations of Draft Regulations 53 . The annotations are the explanatory<lb/> materials that accompany a draft regulation sent to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the<lb/> parliament. They include an assessment of the economic and social impacts of the draft<lb/> regulation considered, as well as the impact it may have on the state budget.<lb/> Similar materials in Lithuanian law are to be found in the Law on Government, which sets out<lb/> how the government programme is to be implemented. There are also guidelines prepared by the<lb/> Ministry of Justice, which specify the structure to be followed to present proposals for<lb/> regulations 54 . Rules for inter-ministerial consultation and co-ordination are prescribed by the<lb/> Government Rules of Procedure approved by a government resolution 55 . Paragraph 49 of the<lb/> Rules on Consultation &apos;Requirements for legislation Drafting and Approval&apos; contains a list of I<lb/> nstitutions with which regulations have to be discussed prior to submission to government.<lb/> In Poland, the procedure for the development of government draft primary legislation is set out in<lb/> the Law on Organisation and Rules of Procedure of the Council of Ministers and in the Sphere of<lb/> Competence of Ministers of 8 August 1996, together with its implementing regulations. Officials<lb/> formulating policy and drafting legislation also need to have regard to the Principles of Legislative<lb/> Technique set out in a regulation of the Ordinance of the Prime Minister on Principles of<lb/> Legislative Techniques 56 .<lb/> The Organisational Order of the Slovak Republic Government Office lays down basic principles<lb/> for the overall management of state administration. Further details regarding the role of the<lb/> Government Office in this regard are set out in the Statute of the Slovak Republic Government<lb/> Office. However, the Slovak Republic is a special case as the division of labour between officials<lb/> 49<lb/> For example, the Aarhus&apos; Convention requires a Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment.<lb/> 50<lb/> No. 1088/1994.<lb/> 51<lb/> November 2001.<lb/> 52<lb/> March 2002.<lb/> 53<lb/> Council of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia, 18 September 2001. See also amendments July 12 2002 and June 11 2004.<lb/> 54<lb/></table>

			<p>Structure to be followed: there should be a legal basis for the law; there should be a proper legal evaluation of the proposal;<lb/> there should be a reference to related laws and steps taken to avoid conflict with other laws or duplication of laws; there<lb/> should be an explanation of why the law is needed; there should be a description of how the problem has been solved in<lb/> other countries; there should be a reference to relevant E U or international laws, if any; the proposal should explain fully its<lb/> purpose; the financial, economic and other impacts of the proposal should be assessed and referred to; reference should be<lb/> made to the structure of the law when fully drafted; reference should be made to any other law to be amended.<lb/></p>

			<head>55<lb/></head>

			<table>No. 728 (OG 1994, No. 63-1238).<lb/> 56<lb/> 20 June 2002.<lb/> who prepare policy papers and those who draft the legislation mirrors the procedure followed in<lb/> countries with a common law tradition or which have been influenced by such tradition, where<lb/> legislation is drafted by lawyers who have specific skills in drafting legislation.<lb/> The Rules of Procedure of the Government of Slovenia and the Rules of Procedure of the<lb/> Slovenian National Assembly regulate, respectively, the organisation of the government and the<lb/> parliament. The former provide, among other matters, for the role of the Prime Minister,<lb/> organisation of the work of government, working parties of government, government councils,<lb/> format of government documents and the usual matters relating to the organisation of<lb/> government.<lb/></table>

			<p>This pattern is followed in most of the civil law countries studied, though the terminology varies<lb/> and a range of legislative titles covers this field, including Administrative Procedures Acts, Law<lb/> on Government or Organisational Orders.<lb/></p>

			<p>In NMS which have been influenced by common law traditions, there are, usually, no<lb/> standardised administrative procedures required by law to ensure that policy action takes place<lb/> at the appropriate level of government. Much of the policy-making process is regulated by<lb/> custom or by procedures developed by ministries.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Cyprus and Malta</head>

			<p>, the operation of the policy formulation and legislation drafting process is a<lb/> matter of custom, or circulars issued for internal use, rather than something which is regulated by<lb/> rules of law or procedure, as is the case in the civil law world.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality Assurance — Institutions<lb/></head>

			<p>Experience in OECD countries suggests that good regulatory management requires a quality<lb/> assurance process that validates the flow of proposed regulations against good regulatory<lb/> principles. Regulatory management should also address the stock of regulations. This is a<lb/> particularly important issue for all NMS, due to the pace and pattern of the implementation of the<lb/> acquis communautaire. It can not be assumed that unnecessary regulatory burdens have not<lb/> been imposed or that all new laws enacted post-independence are a perfect match with<lb/> regulations that were already in place. Officials in all of the NMS acknowledge that the acquis<lb/> was adopted at a very high speed and that a period of review and reflection is needed so as to<lb/> confirm that the acquis has been adopted effectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is arguable that a quality assurance process needs to function horizontally, as regards the<lb/> implementation of an overarching policy on regulatory management and vertically, within each<lb/> body responsible for making regulations. The quality assurance process may be generalised for<lb/> the flow of regulations and may be generalised for the stock of regulations or may be undertaken<lb/> in particular sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are two main models of quality review in the NMS. The first is where quality review is<lb/> undertaken by a series of reviews within ministries, and across ministries, and sometimes with<lb/> outside bodies. These include reviews by:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Office of the Prime Minister (however called).<lb/> •<lb/> Ministry of Justice.<lb/> •<lb/> Ministry of Finance.<lb/> •<lb/> Inter and intra-ministry reviews.<lb/></p>

				<formula>•<lb/> Courts.<lb/></formula>

			<p>The second model is where reviews are undertaken by a specially designated committee or<lb/> body. The former approach predominates and the latter tends to be confined to technical, legal<lb/> issues. No NMS review the quality of legislation specifically to ascertain the extent to which the<lb/> flow of new legislation complies with Better Regulation principles. In all NMS, the bodies involved<lb/> in regulation quality checking have very heavy work loads, which result in delays in the<lb/> preparation of legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Review by the Office of the Prime Minister or other body at the centre of government<lb/></head>

			<p>Typically, the Office of the Prime Minister is involved from the point of view of the consistency of<lb/> the proposals with government policy. The role varies in accordance with the extent to which the<lb/> Prime Minister is a powerful figure in the system. In some NMS at the time of the</p>

			<table>Sigma review,<lb/> for example, in Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia, the Prime Minister and the<lb/> Prime Minister&apos;s Office were very powerful.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Hungary, a special unit composed of advisers, and established in February 2006 within the<lb/> Office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for summarising the opinions expressed on<lb/> regulations proposed by the government during the technical, policy reconciliation process. This<lb/> is designed to filter out problems relating to the quality of, or the necessity for, the proposed<lb/> legislation. Inadequately prepared proposals are rejected at this stage.<lb/> In Latvia, the State Chancellery plays a very central role in a number of ways, notably in<lb/> reviewing draft laws to ensure their conformity with strategic plans, political priorities and legal<lb/> technicalities. In addition, it controls the quality of legislation through the &apos;Annotations&apos; process.<lb/> The State Chancellery is the body responsible for enforcing procedures and rules as regards<lb/> policy-making and strategic planning. Proposals not completed in accordance with the law are<lb/> sent back to ministries and are not dealt with until they are in the proper form.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Lithuania, the Office of Government plays an important role in the quality assurance process.<lb/> These tasks are shared in the Chancellery by a number of directorates, including the Strategic<lb/> Planning Directorate, the European Directorate and the Legal Directorate.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The review by the Office of Government ensures conformity with national plans and strategies.<lb/> The Office of Government, Legal Division, also reviews drafts from the point of view of legality<lb/> and legal technicalities. The Legal section, however, has the advantage that it is represented at<lb/> the weekly meeting of the State Secretaries which reviews proposals before they are finally<lb/> submitted to Government. This gives the Legal Section the influence, if not the power, to block a<lb/> proposal if, potentially, it could give rise to legal problems.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ministry of Justice<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS except Cyprus, the Ministry of Justice is involved from the point of view of<lb/> constitutional and legal issues. In Estonia, for example, the Ministry of Justice is the ministry<lb/> responsible for legal quality at the start of the drafting process. Once the concept of a draft law is<lb/> approved by the Ministry of Justice it may be drafted into legislation. The Legal Chancellor also<lb/> has a role in the quality assurance process.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Hungary, the Ministry of Justice has a role in Better Regulation issues though this was<lb/> reduced during the assessment process. In 2005, a special unit was established in the Ministry<lb/> (Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law). That Unit was to be<lb/> responsible for assuring the quality of impact assessments; however, it was abolished in July<lb/> 2006.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Latvia, the Ministry of Justice reviews drafts from the point of view of legal technicalities,<lb/> consistency with the Constitution, with the general principles of law and with existing regulations<lb/> and conformity with strategic plans, with political priorities and with norms of international law.<lb/> This responsibility includes also a review of drafts to ensure compliance with European norms.<lb/> The State Chancellery, together with the Ministry of Justice, ensures clarity and coherence of<lb/> drafts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Review by the Ministry of Finance<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the Ministry of Finance reviews drafts from the point of view of budgetary issues so<lb/> as to ensure that the proposals are within budgetary limits. For example, in Cyprus draft laws<lb/> submitted to the Council of Ministers must be accompanied by a written opinion of the Ministry of<lb/> Finance, except in cases where there is no connection with budgetary issues. The Constitution<lb/> provides that every bill submitted to Parliament must be accompanied by a report called &quot;Objects<lb/> and Reasons&quot; signed by the Attorney – General of the Republic.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inter and Intra-ministry Reviews<lb/></head>

			<p>In some NMS, legal departments within each ministry have a role in reviewing the quality of<lb/> legislation drafted within the ministry and in other ministries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Hungary, the Legal Department of a given ministry is obliged to ensure that the regulation<lb/> produced by the ministry is compatible with the legal system and rulings of the Constitutional<lb/> Court. In addition, within a ministry there are Operational Rules designed to ensure consistency<lb/> within a ministry. The inter-ministerial cross-review, for example, in the Czech Republic,<lb/> Hungary and in the Slovak Republic is a form of quality review. In theory, the ultimate review of<lb/> quality is undertaken by the government (Council of Ministers) when it examines draft legislation.<lb/> In Estonia, the circulation of drafts is organised by an electronic system called e-law (e-õigus),<lb/> administered by the Ministry of Justice. The system enables a comprehensive circulation of all<lb/> relevant materials and a straightforward process of commenting on drafts. From the moment that<lb/> the ministry has prepared a concept of a draft law, it is inserted into the electronic coordination<lb/> system and sent to the Ministry of Justice, electronically, through that system for approval. Later<lb/> in the process, when a draft law needs the approval of line ministries, the draft, the explanatory<lb/> letter and any annexes may be inserted into the electronic coordination system, which<lb/> automatically sends a message to the ministry which is required to send its opinion on the draft.<lb/> From this moment, all relevant documents may be consulted by the public. 57<lb/></p>

			<p>In Latvia the interministerial consultation process is organized by the electronic circulation of<lb/> documents using the government web page. From the moment of the &apos;annoncement&apos; of a draft in<lb/> the Meeting of State Secretaries, each draft and annotations of Bills and other legal instruments<lb/> are made available for public consultation. Ministries now only use the electronic form of<lb/> documents in the process of analysing and giving opinions on proposed drafts. Government<lb/> meetings are also organised around the electronic circulation of documents (e-portfolio).<lb/></p>

			<p>A similar system is to be introduced in Slovenia with an editorial function similar to a spell check<lb/> which will enable officials to verify style usages.<lb/> In Poland, the Permanent Cabinet Committee (KRM) may delay the consideration of proposed<lb/> draft legislation by asking the department to remedy formal defects, such as the absence of the<lb/> list of differences, EU compatibility assessment, and public consultations. If these problems are<lb/> not addressed within 14 days, the secretary has the authority to stop the document from being<lb/> considered at the KRM.<lb/></p>

			<head>Role of Courts<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the Constitution provides for a mechanism ensuring the constitutionality of laws,<lb/> through the establishment of a</p>

			<table>Supreme Court or Constitutional Court. It examines the<lb/> Constitutionality or compatibility of the law with international treaties and European law. Its<lb/> decisions of a policy nature are taken into consideration and policies and legislation adapted<lb/> accordingly.<lb/> 57<lb/> This also contrasts with the secrecy and formality that surrounds this type of process in older democracies.<lb/> In Cyprus, a problem arose which resulted in the Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional a<lb/> legal provision introduced while implementing a Directive. This problem has now been solved by<lb/> law 127 (I) of 2006 which has amended the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, so as to<lb/> establish the supremacy of the acquis communautaire over the constitutional provisions.<lb/></table>

			<p>An unresolved issue in Hungary, in relation to the role of the Supreme Court is its jurisdiction as<lb/> regards the control of the transposition of directives into the Hungarian legal system.<lb/> In Hungary, the Constitutional Court plays a very active role in the quality review of regulations.<lb/> Decisions of the Court have a significant effect on the content of regulation in that officials<lb/> drafting legislation need to take into account decisions of the Constitutional Court. Its quality<lb/> control role has evolved since its creation. During the first 8-9 years, the primary task was to<lb/> facilitate the transition from one legal regime to another. In the second phase of the development<lb/> of the court, the two main areas of activity were: the constitutional control of proposed legislation<lb/> and the supervision of the operations of state organs, from a constitutional point of view.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Hungarian Constitutional Court also issued rulings supporting the use of Better Regulation<lb/> tools, contributing, indirectly, to strengthening the quality check of legislation. It has been asked<lb/> to consider the consequences of a failure to consult on a piece of legislation. The case<lb/> concerned environment legislation which included a compulsory statutory requirement to consult.<lb/> The consultation did not take place and the Constitutional Court was called on to determine<lb/> whether a regulation made without the necessary consultation taking place might be declared<lb/> unconstitutional 58 . The court held that the failure to consult with the Environmental Council, in<lb/> accordance with the law, invalidated the law made without the proper consultation process being<lb/> followed. However, in another case, the Court ruled that for Acts of the National Assembly, the<lb/> failure by the government to consult a particular group did not invalidate the law.<lb/></p>

			<head>Specialist Bodies Responsible for Quality Review<lb/></head>

			<p>In some countries, there are designated bodies to review draft laws from the point of view of<lb/> consistency of a draft with the Constitution and the general principles of law.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Cyprus, by virtue of the Constitution, the Attorney General of the Republic is the legal adviser<lb/> of the Government. All drafts of proposed legislation must be seen by the Attorney General<lb/> before they are submitted to the Council of Ministers. All draft legislation must pass through the<lb/> Office of the Attorney General. In some cases, this results in redrafts by that Office to assure the<lb/> legality and constitutionality.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the quality review process is assured by the Legislation Council of the<lb/> Government (LCG) which reviews the legal aspects of the draft. Some criteria are laid down in<lb/> the Legislative Rules of Government. These ensure that attention is given to the quality of the<lb/> legal text and to matters such as organisation, clarity and comprehensibility of the drafts.<lb/></p>

			<p>The LCG is an independent committee, consisting of civil servants, independent experts and<lb/> academics, chaired by the minister responsible for legislation. The Council is divided into several<lb/> working groups, each responsible for a respective area of public, private or criminal law. It is<lb/> supported by a permanent Secretariat called the Government Legislation Office, which is a part<lb/> of the</p>

			<table>Government Office.<lb/> In Malta, the Attorney General has a role similar to that of the Chief Law Officer in Cyprus and<lb/> reviews all drafts of primary and secondary legislation from the point of view of constitutionality<lb/> and consistency with the general principles of law. Once drafted, legislation must be referred to<lb/> the Office of the Attorney General for review and to be translated into Maltese before submission<lb/> 58<lb/> Resolution No. 30/2000.<lb/> to Government (primary legislation) or signature by a Minister (secondary legislation). All<lb/> legislation is drafted in Maltese and English. In case of conflict, the Maltese version prevails.<lb/> In Poland, there are two bodies concerned with legislative quality: the Government Legislation<lb/> Centre (GLC) and the Legislative Council. The GLC was originally established within the<lb/> Chancellery of the Prime Minister but it was made into an independent body in 2000 59 . It is,<lb/> nevertheless, answerable to the Prime Minister.<lb/> The GLC coordinates the government&apos;s legislative activity, provides legal advice to government,<lb/> prepares government drafts and advises on parliament&apos;s drafts 60 . Its head participates in the<lb/> meetings of the Standing Committee of the Council of Ministers and his office is consulted on a<lb/> day-to-day basis by the Socio-Economic Affairs Division, Department of the Prime Minister&apos;s<lb/> Chancellery 61 .<lb/></table>

			<p>The Legislative Council is the senior legal advisory body to the Prime Minister 62 . It advises on the<lb/> enactment of draft primary and secondary legislation and evaluates the condition of the law,<lb/> particularly in terms of alignment with the Constitution and EU law. Evaluation reports are<lb/> regularly issued 63 . However, in practice, the Legislative Council may be consulted by the Cabinet<lb/> Committee and the Cabinet only if a collective decision is taken to that effect 64 . Approximately<lb/> 60% of the draft Bills are submitted to it but its opinion does not bind the department.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, after the inter-ministerial amendment procedure, Bills are submitted to<lb/> the Legislative Council of the Government, which is a constituent part of the Office of the Prime<lb/> Minister. It addresses technical, legal issues, such as lack of conformity with the Constitution and<lb/> reviews drafts to improve their quality. The Secretariat of the Legislative Council drafts an opinion<lb/> on each Bill, which is prepared following discussion with the official in the Ministry responsible for<lb/> the Bill.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, from time to time, there is a two-day meeting, where the Legislative Council reviews<lb/> its work and the Chairman meets with officials who are involved in the process of drafting<lb/> legislation, and the Secretariat of the Council, to identify ways in which legislative drafting can be<lb/> improved. Close attention is also paid to the conformity of laws with the Constitution and the<lb/> general principles of law. The Institute for Approximation of Law screens the compatibility of Bills<lb/> with EU law.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Slovenia, all legislation must be submitted for review by the Government Office for Legislation<lb/> to examine it in terms of its conformity with the Constitution, general principles of Slovenian law,<lb/> the acquis communautaire, and its compliance with the style of Slovenian legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality Assurance – Tools<lb/></head>

			<p>In most countries, explanatory reports must be submitted to the reviewing bodies and the<lb/> parliament in order to enable them to carry out their quality assurance role. As a result, in some<lb/> countries, draft regulations may be returned to the drafting ministries where the information<lb/> provided by the supporting documents is not sufficient (Latvia,</p>

			<table>Slovenia).<lb/> The reports may be described differently in the various countries: policy documents, annotations,<lb/> covering letters, law concept papers, explanatory reports, and legal check lists. However, the<lb/> 59<lb/> OECD (2002), Reviews of Regulatory Reform, Poland – From transition to new regulatory challenges.<lb/> 60<lb/> OECD (2002), ibid.<lb/> 61<lb/> Goetz K.H., Zubek R. (2005), Law making in Poland: rules and patterns of legislation, Report commissioned by Ernst &amp;<lb/> Young Poland within the framework of the Ernst &amp; Young Better Government Programme, April 2005.<lb/> 62<lb/> K.H. Goetz, R. Zubek, ibid.<lb/> 63<lb/> OECD (2002), ibid.<lb/> 64<lb/> K.H. Goetz, R. Zubek, ibid.<lb/></table>

			<p>content of these reports is, in general in the NMS, quite similar and they usually include<lb/> information such as the justification, scope of the proposal and the certification that it complies<lb/> with EU law. Some reports may contain an assessment of the various impacts that the draft<lb/> regulation may have, including, very often, the financial impacts (Latvia, Slovak Republic, and<lb/> Slovenia). In theory, in all countries except Cyprus and Malta all proposals submitted to<lb/> government should be accompanied by an impact assessment but in practice the quality of these<lb/> varies substantially.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some countries, the requirement to support a draft regulation with an explanatory note does<lb/> not apply to all legislation. In Malta, the legal check list must be filled in only for secondary<lb/> legislation. In addition, some specific check lists or reports may be required in the case of primary<lb/> or secondary regulations transposing EU directives (Cyprus and Lithuania).<lb/></p>

			<p>In countries where policy-making and regulation drafting are clearly separated, there may be two<lb/> kinds of report, one policy paper and one explanatory report, as is the case in Estonia and<lb/> Latvia. However, in most countries, a single document accompanies the draft law from the<lb/> drafting stage to its presentation before the parliament.<lb/></p>

			<head>Material required for the information of the Attorney General in Cyprus<lb/></head>

			<p>The work undertaken in the Office of the Attorney General is facilitated by it getting good<lb/> instructions to draft or clear instructions as to what issues need attention. Its task is made easier<lb/> by the requirement that officials sending to it draft legislation must always send with the drafts<lb/> sufficient information to enable it to perform its functions effectively. This information includes:<lb/></p>

			<p>► Adequate information on the history of the problem, a detailed explanation of the<lb/> legislative proposal aimed to rectify (e.g., discussions that have taken place, ad hoc<lb/> committee proposals, judicial decisions etc.).<lb/> ► The main goal(s) of the legislative proposal, with a report on the necessity for any<lb/> possible reservations or transitional clauses.<lb/></p>

			<p>► The means with which the main goals of the legislation shall be accomplished (e.g., the<lb/> mechanisms anticipated to come into force, competencies and powers deemed<lb/> necessary to grant, etc.).<lb/> ► All known difficulties and ramifications (legal, social, administrative) that could possibly<lb/> be caused by the legislation, as well as the expected costs of its application publicly<lb/> and/or privately.<lb/></p>

			<head>Model Law Concept and Explanatory Letter in Estonia<lb/></head>

			<p>In Estonia, two documents are submitted at different stages of the rule making process to the<lb/> reviewing bodies. The Law Concept Paper is drafted at the stage of initiation of policy and the<lb/> explanatory letter is circulated at the stage when the legislation is drafted.<lb/></p>

			<p>At an early stage in the policy formulation process, a ministry proposing to introduce new<lb/> legislation must send the broad outline of the proposal, in the form of a Law Concept Paper, to<lb/> the Ministry of Justice for approval of the proposal in principle.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Model law concept and explanatory letter (Estonia)<lb/> The Law Concept Paper is based on a circular letter sent to all ministries indicating that draft<lb/> regulations for consideration by government should set out:<lb/> 1)<lb/> Description of the situation of the area.<lb/> 2)<lb/> Purpose of the proposed regulations.<lb/> 3)<lb/> Potential means to achieve the policy goals.<lb/> 4)<lb/> The scope of the law.<lb/> 5)<lb/> Impacts of the proposed regulations.<lb/> 6)<lb/> Financing.<lb/> 7)<lb/> Presumable time limit for preparing the draft law and the name and contacts of the<lb/> official responsible as well as the name and contacts of the official who has some legal<lb/> expertise.<lb/> In addition, a draft law must be accompanied by an explanatory letter.<lb/> The government regulation on technical rules also deals with the structure of the explanatory<lb/> letter of a draft law and requires that the explanatory letter shall include the following parts:<lb/> 1)<lb/> Introduction.<lb/> 2)<lb/> Purpose of the draft.<lb/> 3)<lb/> Content and comparative analysis of the draft.<lb/> 4)<lb/> Terminology of the draft law.<lb/> 5)<lb/> Conformity of the draft to the law of the European Union, effects of the regulation.<lb/> 6)<lb/> Expenses necessary for the implementation of the regulation, implementation acts of the<lb/> regulation, enforcement of the draft.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Annotations in Latvia<lb/></head>

			<p>In Latvia, draft laws and draft regulations which have a socio-economic impact or an impact on<lb/> the environment or on the state budget must be accompanied by a document called &apos;annotation&apos;<lb/> which summarises the impacts they may have. The annotation ensures that drafts submitted to<lb/> the State Secretaries&apos; meeting and, ultimately, to government are supported by research and<lb/> policy analysis. A description of the annotation process is set out in the box below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annotations (Latvia)<lb/></head>

			<p>Annotations are required by law and drafts submitted without the required degree of annotation<lb/> may be returned to the ministry by the State Chancellery for revision. Participants in the State<lb/> Secretaries&apos; meeting may also request that an annotation be prepared for a draft law in case<lb/> there is none.<lb/> The purpose of the annotation is to ensure evaluation of the socio-economic impact and fiscal<lb/> impact on the state budget and on the budgets of local governments of proposed policies or<lb/> regulations and to prevent adoption of conflicting regulatory enactments.<lb/> The annotation sets out:<lb/> ► The current situation and a description of the problem to be solved<lb/> ► A description of the main socio-economic indicators<lb/> ► Current legal regulations and necessary amendments<lb/> ► Reference to Government Declaration or a policy document authorising or requiring<lb/> proposal<lb/> ► Purpose of proposal and brief summary of it<lb/> ► Medium-term financial impact assessment<lb/> ► Reference to the EU legal instruments and international agreements<lb/> ► Communication with NGO`s relevant social partners<lb/> ► Institutional arrangements for the implementation of the draft regulation<lb/> A properly completed annotation should show an analysis of the impact on the development of<lb/> society and national economy, indicating possible changes in macroeconomic environment,<lb/> business environment and simplification of administrative procedures, social and environmental<lb/> situation and an analysis of the impact of the proposal on the observation of human rights and on<lb/> opportunities for men and women.<lb/> More specifically, the impact must be assessed on a range of factors, including:<lb/> ► The volume of the production of goods and services<lb/> ► The employment rate<lb/> ► The unemployment rate<lb/> ► Prices<lb/> ► Volume of exports<lb/> ► Competition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Legal Check List in Malta<lb/></head>

			<p>A legal notice check list has been in force since 2004. It applies, however, only to secondary<lb/> legislation. The function of the check list is to ensure that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are<lb/> informed about what secondary legislation is made and why it is needed. The check list covers<lb/> the following areas:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> General aspects (proposed legal notice title and Act in virtue of which it is being issued;<lb/> objectives, scope and compelling reasons for publication).<lb/> •<lb/> Drafting exercise (whether consultation with stakeholders and a regulatory impact<lb/> assessment were carried out).<lb/> •<lb/> Impact (impact on the private sector – envisaged new or increased burdens and<lb/> procedural or administrative impacts; impact on government – bearing on other<lb/> Ministries and entities and whether proposals impact on government priorities and<lb/> mainstreaming policies).<lb/> •<lb/> Outcomes (positive and negative outcomes; mitigation measures in case of negative<lb/> outcome).<lb/> •<lb/> Deadline for publication.<lb/></p>

			<head>Explanatory Statement in Poland<lb/></head>

			<p>Bills should be accompanied, when submitted to government and to parliament, with an<lb/> explanatory statement which must indicate, amongst other matters, the estimate of its social,<lb/> economic and financial effects, sources of finance, a statement of whether the Bill proposes to<lb/> impose a burden on the State Budget, and a declaration about the compliance of the Bill with the<lb/> law of the European Union. Bills presented by the Council of Ministers should be accompanied<lb/> by proposals of basic secondary legislation.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Following the Legislative Rules of the Government of the Slovak Republic and the<lb/> Methodological Instructions, draft Bills must be accompanied by:<lb/></figure>

			<p>•<lb/> A cover report containing a general justification for the legislation, the draft government<lb/> resolution, the draft resolution of the parliament, the actual draft regulation;<lb/> •<lb/> An explanatory report containing a justification for each section of the draft, details on<lb/> the compatibility of the law with the Constitution, other laws, international treaties; as far<lb/> as EC legislation is concerned, the report shall contain a specific clause explicitly<lb/> certifying the compatibility of the draft law with the law of the European Union; an<lb/> evaluation of the inter-ministerial comment procedure and the evaluation of the financial,<lb/> economic, environmental and social impacts of the draft law.<lb/></p>

			<head>Explanatory Letter in Slovenia<lb/></head>

			<p>The Rules of Procedure of the Government of Slovenia 65 require that all primary legislation be<lb/> accompanied by a covering letter which includes:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Data referring to identification and procedure for the consideration of the government<lb/> document.<lb/> •<lb/> Government decision proposal. If amendments to an implementing regulation are<lb/> proposed, the document shall include a proposal for the adoption of government<lb/> decision on determining the consolidated text.<lb/> •<lb/> Assurance of the proposer that the impact assessment of proposed government<lb/> decisions was carried out and that required inter-ministerial coordination and<lb/> consultation with the representatives of civil society was held; the impact assessment<lb/> shall be carried out in the area of public finance, compliance with the acquis, removal of<lb/> administrative barriers, as well as in the area of public administration, judiciary,<lb/> economy, environment and social situation of individuals. The proposer shall be<lb/> accountable for the accuracy of the part of the assurance under their competence.<lb/> •<lb/> The explanation of proposed decisions, including the explanation of effects of the<lb/> proposed measures and other data required for the quality decision-making of the<lb/> government, which shall be set by the Government Secretary General.<lb/> •<lb/> All elements prescribed by the National Assembly of Slovenia Rules of Procedure if the<lb/> draft is submitted to the National Assembly.<lb/> The Secretariat General issued an instruction 66 including in Annex a form which is to be filled in<lb/> by officials when drafting regulations and refers to all the elements of the explanatory report that<lb/> needs to accompany a draft text according to the Rules of Procedure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Specific Check List and Table for Transposing EU Legislation in Cyprus, Lithuania<lb/> and Malta<lb/></head>

			<p>In Lithuania, a table of concordance, provided with each draft to give effect to an EC Directive,<lb/> shows the derivation from the Article of the Directive and the destination to the article in the draft<lb/> legislation. This table also provides a degree of transparency which is of value to those who have<lb/> to interpret the legislation and to the European Commission who ensure that Member States<lb/> comply with their obligations.<lb/> In Cyprus, the laws transposing EC Directives follow the same path as ordinary laws. However,<lb/> the explanatory report sent to the Council of Ministers, together with these transposing laws as<lb/> well as their drafting procedures, differs to some extent from the one sent for ordinary laws.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report that accompanies a Bill to parliament is presented in accordance with a structured<lb/> questionnaire about the purpose of the transposition. This document includes a specific checklist<lb/> drafted by the Office of the Attorney General before the accession period and which the relevant<lb/> department is required to fill in on the basis of guidance issued by the Ministry of Finance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Check list that must accompany Bills submitted to Parliament (Cyprus)<lb/></head>

			<p>The checklist mentions the following elements:<lb/> ► Purpose – scope of new legislation<lb/> ► Reference – analysis of certain EU legislation<lb/> ► Timely commitments for adoption<lb/> ► Possibilities of derogation/acquis<lb/> ► Easiness/flexibility for any transitional arrangements<lb/> ► Competitive reference to existing legislation in Cyprus and to which extent affected by<lb/> new legislation<lb/> ► Capacity of the country to implement the provision re: staff mechanisms<lb/> ► Economic evaluation of the expected effect on citizens — organisation or other interests<lb/> of the country (general, economic, social or other of the proposed legislation)<lb/> ► Reference to meetings organised<lb/> ► Contacts with organizations — people interested<lb/> ► Direct course of implementation in the long-term<lb/> In addition, in the case of EC Directives, a timetable is also filled by the relevant department in<lb/> order to ensure a timely transposition; this mentions the following elements:<lb/> ► Legislation title<lb/> ► Relevant EC Directive<lb/> ► Transposition period<lb/> ► Department responsible<lb/> ► Date of completion of drafting<lb/> ► Legal vetting: date of submission – date of completion<lb/> ► Council of Ministers: date of submission – date of approval, date of signature by the<lb/> Minister (for Orders)<lb/> ► Parliament: date of submission — date of approval<lb/> ► Date of sending to the government — printing off<lb/> ► Reference of publication<lb/> In Malta, in addition to the check list prepared for use by Ministries in preparing secondary<lb/> legislation, the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) has drawn up a check list for<lb/> drafting secondary legislation implementing EU directives.<lb/> In accordance with the MEPA Guide, a transposition team is set up for each new item of<lb/> legislation, comprising the policy officials, MEPA&apos;s legal advisor, MEPA&apos;s EU Coordinator and<lb/> technical specialists from other agencies, as required. The team must then draw up a<lb/> transposition plan, laying down the timing and resources required in order to transpose the<lb/> legislation properly and on time. The project plan should identify who is involved in this process.<lb/> It sets out the objectives of the transposition and a precise time schedule for internal and public<lb/> consultation, as well as for post-consultation evaluation. It should also determine what risks and<lb/> difficulty may need to be faced during the process of transposition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Appropriate Number of Suitably Trained Personnel<lb/></head>

			<p>There is no rule on the ideal number of suitably trained personnel. The efficiency of a given<lb/> system may depend on the qualifications, experience and attitude of the officials and the way<lb/> they are managed. There are many variables in levels of ability, education and systems and<lb/> exact quantitative comparisons are difficult if not impossible.<lb/> In many countries, personnel with the level of competence to formulate policy and draft<lb/> legislation may be in demand in the private sector and are not inclined to stay in the public<lb/> sector. This was noticable, particularly, in <ref type="biblio">Latvia</ref> and the Slovak Republic. In most NMS, the<lb/> lack of skilled people available to draft legislation was mentioned by officials interviewed.<lb/> In Cyprus, the Office of the Attorney General has a staff of 80 [lawyers and support staff].<lb/> Ministries do not have a separate legal service but most of the people working in ministries have<lb/> a legal background. However, the levels of staffing in that Office were set to be improved.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the Legislative Council of the Government (LCG) is an independent<lb/> committee, consisting of civil servants, independent experts and academics, chaired by the<lb/> minister responsible for legislation. It is composed of some 25 members. Working groups<lb/> (namely for public law, private law and criminal law) are composed of 10 to 15 people who are<lb/> not full-time civil servants. The Members of the LCG are appointed at the discretion of the<lb/> government and should be eminent and well-respected public or private sector lawyers and not<lb/> actively involved in party politics.<lb/> In Hungary, at the Ministry of Justice, there are around 67 250 lawyers and, typically, two officials<lb/> are in charge of a draft regulation: one prepares the draft and the other supervises. However,<lb/> there are only 10 officials in the Law Department of the Ministry of Economy and Transport. This<lb/> number was reduced by 50% on the basis that there was no need for jurists in the ministry, and<lb/> the ministry&apos;s legal affairs issues could be contracted out to lawyers.<lb/> In Lithuania, the Legal Department of the Office of Government employs 9 lawyers to review all<lb/> proposals to government. Although 3 have over 15 years experience, this seems to be a light<lb/> capacity considering that only 4 days (7 for substantial proposals) are allowed to examine<lb/> legislative proposals, which suggests that either this requirement is interpreted flexibly or the staff<lb/> of the Office of the Government has a very heavy work load.<lb/> In Poland, the Government Legislation Centre employs 100 lawyers. Most of these lawyers have<lb/> at least a three-year drafting experience within a line ministry. However, the Legislative Council<lb/> is made up of 10 eminent lawyers, who perform their tasks within the Council, in addition to other<lb/> professional activities. Recently, as its membership was renewed, the staff of the Legislative<lb/> Council was reduced. In its recent composition, it has no support staff to assist its members.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In the Slovak Republic, for example, there is a Legislative Council composed of 18 members,<lb/> each chosen by the Chairman of the Council on the basis of their expertise across a wide range<lb/> 67<lb/></figure>

			<p>The word &apos;around&apos; was used in response to questions at interviews and is to reflect that, from time to time, officials are absent<lb/> for vacation, maternity leave and other reasons.<lb/> of legislative subjects. Members of the Council are not remunerated and continue to undertake<lb/> professional responsibilities in their respective fields. The Council is supported by a full-time<lb/> Secretariat, composed of 15 lawyers and some additional support staff. The Legislative Council<lb/> works under considerable time pressures and has to examine a substantial volume of legislation.<lb/> Some NMS (Latvia) have engaged in a process to increase staff numbers in this regard and to<lb/> reform the civil service so as to introduce more flexibility in departments responsible for law<lb/> drafting.<lb/> In Estonia, experts from other ministries or non-governmental bodies may be invited to<lb/> participate in the drafting process. The system demonstrates a high degree of flexibility which<lb/> helps compensate for weak capacity relative to larger public services. There is a list of experts<lb/> with a description of their competencies 68 , which enables working groups for impact assessments<lb/> to source knowledgeable experts.<lb/> In Malta, the Office of the Attorney General has a small number of lawyers, some of whom are<lb/> primarily engaged in reviewing and redrafting legislation. More staff are being recruited to that<lb/> Office and it is to be established as an agency to provide more flexibility as regards recruitment<lb/> and remuneration. 40 lawyers were working at the Ministry of Justice at the time of writing the<lb/> report, only two to three people were responsible for reviewing all legislation and one person was<lb/> responsible for translation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Need for Training in Drafting<lb/></head>

			<p>In most countries, officials responsible for drafting do not receive specific training in drafting. In<lb/> the common law world, it is said that it takes between 5 and 10 years to train a legislative drafter.<lb/> In the civil law world, all officials are expected, as part of their day-to-day duties, to be able to<lb/> draft legislation within their field of substantive competence. The activity is largely one of aptitude<lb/> and some individuals possess more of a gift for this type of activity than others. Even in the<lb/> common law world, with its elaborate network of professional drafting offices there is only a<lb/> limited number of institutions providing training in the subject.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all the NMS, efforts are being made to up-skill the public service. In Estonia 69 , the Legal<lb/> Terminology Committee has its own periodic publication. It contains articles on using language in<lb/> legal texts, on legal terminology, on translating legal texts as well as concrete proposals on how<lb/> to word certain rules. Although proposals of the Legal Terminology Committee are not<lb/> compulsory to law drafters, as they have no legal power, they are quite often considered.<lb/></p>

			<p>Work has begun in Cyprus on providing courses in legislative drafting for officials. In Latvia, law<lb/> drafting study courses are included in the curriculum of the law faculty of one university. The<lb/> School of Public Administration provides courses on impact assessment, policy-making and<lb/> strategic planning. In addition, the Legal Terminology Committee organises workshops and<lb/> seminars for law drafters to explain different linguistic questions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hungary and Poland</head>

			<p>have developed formal training in legislative drafting. In most NMS, drafts<lb/> are handled by officials, in accordance with their level of experience. The theory is that<lb/> experienced officials can draft at the level needed to produce high quality drafts. In many NMS,<lb/> however, the age profile of officials is very young. This is particularly striking in Estonia and<lb/> Latvia, where there has been a large influx of young people into the public service and an official<lb/> with 5 years experience would be regarded as very experienced.<lb/></p>

			<head>68<lb/></head>

			<p>For example, the list identifies officials by training: biologists, human geographers, engineers, economists, sociologits,<lb/> lawyers, public administration managers, etc.<lb/></p>

			<head>69<lb/></head>

			<p>The publication &quot; Õiguskeel &quot; (Legal language) is published five times a year.<lb/></p>

			<p>The lack of experience of the staff involved in drafting may be compensated for by the availability<lb/> of rules for drafting (Estonia) or by the publication of written criteria against which draft<lb/> regulations must be reviewed (Latvia). It would require a very detailed study to examine the<lb/> quality of legislative drafting in each Member State, taking account of linguistic differences and<lb/> different judicial approaches to legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> BETTER REGULATION TOOLS IN NMS<lb/> This section describes the tools used in NMS. Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA),<lb/> Consultation, Alternatives, Simplification, and Accessibility. It examines them from the point of<lb/> view of why they are used, how they are used (methodologies), who uses them (institutional<lb/> arrangements, where appropriate) and when they are used, in the NMS.<lb/> Impact Assessment — General<lb/></head>

			<p>Impact assessment 70 aims to facilitate the choice of the most efficient and effective regulatory<lb/> option by establishing a systematic and consistent framework for assessing the potential impacts<lb/> of government action. It ensures the formulation of evidence-based policies, while providing the<lb/> information necessary to make better regulatory decisions. Impact assessment also improves<lb/> transparency and accelerates culture change.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no single model for a good impact assessment programme. When designing an impact<lb/> assessment programme, it is necessary to take into account institutional, social, cultural and<lb/> legal contexts in the relevant country. An OECD study identified a number of good practices in<lb/> member countries which maximise the benefits to be gained from implementing an impact<lb/> assessment programme 71 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Impact assessment needs to be reviewed by a central body to ensure consistency across, and<lb/> within, ministries. The central body should add value by ensuring that ministries do not use<lb/> impact assessment to justify decisions taken and by facilitating dialogue between ministries and<lb/> resolving &apos;turf&apos; disputes between ministries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Impact assessment may be considered from two perspectives: as a tool to improve policy-making<lb/> and as specific methodology used to assess the impacts of given regulations. Impact<lb/> assessment should be part of an overall strategy on Better Regulation, as proposed in the<lb/> Mandelkern report 72 . Three common problems were identified by the Mandelkern report as<lb/> regards the implementation of a RIA policy. These are: practical difficulties, cultural resistance<lb/> and political pressures. The practical difficulties can be overcome by awareness raising through<lb/> 70<lb/></p>

			<p>Usually referred to as regulatory impact assessment, or RIA, but more easily recognised as impact assessment.<lb/></p>

			<head>71<lb/></head>

			<p>RIA best practices in OECD countries: Maximize political commitment to RIA; Allocate responsibilities carefully for RIA<lb/> programme elements; Train the regulators; Use a consistent but flexible analytical method; Develop and implement data<lb/> collection strategies; Target RIA efforts; Integrate RIA with the policy making process, beginning as early as possible;<lb/> Communicate the results; Involve the public extensively; Apply RIA to existing, as well as new, regulation.<lb/> 72<lb/></p>

			<p>The Mandelkern report suggested that there were 7 prerequisites for a successful RIA policy. These are worth repeating in<lb/> full as they still constitute a good basis for making a combined use of Better Regulation tools:<lb/></p>

			<p>񮽙 The RIA process needs to be an integral part of an overall strategy to improve the regulatory environment;<lb/></p>

			<p>񮽙 There must be high level political support for the concept of RIA and its practical application;<lb/></p>

			<p>񮽙 Preparation of a RIA should, wherever possible, be by the policy officials concerned and should start as soon as possible<lb/> in the policy development process and continue as a fundamental part of it;<lb/></p>

			<p>񮽙 The results of the assessment need to be informed by, and subject to, both informal and formal consultation with<lb/> interested parties and others;<lb/></p>

			<p>񮽙 This work is most effective when it is overseen by a specific structure dedicated to Better Regulation and is supported by<lb/> clear advice guidelines and training; and<lb/> 񮽙 Sufficient resources (in terms of quality and quantify) must be allocated to this structure.<lb/> training, appointing an adequate number of staff and identifying good sources of data for policy<lb/> analysis. The cultural and political challenges are closely related and both can be overcome by<lb/> political commitment and embedding the use of the tool into day-to-day regulatory management.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three common mistakes should be avoided in designing an impact assessment system 73 . Impact<lb/> assessment should not be used:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> As an ex post justification of the policy proposal.<lb/> •<lb/> To create another bureaucracy.<lb/> •<lb/> To define problems to fit into existing structures (some problems cut across traditional<lb/> ministerial boundaries and this fact needs to be recognised in the process).<lb/></p>

			<p>As far as the impact assessment methodology is concerned, consideration needs to be given as<lb/> to which issues need to be prioritised for impact assessment and the choices for assessment<lb/> include: economic impact, impact on the environment, impact on small businesses, and impact<lb/> on the public service itself.<lb/> Generally, the extent to which legislation may be enforced, or compliance with it secured, is not<lb/> considered by governments in advance of introducing new legislation. However, in the<lb/> Netherlands, the <ref type="table">Table of</ref> Eleven developed by the Dutch administration is a tool for thinking<lb/> about compliance, and for increasing the likelihood that regulations will be complied with through<lb/> an ex ante compliance assessment. It takes eleven aspects of a proposed regulation, each of<lb/> which will increase or decrease the likelihood of compliance. In considering how exactly to<lb/> phrase the regulation, and how to enforce and publicise it, the Table of Eleven is useful in<lb/> highlighting areas that are likely to reduce compliance, so that regulations can be made as<lb/> self-enforcing as possible.<lb/></p>

			<head>Table of Eleven<lb/> Developed in the Netherlands<lb/></head>

			<p>The eleven factors are<lb/> ► aspects of spontaneous compliance:<lb/> knowledge of the regulation<lb/> costs of compliance/benefits of non-compliance<lb/> degree of business and popular acceptance of the<lb/> regulation<lb/> loyalty and natural obedience of the regulated form<lb/> extent of informal monitoring<lb/> ► aspects of monitoring:<lb/> probability of report through informal channels<lb/> probability of inspection<lb/> probability of detection<lb/> probability of the inspector<lb/> ► aspects of sanctions<lb/> chance of sanctions<lb/> severity of sanctions<lb/> A further step in the development of an effective impact assessment policy is to undertake a<lb/> number of pilot impact assessment projects in some areas, selected on the basis of a screening<lb/> 73<lb/></p>

			<p>Many lessons have been learned over the last twenty years and are documented. Bibliography set out in Annex 5.<lb/> mechanism. Decisions need to be taken as to whether the same process should be applied to all<lb/> proposed policies or whether there should be a two-step approach of a broad brush stroke<lb/> impact for all proposed policies and a more detailed one for policies that will involve a substantial<lb/> impact.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ex post impact assessment<lb/></head>

			<p>The ex post assessments have much in common, in their approach, with the policy assessments<lb/> made ex ante. Ex post assessments may involve a consultation process in order to receive<lb/> feedback from stakeholders and make improvements, if necessary, to the legislation concerned.<lb/></p>

			<head>The European Commission Staff Working Paper on Impact Assessment and ex ante evaluation</head>

			<p>74<lb/> points out the need to set out ex ante and ex post evaluations. Few EU Member States have<lb/> procedures for the regular evaluation of the operation and the effectiveness of existing laws. In<lb/> some Member States 75 , ex post evaluations are carried out by scrutinising a random selection of<lb/> legislation on a quarterly basis. Ex post evaluations are usually carried out when general reviews<lb/> of existing legislation take place, for example in the context of the simplification programme. In<lb/> other cases, the time when the ex post evaluation takes place may be decided on when the new<lb/> regulation is being prepared and can, in appropriate circumstances, be included in the legal text.<lb/></p>

			<head>Typical questions addressed in ex post evaluation<lb/></head>

			<p>► Have the original objectives been achieved in quality, quantity and time, when measured<lb/> against the base of what would have happened without intervention?<lb/> ► To what extent has the intervention brought about the achievement of the objectives or<lb/> has it induced activity that would not otherwise have occurred?<lb/> ► Has implementation been affected, adversely or advantageously, by external factors?<lb/> ► Have any significant unexpected side effects resulted?<lb/> ► Have all the inputs required from the Government and the private sector been made as<lb/> planned?<lb/></p>

			<p>► Have any of the allocated resources been wasted or misused?<lb/> ► How efficient was the administration of the scheme?<lb/> ► Has the scheme led to any unfairness or disadvantage to any sector of the community?<lb/> ► Could a more cost-effective approach have been used?<lb/> ► What improvements could be made to the scheme that might make it more effective or<lb/> cost-efficient?<lb/> ► Overall is the scheme well-suited to meeting the desired objectives?<lb/></p>

			<head>Why is Impact Assessment Important?<lb/></head>

			<p>Impact assessment is possibly the most novel of the tools in that its use brings to bear economic<lb/> analysis and, used correctly, it may become a scientific driver for a more evidence-based<lb/> approach to policy-making. Impact assessment aids good decision making and makes<lb/> transparent the costs and benefits of different regulatory and non-regulatory options that may be<lb/> suggested by ministries. However, impact assessment is not a substitute for political<lb/> accountability.<lb/></p>

			<table>74<lb/> COM(2005)119 final, http://ec.europa.eu/research/future/pdf/comm_sec_2005_0430_1_en.pdf.<lb/> 75<lb/> E.g., the UK.<lb/> Impact assessment is not a new tool. It became used in the Office of Management and Budget (a<lb/> part of the Office of the President of the United States) in the nineteen seventies and has been<lb/> adopted by many countries since. Impact assessment is, increasingly, seen by governments and<lb/> the Institutions of the European Union to be an essential tool of governance.<lb/></table>

			<p>Conducting impact assessment may also contribute to improving compliance both ex ante,<lb/> through the use of a compliance assessment, and ex post, since ex post assessments may help<lb/> in identifying unanticipated regulatory effects with a view to amending regulations where their<lb/> original goals are not met.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact Assessment System in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>The European Commission has introduced a new Impact Assessment system in 2003. This<lb/> system is built partly on the experiences with its predecessor, the Business Impact Assessment<lb/></p>

			<table>(BIA). It was outlined in the Communication on Impact Assessment 76 , which was part of the<lb/> Better Regulation Action Plan 77 . Impact assessment was further improved in 2005 78 . The new<lb/> procedure aims to improve the quality of the Commission&apos;s policy proposals in terms of their<lb/> efficiency, effectiveness and coherency. It identifies alternative policy options and their likely<lb/> positive and negative impacts, with an equal focus placed on economic, environmental and social<lb/> effects, in line with the EU Sustainable Development Strategy 79 . In March 2006, the 2005 Impact<lb/> Assessment Guidelines were updated so that assessment of administrative costs is now a<lb/> compulsory and integrated part of impact assessments.<lb/> To reinforce quality control, the Commission announced in its Strategic Review Communication 80<lb/> the creation of an Impact Assessment Board. It is composed of high level Commission officials<lb/> from DGs ECFIN, ENV, EMPL and ENTR, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General. The Board<lb/> acts independently of the policy-making departments and reports directly to the President of the<lb/> Commission. It issues opinions on the quality of IAs. To assist its work the IAB may have<lb/> recourse to external expertise. It commenced meetings in December 2006, and issues several<lb/> opinions already.<lb/></table>

			<p>The Commission IA system as a whole was subjected to a comprehensive independent review<lb/> by external consultants during 2006, and the final report was delivered to the Commission<lb/> recently. It will be used to detect areas for improvement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact Assessment in NMS<lb/></head>

			<p>At the time of the assessments, Cyprus and Malta did not have a fully developed policy on<lb/> impact assessment, though the matter was under active consideration in both. The necessity for<lb/> impact assessment was understood and used in the context of environmental impact<lb/> assessments in both countries and for some large-scale projects involving substantial sums of<lb/> money. It was not in use as a tool to improve the quality of policy-making or the drafting of<lb/> legislation.</p>

			<table>Cyprus established a task force to address the issue and the Better Regulation Unit<lb/> in the Management Efficiency Unit in Malta began work which will lead to the introduction of<lb/> impact assessment.<lb/> All of the other NMS had adopted impact assessment in some form or another. However, a<lb/> number of NMS (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland and the Slovak Republic) had reached<lb/> 76<lb/> COM(2002)276 final, ibid.<lb/> 77<lb/> COM(2002)278 final, ibid.<lb/> 78<lb/> European Commission (2005), New Impact Assessment Guidelines June 2005, SEC(2005)791,<lb/> http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/SEC2005_791_IA%20guidelines_annexes.pdf.<lb/> 79<lb/> COM(2001)264 final, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0264en01.pdf.<lb/> 80<lb/> COM(2006) 689 final.<lb/> the stage where they recognised that impact assessment existed in form, rather than in<lb/> substance. In all NMS, other than Cyprus and Malta, impact assessment was required by law<lb/> for proposals to be submitted to government.<lb/></table>

			<head>Legal Basis<lb/></head>

			<p>In the</p>

			<figure>Czech Republic, the Government Rules of Procedure (GRP) 81 impose a requirement that<lb/> all policy proposals should include an analysis of the impacts on the business environment and<lb/> the impact on equal treatment of men and women. Similar legal arrangements are in place in<lb/> Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. In the absence of a central<lb/> control on their quality, these arrangements are generally ignored.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Estonia impact assessments were obligatory for all proposals for new legislation. Regulatory<lb/> impact assessments were included as part of explanatory memoranda for Bills from 1996<lb/> onwards. A ministry drafting legislation must, according to Rules of Government, prepare an<lb/> analysis of its potential impacts. Both the parliament (Riigikogu) and the government adhere to<lb/> technical rules on drafting, which include the necessity to examine a list of impacts that need to<lb/> be assessed when drafting legislation. In February 2005, a new rule came into operation under<lb/> which each minister and state secretary may give additional recommendations regarding the<lb/> methodology of regulatory impact assessment in their corresponding areas of competence.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Latvia, in 1998, the impact assessment system was introduced in the Rules of Procedure of<lb/> the Government. The detailed methodology of impact assessment is set out in a government<lb/> instruction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transparency of Impact Assessments<lb/></head>

			<p>In some NMS, impact assessments are published. For example in Latvia, before a regulation is<lb/> drafted, the need for the regulation is considered and the description of the current system must<lb/> be set out in the Concept Paper 82 . Draft laws in Estonia must be accompanied by an explanatory<lb/> letter. The explanatory letter is designed to oblige the drafter of a proposed law to explain the<lb/> meaning of the draft law in simple language. The inclusion of comparative analysis and impact<lb/> assessments in this letter is a useful device to explain why certain solutions were preferred.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methodologies<lb/></head>

			<p>Approaches to the methodology of impact assessment are different in all NMS that undertake<lb/> impact assessments. Two main trends may be observed: some NMS have guidelines or are<lb/> revising the existing guidelines; others leave the methodology to be determined by the ministry<lb/> undertaking the assessment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, guidelines for regulatory impact assessment were being developed<lb/> (2006) based on the UK and the new EU methodology. This work was scheduled to be<lb/> completed by the end 2006. Some training to explain the concept and introduce the EU<lb/> methodology was given to 50 civil servants by the Institute of State Administration (Central<lb/></p>

			<table>Training Unit).<lb/> In Hungary, since January 2006, a new procedure on the Methodology of Regulatory Impact<lb/> Assessment applied, based on a manual drawn up by the Department of Impact Analysis,<lb/> Deregulation and Registration of Law. It applies during the preparatory phase of drafting laws<lb/> and regulations. Measures laid down in the manual may be used in the course of preparing<lb/> legislative proposals, and may also be applied (with variations) to other administrative<lb/> organisations.<lb/> 81<lb/> Since 2001.<lb/> 82<lb/> Procedures for filling in annotations of draft regulatory enactments 18.09.2001.<lb/> In Latvia, a general approach to impact assessment in policy documents is set out in Policy<lb/> Planning Guidelines (2001), Regulatory impact assessment methodology is defined in the<lb/> Government Instruction entitled &quot; filling in the Annotation of draft legal acts &quot; 83 . There is also a<lb/> Manual on Impact Assessment methods which is used in policy planning and legal drafting. That<lb/> Manual was prepared by State Chancellery and published in 2005. It deals with the quantitative<lb/> methods to be used in impact assessments, such as cost-benefit analysis, cost effectiveness<lb/> analysis and risk analysis.<lb/> In Lithuania, a Manual on Regulatory Impact Assessment was drawn up. It recommends that<lb/> institutions dealing with EU legislation, or developing proposals that may have significant<lb/> economic or social impacts, should carry out RIA by employing different tools such as<lb/> cost-benefit analysis or other comprehensive studies.<lb/> In Poland, in order to increase the effectiveness of the RIA process, the Ministry of the Economy<lb/> prepared new RIA Guidelines which were adopted in October 2006. It is planned, after operating<lb/> the new guidelines for 12 months, to evaluate their effectiveness. Institutional arrangements for<lb/> RIA were implemented in 2006 in order to strengthen the RIA system, including placing<lb/> responsibility for the review of RIA in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister instead of the<lb/> Government Legislation Centre where it was until July 2006.<lb/></table>

			<p>The new guidelines clarify the key analytical steps to be taken in the undertaking of a RIA. The<lb/> Guidelines constitute a set of logical steps which structure the preparation of policy proposal from<lb/> identifying the problem, choosing objectives and main policy options, through comparing the<lb/> possible options, assessing cost and benefits of each option to finally recommending the best<lb/> solution.<lb/></p>

			<p>The emphasis in the revised Guidelines was put on:<lb/> •<lb/> Assessing the impacts in qualitative, quantitative and monetary terms where possible<lb/> and appropriate.<lb/> •<lb/> Assessing the impact on SMEs.<lb/> •<lb/> Carrying out wide consultation before proposing legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Slovak Republic provides a good example of how an impact assessment policy may be<lb/> undermined if there is no unified methodology to assess impacts. A study on the general quality<lb/> of the Annexes submitted to the Council of Ministers was conducted by the Ministry of Justice.<lb/> The following problems were noted:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Many Annexes were unclear, inaccurate, or contained incomplete data;<lb/> •<lb/> A large number of Annexes were not prepared in line with the rules for their preparation;<lb/> •<lb/> Some Annexes did not contain all of the relevant information;<lb/> •<lb/> In some cases, the documents submitted to the Council of Ministers did not contain an<lb/> Annex;<lb/> •<lb/> Very often, the author of the document or Bill did not submit the proposal for covering<lb/> the estimated costs;<lb/></p>

			<table>•<lb/> The second part of the Annex (impact on business and citizens) was almost always<lb/> prepared very generally and without any proper costs.<lb/> These problems were attributed, partly, to the lack of analytical capacities, and inadequate<lb/> education and training of staff in ministries. Officials preparing legislation would appear to have<lb/> 83<lb/> Instruction Nr. 4, 18.09.2001.<lb/> variable approaches to providing information and tend to focus on the need to accelerate the<lb/> legislative process and avoid conflicts with the Ministry of Finance.<lb/> The weakness in the process is to be addressed. The Council of Ministers took a decision in July<lb/> 2005 84 directing the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister of Social<lb/> Affairs, and the Minister of the Economy to draft unified methodologies for assessment in the<lb/> Annex on financial, economic, environmental, social and business environment impacts.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Slovenia, the Better Regulation Group 85 is responsible for developing an impact assessment<lb/> methodology. In addition, the Government Office for Legislation and the Official Gazette<lb/> department are co-operating to develop an e-portal 86 . It will enable its users to carry out an<lb/> impact assessment or check and verify their assessment results with the interested stakeholders.<lb/> In practice, through this portal, citizens will be able to comment on a draft law and the results of<lb/> the consultation process will be processed automatically and integrated into a pre-formatted<lb/> report.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional Arrangements<lb/></head>

			<p>In the</p>

			<table>Czech Republic, a Department of Regulatory Reform and Quality of Public Administration,<lb/> established after the transfer of the Better Regulation Unit from the Government Office to the<lb/> Ministry of the Interior in November 2006, ensures a help desk function and checks the quality of<lb/> the impact assessments carried out for all proposed regulation.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Estonia, the approach to impact assessment varies from ministry to ministry and there is no<lb/> central body to review its quality. For example, the Ministry of Social Affairs has, as part of its<lb/> process management initiatives, developed a legislative drafting procedure that involves both<lb/> public consultation (during the early stage of policy-making) and regulatory impact assessments.<lb/> The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment have undertaken similar initiatives.<lb/> Some individuals in some ministries are more committed to improving impact assessment than<lb/> others and a committee was established in the Ministry for the Environment to review and<lb/> improve its approach to impact assessment.<lb/> In Hungary, a Department of Impact Analysis, Deregulation and Registration of Law was<lb/> established but was never formally conferred with overall responsibility for reviewing the quality<lb/> of impact assessments. The Department was abolished in July 2006. However, the Law<lb/> Department of the Government Office, while not having the role of reviewing or carrying out<lb/> impact assessments centrally, may point out in its report to government the lack of such analysis<lb/> in its report to the government.<lb/></p>

			<p>Impact assessments are mandatory in Latvia for all policy proposals and draft legal Acts with a<lb/> socio-economic impact or an impact on the state budget. Impact assessments are reviewed in<lb/> the State Chancellery and in line ministries, according to their respective competencies. Impact<lb/> assessments that do not the required standard are returned to the ministry.<lb/></p>

			<head>What is Assessed?<lb/></head>

			<p>The table below provides an overview of a representative sample of impacts assessed.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some countries, a two-step approach is applied whereby an in-depth assessment is only<lb/> necessary for pieces of legislation that are expected to have an impact on the business<lb/> environment.<lb/></p>

In the case of major<lb/> regulations, there should be a quantitative<lb/> assessment. In the case of other regulations,<lb/> the assessment is limited to qualitative<lb/> analysis. The most common quantitative<lb/> method applied is cost-benefit analysis.<lb/> However, other methods include:<lb/></p>

			<head>Ex Post<lb/></head>

			<p>In Cyprus and Malta, responsibility for conducting ex post impact analysis of regulations and<lb/> policy implementation programmes rests in individual policy departments or special research<lb/> services of ministries. Some ministries have undertaken studies to evaluate the effectiveness of<lb/> policies using different methods.<lb/> In Estonia, responsibility for conducting ex post impact analysis of regulations and policy<lb/> implementation programmes rests also in individual policy departments or special research<lb/> services of ministries. There is no external review of policy implementation or the effectiveness of<lb/> regulations. For example, the Ministry of the Environment (Department of Forestry) ordered an ex<lb/> post impact assessment of the Forest Act in 1996.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other ministries have undertaken studies to evaluate the effectiveness of policies, including<lb/> aspects of income tax, social security, pension schemes, parent benefit, taxation and financing of<lb/> NGOs, regional development policy, ownership reform in rural areas and student benefits.<lb/> Reviews are conducted regulation by regulation as well as issue by issue.<lb/> Ex post assessments are undertaken using different methods; some concentrate more on case<lb/> law, some more on social aspects, much depends on the issue itself that is under evaluation.<lb/> Some policies are reviewed as part of the planning for budgets of subsequent years and this<lb/> activity may be seen reflected in the ministry&apos;s yearly activity plan. Representatives of target<lb/> groups and other interested parties (e.g. research centres, other ministries) are involved in<lb/> evaluation &amp; ex post impact assessment of existing regulations. For example, in March 2005, the<lb/> working group of the new Forest Act included all interested parties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consultation Generally<lb/></head>

			<p>Consultation may be defined as &apos;a structured public engagement which involves seeking,<lb/> receiving, analysing and responding to feedback from stakeholders.&apos; It involves defining the<lb/> purpose and subject of the consultation (policy initiative, regulatory change, legislative proposal).<lb/> In most countries, consultation is mainly conducted on primary legislation and very rarely on<lb/> secondary legislation. It also involves drawing up a consultation methodology, including criteria<lb/> for identifying stakeholders.<lb/> The potential for consultation is a function of the strength of civil society and of the procedures<lb/> used, so principles laid down for consultation need to take into account particular domestic<lb/> cultural and societal factors as well as the national institutional set up.<lb/> Some countries have adopted guidelines on consultation, thereby providing the necessary<lb/> political support for the consultation process within the Government system. The guidelines<lb/> should be flexible and take into account different levels of organisation by stakeholders. A<lb/> general time limit for consultations on draft laws should be set and compliance with the set of<lb/> principles should be reviewed in the centre of government. The consultation process should be<lb/> linked closely with the regulatory impact assessment process.<lb/></p>

			<p>The necessary elements seem to be the following:<lb/> •<lb/> Recommendations for how to select stakeholders to ensure a broad and useful input.<lb/> •<lb/> A minimum time for external consultation needs to be introduced.<lb/> •<lb/> Systems to ensure that the recommendations for selections and the minimum time have<lb/> been complied with.<lb/> •<lb/> Dissemination of best practices.<lb/></p>

			<p>A distinction needs to be drawn between consultation within the government at the stage of the<lb/> inter-ministerial comment procedure and consultation with the public in general which may be<lb/> conducted through various procedures. In this regard, three main types of consultation with the<lb/> public can be identified:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Consultation with established bodies, e.g., tripartite committees.<lb/> •<lb/> Consultation with ad hoc advisory groups.<lb/> •<lb/> Public notice published on the internet and submitted to public comment, which may<lb/> facilitate on-going consultations.<lb/></p>

			<head>Why Consult?<lb/></head>

			<p>The use of public consultation has different implications for the improvement of the regulatory<lb/> framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firstly, if it is undertaken in a timely and effective manner, consultation captures the collective<lb/> intelligence of a society. It is increasingly being used to collect empirical information for analytical<lb/> purposes, especially as a precondition for the move towards more analytically-based models of<lb/> decision-making processes (e.g., the use of impact assessments to evaluate the impact of<lb/> regulations). Thus, consultation is a cost-effective source of data, as well as a source of<lb/> information on issues such as the acceptability of various policies, which can be essential in<lb/> determining practicability and designing compliance and enforcement strategies. Thereby, a<lb/> consultation process is a valuable tool to improve the legitimacy and credibility of government<lb/> actions. This data and information may also, in some countries, be used when carrying out<lb/> regulatory impact assessments.<lb/> Secondly, consultation mechanisms are also being increasingly characterised by greater<lb/> openness and accessibility, particularly for smaller, less organised interests. This reflects a move<lb/> away from corporatist modes of governance toward more pluralistic approaches. Consultation is<lb/> inherent to transparent and effective governance.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, consultation is a partnership process that can improve the quality of legislation by<lb/> involving expertise in civil society.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consultation in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>The Commission has a long tradition of consulting interested parties on its policy and regulatory<lb/> proposals. In order to improve its consultation processes, the Commission adopted a set of<lb/></p>

			<table>&apos;General Principles and Minimum Standards for Consultation of Interested Parties&apos;&apos; 88 . The EU<lb/> highly values consultation with interested parties 89 , and the collection and use of expertise 90 ,<lb/> which are both an integral part of the process.<lb/> These principles and standards provide a framework for consulting civil society and stakeholders,<lb/> which ensures transparency and access to consultations, feedback to contributors and a<lb/> minimum reply time of 8 weeks. This action is linked to the impact assessment procedure and<lb/> will, as a first step, apply to those initiatives subject to impact assessments. Nevertheless, the<lb/> Commission&apos;s services are encouraged to apply those rules to any other consultations that they<lb/> intend to launch.<lb/> All consultations of special interest for businesses and professional organisations are accessible<lb/> through DG Enterprise and Industry&apos;s dedicated web page Enterprise and Industry DG in<lb/> Dialogue. DG Enterprise and Industry&apos;s consultations are also accessible through Your Voice in<lb/> Europe, the Commission&apos;s &apos;single access point&apos; for all its public consultations.<lb/></table>

			<head>Consultation in NMS<lb/> Legal Basis<lb/></head>

			<p>In</p>

			<figure>most NMS (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia),<lb/> consultation forms part of the policy of regulation making rules as a compulsory requirement. In<lb/> Lithuania, although public consultations are discretionary, some important laws such as the Law<lb/> on Public Administration and the Law on Local Self-Government provide for compulsory<lb/> consultation.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Methodology<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS have established different methods of conducting consultations. However, consultation<lb/> procedures are not standardised in any NMS and even vary from one ministry to another. In<lb/> addition, the type of consultation very often depends on the issue and its complexity, as well as<lb/> on the body or people consulted. These variations may undermine the credibility of consultation<lb/> exercises. The only factor in common is that none has a coherent written</p>

			<table>policy.<lb/> 88<lb/> COM(2002)704 final, ibid.<lb/> 89<lb/> COM (2002) 704 final, ibid.<lb/> 90<lb/> COM(2002)713 final, http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/comm_expertise_en.pdf.<lb/> In countries where civil society is more developed (Cyprus, Estonia, and Malta), consultation<lb/> processes are conducted at various stages of the regulation making process on the basis of an<lb/> agreed practice and rooted in a social dialogue and consensus tradition. However, this does not<lb/> exclude some form of guidelines or established procedures. In Latvia and Slovenia, where there<lb/> is little experience of consultation by Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), policies are being<lb/> developed to train representatives from NGOs in consultation methodologies.<lb/> In Cyprus and Malta, consultation exercises are not compulsory and there are no agreed<lb/> procedures to carry them out. However, some more established consultation procedures have<lb/> been adopted. The Code of Practice on Consultation of the Malta Environment and Planning<lb/> Authority, for example, describes the policy-making process and provides for guidelines on why<lb/> and how consultation should be conducted. In addition, for secondary legislation, the check list<lb/> requires that consultation take place.<lb/></table>

			<p>However, other than Cyprus and Malta, many of the countries assessed did not have a tradition<lb/> of consultation. Many officials we spoke to during the assessment expressed the view that<lb/> consultation was a burdensome process and that civil society had not the capacity to be<lb/> responsive to consultation procedures, though these officials fell short of taking the position that<lb/> the administration knows what is best for the citizen.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consultation with the Public<lb/></head>

			<p>In many NMS, recent legislation required that draft regulations be published on an official website<lb/> so that each citizen may comment on the draft. However, it is too early to judge what value is<lb/> added by the consultations.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Hungary, by virtue of section 19 of the Act 91 on the Protection of Personal Data and Open<lb/></head>

			<p>Access to Public Information, the state, local-government or other public organisations defined by<lb/> law is required to publish electronically or by other means all relevant data related to their<lb/> activities. The ministries post the texts of draft legislation on the public bulletin boards of the<lb/> so-called &apos;Green Spider&apos; network, based on the concept of &apos;open legislation&apos; whereby, according<lb/> to the Act on the Freedom of Electronic Information, draft laws are published on the internet,<lb/> together with a submission deadline for comments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Latvia, all proposals of importance are put on the website of the State Chancellery before their<lb/> consideration at the weekly meeting of the State Secretaries.<lb/> In Poland, following the Act on Lobbying, all government policies and initiatives should be<lb/> communicated to the public (especially, via internet sites of ministries) and that Act affirms the<lb/> right of everyone to comment on legislative proposals. In addition, certified professional lobbyists<lb/> communicate their comments on a given draft and can access the draft in the Bulletin for Public<lb/> Information. 92 However, much of the material on accessibility of legislation is included in the Law<lb/> on Access to Public Information.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, according to the Law on Free Access to Information, all pieces of<lb/> legislation, including guidelines and draft proposals for legal regulations, are made available on<lb/> government websites.<lb/> Some consultation practices are worth mentioning: In Estonia, the Web &apos;Talk along&apos; 93 initiative is<lb/> an innovative way of involving citizens in the formulation of policy and the drafting of legislation.<lb/> Everyone has the opportunity to register on the involvement Web and, through the website,<lb/></p>

			<table>notices can be sent by e-mail about consultations and changes in the legislative drafting work<lb/> 91<lb/> LXIII/1992 in force since June 1, 2005.<lb/> 92<lb/> Order No. 1/2006 (I. 7.) GKM on the Communication of the Ministry.<lb/> 93<lb/> www.mkm.ee/index.php?id=8252.<lb/> plan. In Latvia, a Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up in 2005 between Government<lb/> and NGOs and handbooks have been published for NGOs and training of officials in consultation<lb/> techniques. In addition, a representative of NGOs may attend the State Secretaries&apos; meetings<lb/> and the Cabinet of Ministers&apos; meetings as an observer and may suggest proposals.<lb/></table>

			<head>Consultation with Established Bodies and Stakeholders<lb/></head>

			<p>The consultation with business and civil society representatives in NMS is often conducted<lb/> through regular meetings of a committee comprising representatives from social organisations<lb/> and NGOs, as in Cyprus, Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland, or following more ad hoc initiatives,<lb/> or a combination of the two, as in the Slovak Republic. In any case, from the point of view of the<lb/> consulting party, it is not always easy to identify the relevant organisations or the persons in<lb/> organisations who are the most appropriate to consult with.<lb/> In Cyprus, depending on the issue and on the existing legislation, the examination of the<lb/> proposal by a committee such as, for example, the Labour Advisory Board or the Joint Staff<lb/> Committee may be required. The Joint Staff Committee is consulted on all issues concerned with<lb/> terms and conditions of civil servants and comprises interested parties from the private sector as<lb/> well as from the civil service.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the Legislative Rules enable a form of public consultation to take place.<lb/> However, the authority responsible for the preparation of the law has discretion as to whether<lb/> and how it will consult with bodies such as NGOs. In the case of labour, the Tripartite Council<lb/> (Government, Unions and Employers) must be consulted. In addition, following the recent<lb/> amendment to the Legislative Rule of Government, the Economic Chamber has become an<lb/> official participant in the inter-ministerial comment procedure and can send its comments to the<lb/> relevant ministry. Furthermore, the adoption of the</p>

			<table>Methodology of Public Consultations by the<lb/> Government is expected in 2007.<lb/> In Hungary, there are several government institutions designed to ensure stakeholder<lb/> involvement, e.g., the employment consent mechanism with the involvement of employers&apos; and<lb/> employees&apos; representation 94 . A typical consultation body is the National Environmental Council,<lb/> which meets once a week and has a secretariat run by the Ministry of the Environment.<lb/> In Lithuania, a Tripartite Council of Lithuania (Government, Business interests and trade unions)<lb/> was established in 1995 to deal with social, economic and labour issues.<lb/> In Poland, depending on the issue regulated, the government seeks the opinion of established<lb/> bodies, including:<lb/> •<lb/> The Joint Committee of the Central Government and Territorial Government, in each<lb/> case if the draft concerns operations of the territorial government.<lb/> •<lb/> The Tripartite Committee for Social and Economic Affairs composed of representatives<lb/> of employees, employers and central government.<lb/> •<lb/> The Copyright Committee.<lb/> •<lb/> Sectoral regulators.<lb/> In the Slovak Republic, many ministries have advisory bodies which are consulted on major<lb/> new proposals. The Minister of the Economy established a Business Environment Board,<lb/> comprising representatives of the Slovak Chamber of Industry and other business associations.<lb/> Bills and policy proposals relating to economic and social issues are discussed within the<lb/> framework of the Council of Social and Economic Agreement. In addition, in many cases, an ad<lb/> 94<lb/> Z. Kovacsy (2005), The Occurrence and Quality of Information on Impact Assessment in Proposals to the Government on<lb/> Draft Acts in Hungary.<lb/> hoc advisory committee or a working group of civil servants and experts is established. Extensive<lb/> consultation with non-governmental institutions (e.g., the Association of Slovak Towns and<lb/> Municipalities, the Union of Agricultural Cooperatives of Slovakia) is also organised.<lb/></table>

			<head>NMS: Lessons on Taking Results of Consultation into Account<lb/></head>

			<p>Whatever the consultation procedure may be, it remains formal unless a systematic policy to<lb/> assess the comments provided by the public, and take into account the relevant ones, is applied.<lb/> In Estonia, the Government estimates that about 5% of the amendments proposed within the<lb/> framework of the web talk along process are accepted.<lb/></p>

			<head>Latvia</head>

			<p>has developed several procedures to ensure that the opinion of civil society is reflected in<lb/> its regulations. The first stage is the publication or announcement of the draft. After publication<lb/> comments made are collected and, if necessary, meetings are held to review the comments, a<lb/> summary of all ministry proposals, including arguments for accepting or rejecting each proposal,<lb/> is prepared and accompanies the draft document when it is returned to the meeting of the State<lb/> Secretaries for approval.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, an NGO with an interest in issues to be discussed at the Cabinet of Ministers meeting<lb/> can apply to the Director of the State Chancellery to attend the Cabinet of Ministers&apos; meeting. In<lb/> exceptional circumstances, the NGO may be given the opportunity, at the discretion of the Prime<lb/> Minister, to make a statement at the meeting. A representative of NGOs attending a State<lb/> Secretaries&apos; meeting may submit views to State Secretaries and reasons must be given if they<lb/> are not taken into account.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Poland, according to the Rules of Procedure of the Council of Ministers and the Standing<lb/> Orders of the Sejm 95</head>

			<p>the results of public consultations conducted for a specific regulation must<lb/> be set out in the corresponding RIA. In addition, a number of ministries have set up internal<lb/> procedures to handle public comments. For example, comments made by the public on a<lb/> regulation drafted by the legal department of the Ministry of Justice are sent to the Codification<lb/> Committee for civil law or the Codification Committee for criminal law, which decides whether the<lb/> remarks are justified and need to be inserted into the draft.<lb/> However, in practice, RIAs rarely contain the result of the consultations conducted; this<lb/> information is replaced by a commitment added to the RIA text according to which &quot; the results of<lb/> the consultation will be included later &quot; . When stakeholders comment on a draft regulation, they<lb/> do not systematically receive feedback from ministries.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, where 500 or more people comment on a proposal their views must be<lb/> considered. If the proposal is not accepted by the government, it must give reasons to the<lb/> citizens who presented the proposals.<lb/></p>

			<p>It may sometimes be difficult to combine all the comments made by the public and various<lb/> stakeholders in a consultation process. Submissions to the process may be contradictory.<lb/> In Slovenia, a pilot project was carried out on the e-archiving law using the eSodelovanje portal:<lb/> 86% of the participants stated they would participate again via the portal and 75% of all<lb/> comments received were incorporated in the final version of the draft law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Assessing the relevance and whether the comments are representative of a wide range of views<lb/> is not easy for any country, nor is it easy to avoid the risk of consultation fatigue.<lb/></p>

			<head>Alternatives to Traditional Regulations — Generally<lb/></head>

			<table>Alternatives to traditional &apos;command and control legislation come in different forms. They include:<lb/> 95<lb/> Article 34.3 of the Rules of Procedure.<lb/> •<lb/> More flexible, less prescriptive forms of traditional regulation, performance-based and<lb/> incentive regulation allowing the regulated to develop their own approach to achieving<lb/> the desired outcomes; this maximizes flexibility and innovation while achieving the<lb/> desired objectives. Examples include compliance with occupational health and safety<lb/> requirements, environmental emission requirements and price regulation of firms with<lb/> monopoly power.<lb/> •<lb/> Co-regulation and self-regulation, such as codes of conduct, for which the industry itself<lb/> is responsible for enforcing.<lb/> •<lb/> Incentive and market-based instruments: taxes and subsidies (to align private and social<lb/> objectives more closely; pro-competitive reforms (removal of regulation and restrictions<lb/> that inhibit market operation); creating markets (tradable permits, periodic tendering for<lb/> service provision),<lb/> •<lb/> Information approach: education and persuasion are used to achieve the community&apos;s<lb/> objectives; government provided information; reporting requirements; advertising<lb/> campaigns.<lb/> •<lb/> No specific action, i.e., the option to do nothing.<lb/></table>

			<p>The use of alternatives to traditional regulations in a given country reflects the extent to which a<lb/> government addresses the question &apos;is regulation the best way to achieve a policy outcome?&apos;<lb/> Experience and knowledge of alternatives is continuing to develop but their use is very context<lb/> specific and, arguably, the most effective approach may be to have a range of tools brought to<lb/> bear on a policy problem with &apos;command and control&apos; legislation only being brought to bear where<lb/> alternatives have failed 96 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The potential to use such policy options is a function of a range of factors, including respect for<lb/> the rule of law, political stability, lack of corruption and a confidence that results can be achieved<lb/> without the ultimate sanction of a fine or imprisonment. Most OECD reports on Regulatory<lb/> Reform recommend that policy makers should give due attention, wherever possible, to the use<lb/> of alternatives to traditional &apos;command and control&apos; regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Why Use Alternatives to Regulations?<lb/></head>

			<p>Many disadvantages and problems arise from the use of a &apos;command and control&apos; approach,<lb/> such as regulatory failure, lack of flexibility and lack of adequate resources to enforce or secure<lb/> adequate compliance. In practice, in many situations, there may be a range of options other than<lb/> traditional &apos;command and control&apos; regulation available to achieve the government&apos;s policy<lb/> objectives.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although there may be considerable scepticism among policy makers and the public regarding<lb/> the use of alternative instruments, it is widely accepted that traditional regulation is not always<lb/> the most effective policy tool to ensure enforcement of, and compliance with, a policy and that<lb/> alternatives to traditional regulations should be considered more systematically.<lb/></p>

			<head>Alternatives to Traditional Regulations in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>The Commission&apos;s revised impact assessment guidelines require that all non-legislative options,<lb/> including the &apos;do nothing&apos; option are given equal consideration during the impact assessment<lb/> process. The European Commission accepts the principle that early and effective consideration<lb/> should always be given to alternative approaches to classic regulation, to make greater use of<lb/> alternatives to traditional legislation without undermining the provisions of the Treaty or the<lb/> prerogatives of the legislator. It suggests that certain policy objectives can be achieved with the<lb/> 96<lb/></p>

			<table>Working Party on Regulatory Management and Reform (OECD) GOV/PGC/REG<lb/> (2006) 9.<lb/> use of alternative regulations, such as New Approach Directives, co-regulation, self-regulation,<lb/> social partners&apos; agreements, market-based instruments, recommendations, and information or<lb/> guidance.<lb/> This approach was strengthened by the 2003 Inter-institutional Agreement on Better<lb/> Law-making 97 which encourages the use of alternatives to regulation.<lb/> Alternatives to Traditional Regulations in NMS<lb/> All NMS had used one or more alternatives at different times, though most officials interviewed in<lb/> Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia were not familiar<lb/> with the potential to use alternatives as a policy option and a &apos;command and control&apos; mentality<lb/> prevails.<lb/> Alternatives to regulations may take various forms, such as educational campaigns. In all<lb/> Member States there was an awareness of educational campaigns in respect of issues such as<lb/> software piracy. Codes of conduct are used in Cyprus and Lithuania in a number of fields,<lb/> notably in regulating professions such as lawyers.<lb/></table>

			<p>Estonian officials were also keen to mention that their response was not automatically to<lb/> regulate but to find the most efficient and effective means to achieve policy results.<lb/> In Malta, although not required, a number of entities have adopted a policy of assessing<lb/> alternative policy instruments prior to instituting new policy actions. These include, amongst<lb/> others, the Treasury, Customs Division, the Ministry for Family and Social Solidarity and the<lb/> Broadcasting Authority.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Poland, the Methodological Foundations of RIA and the newly adopted RIA Guidelines<lb/></head>

			<p>encourage the identification of alternative options to choose the best solution. However, as these<lb/> RIA guidelines were only introduced in October 2006, it is too soon to evaluate their<lb/> effectiveness.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplification Generally<lb/> Why is Simplification Needed?<lb/></head>

			<p>A priority in any simplification programme is the requirement to ensure that all written<lb/> communications between government and the citizen, including laws, are as simple as the<lb/> subject matter permits. Lack of clarity of language or difficulties in accessing legislation reduces<lb/> respect for the law and may contribute to regulatory failures. Accessibility of regulations is as an<lb/> essential element of a transparent and open system of democratic governance. The principle of<lb/> accessibility may require a particular effort of communication on the part of the public authorities<lb/> involved, for example, in some cases information needs to be targeted at those persons who,<lb/> because of their situation, have difficulty in asserting their rights.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second aspect of simplification is that it is a means to reduce the administrative burden.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Member States of the EU are becoming more aware of the costs of administrative burdens and<lb/> the need to make regulatory requirements as simple as possible. In an age when investors<lb/> compare administrative burdens between countries when making investment decisions, no<lb/> country can fail to appreciate the costs of administrative burdens or fail to take steps to simplify<lb/> regulations.<lb/> 97<lb/> COM(2003)770, http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/com2005_0098en01.pdf.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Beyond the general efforts undertaken in OECD countries to keep their regulations up to date in<lb/> order to maintain their competitiveness, specific grounds for legislation review in the NMS studied<lb/> may be found in two additional reasons.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some cases a substantial review of the body of law may be undertaken in the period<lb/> immediately following the transition from one regime to another. It was the case in the period<lb/> immediately following the communist period in most Central and Eastern European countries. In<lb/> some countries such a review does not take place as constitutional arrangements are made to<lb/> carry over certain laws from the previous regime.<lb/></p>

			<figure>When Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960, the Constitution provided for<lb/> continuation of English common law. As a result, many laws remain in force even though they<lb/> are in English and need to be translated into Greek.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Secondly, a large volume of regulations has been added to the stock as a result of the adoption<lb/> of the acquis communautaire. Nevertheless, the hectic pace of law making, with frequent<lb/> amendments, means that many texts are difficult to read. There is a need to review the stock of<lb/> regulation from the point of view of coherence. In most countries studied concern was expressed<lb/> about the quality of the transposition process for the acquis communautaire.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplification in the EU<lb/></head>

			<p>The Mandelkern Report recommended that simplification should become a general policy in the<lb/> behaviour of Member States and EU Institutions. This has involved the establishment of a rolling<lb/> and targeted &apos;SimpReg&apos; (SR) programme. Its remit extended to regulation beyond the Internal<lb/> Market and to regulation that impacts on citizens and on public bodies charged with<lb/> implementing it, as well as on business, thus covering the entire field of European regulation.<lb/> This work builds on earlier initiatives whereby the Institutions of the European Union adopted a<lb/> policy on guidance for drafting legislation, contained in the Inter-Institutional Agreement of<lb/> December 1998, relating to the quality of drafting of Community legislation. They ensured the<lb/> guidelines were applied by restructuring their internal organisation, insofar as they found it<lb/> necessary to do so. 98<lb/></p>

			<p>These earlier initiatives led to a programme of consolidation which involved the Publications<lb/> Office of the EU in an exercise to integrate the basic instruments of Community legislation, their<lb/> amendments and corrections, in single, non-official documents. These documents aim to provide<lb/> more transparency and easier access to EU Law. Several legal texts, initially and officially<lb/> published in different issues of the &apos;Official Journal of the European Communities&apos; are combined<lb/> as a &apos;consolidated family&apos; in one easy-to-read document 99 .<lb/> The Commission has a three-fold approach to simplification of form:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Repeal of regulations that are no longer of practical utility.<lb/> •<lb/> Codification, which is a reframing of regulations that have been amended excessively,<lb/> so that they may be more easily read but leaving the content unchanged.<lb/> •<lb/> Recasting (the process of redrafting, so that regulations may be more easily read<lb/> through revised drafting of particularly complex measures, and changes where<lb/> necessary to make the regulations more effective).<lb/></p>

			<figure>This exercise builds on an earlier exercise where the Commission had asked Member States,<lb/> businesses and citizens to tell it where red tape and over-regulation could be cut.<lb/> 98<lb/> Declaration 39, ibid., note 8.<lb/> 99<lb/> See http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/information/help/help-consleg.html for a full account of the process and access to<lb/> consolidations.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Repeal of Regulations that are no Longer of Practical Utility<lb/></head>

			<p>The Institutions of the EU are committed to a programme of repeal, i.e., a programme to remove<lb/> spent regulations or regulations that are no longer of practical utility or unused legislation from<lb/> the acquis. This work is undertaken in parallel with recasting work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Codification<lb/></head>

			<p>Codification work is also taking place in the Institutions of the EU. Codification contributes greatly<lb/> to the reduction in volume of Community legislation. To codify means to assemble an original<lb/> legal Act, plus all subsequent modifying Acts, in one new legal text.<lb/></p>

			<head>Recasting<lb/></head>

			<p>This is the task of revising the form and structure of legislation where frequent or substantial<lb/> amendment renders its contents difficult to follow and changes in policy require a review of the<lb/> whole area of legislation concerned.<lb/></p>

			<head>The 2005 Communication on Simplification<lb/></head>

			<p>The Commission&apos;s Better Regulation efforts focus on simplifying and updating the existing body<lb/> of EU legislation. The Commission launched a new phase, including a work programme. In its<lb/> Communication entitled: A Strategy for the Simplification of the Regulatory Environment 100 , the<lb/> review of the acquis communautaire has become a continuous and systematic process enabling<lb/> the legislator to revise legislation, taking all legitimate private sector and public interests into<lb/> account. This encompasses:<lb/> •<lb/> A rolling programme anchored in stakeholders&apos; practical experience.<lb/> •<lb/> An approach based on continuous in-depth sectoral assessment.<lb/> Following a broad consultation of Member States and stakeholders, the Commission proposes to<lb/> repeal, codify, recast or modify 222 basic pieces of legislation (now regrouped into 100) in the<lb/> next 3 years. The programme will be regularly updated. It has started with the most heavily<lb/> regulated sectors such as cars, waste and construction. Other sectors such as foodstuffs,<lb/> cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or services will follow.<lb/></p>

			<head>The 2006 Strategic Review<lb/></head>

			<p>The Strategic Review of Better Regulation in the EU includes a section on simplification.<lb/> Complimentarily, a Commission Working Document reports for the first time the progress<lb/> achieved since the launch of the strategy in</p>

			<table>October 2005 and presents new developments<lb/> towards further streamlining of the regulatory environment. In this context, 43 new initiatives will<lb/> enhance the simplification rolling programme for the period 2006-2009. For 2007, 58<lb/> simplification initiatives are planned.<lb/></table>

			<head>Screening and Withdrawal Exercise<lb/></head>

			<p>In parallel, the Commission set up a screening exercise targeting the flow of proposals still<lb/> pending before the legislator. After screening 183 proposals for EU laws pending at the<lb/> European Parliament and Council, the Commission selected 67 proposals pending, which were<lb/> legally withdrawn when the list of proposals was published in the</p>

			<table>Official Journal on 17 March<lb/> 2006. These proposals were withdrawn because some were inconsistent with the objectives of<lb/> the new &apos;Partnership for Growth and Jobs&apos; or did not meet Better Regulation standards. Others<lb/> were not advancing in the legislative process, or were simply outdated.<lb/> 100<lb/> COM(2005)535 final, ibid.<lb/> A new screening exercise was organised to complete the 2005 one: 79 proposals pending<lb/> adopted by the Commission between 1 January 2004 and 21 November 2004 (end of term of the<lb/> previous Commission) have been examined using the same criteria as for the 2005 screening.<lb/> Final results were announced in the Strategic Review Communication. The Commission informed<lb/> Parliament and Council as required, providing a justification for withdrawal for ten proposals in<lb/> total 101 . As a reasonable time elapsed without any reactions from their part, the list of withdrawals<lb/> was published in the Official Journal of 22 March 2007.<lb/></table>

			<head>Measuring Administrative Costs<lb/></head>

			<p>The Standard Cost Model (SCM) was designed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance for the purpose<lb/> of quantification of administrative burden caused by a particular regulation or a set of legal<lb/> standards, within the remit of a particular authority, during a specified time period, and for the<lb/> purpose of enabling comparability between regulations and departments. In order to meet the<lb/> administrative burden caused by the relevant information obligation imposed on business by the<lb/> State through regulation, businesses are required to perform a sequence of activities. A similar<lb/> model was developed in Denmark:<lb/></p>

			<figure>The cost of meeting the information obligation = the sum of the costs of all activities<lb/> necessary to meet the obligation.<lb/> The overall administrative burden following from regulation = the sum of the costs<lb/> incurred to meet all information obligations following from such regulation.<lb/> The cost P of performing an activity can be calculated as follows: P = tariff * time 102 .<lb/> The number Q of activities carried out during a given period is calculated as follows:<lb/> Q = number of businesses * frequency 103 .<lb/></figure>

			<head>Administrative Costs (EU)<lb/></head>

			<p>The</p>

			<figure>Commission issued a Communication on 21 October 2005 outlining a common methodology<lb/> to measure administrative costs in EU proposals.<lb/> More recently, the Commission Working Document on Administrative Costs, adopted on 14<lb/> November 2006, presents a broad strategy towards the reduction of administrative burdens,<lb/> using some results of the pilot project. This pilot identifies policy areas that are most responsible<lb/> for creating administrative burdens, by carrying out a cross-country comparison of the Member<lb/> States that have already done a baseline measurement.<lb/> An Action Programme, presented on 24 January 2007, demonstrates in concrete terms the way<lb/> in which the Commission intends to work with Member States to cut administrative burdens on<lb/> businesses by a quarter by 2012. The Programme focuses on information obligations in thirteen<lb/> selected priority areas including company law, employment relations, taxation/VAT, statistics,<lb/> agriculture and transport. The Action Programme also includes a first series of &apos;fast track actions&apos;<lb/> where significant benefits could be generated through relatively minor changes in the underlying<lb/> legislation. The measures could reduce the burdens on businesses by 1.3 billion euro.<lb/> 101<lb/> Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005 on relations between the EP and the Commission (paragraph 32).<lb/> 102<lb/> There exist two types of tariff – internal and external. The internal tariff is comprised of the unit costs per worker performing<lb/> the relevant activity within the business (hourly payroll costs + additional expenses) and the cost of materials. The external<lb/> tariff means, for instance, the hourly rate for the work of an external expert of organisation fulfilling the information<lb/> requirement on behalf of the relevant business. Time means the number of time units (hours) taken to carry out the required<lb/> activity. The required time may be determined by interviewing employers and employees.<lb/> 103<lb/></figure>

			<p>The number of businesses relates to businesses affected by the regulation, which are thus required to carry out the activity in<lb/> question pursuant to the regulation and the ensuing information obligation. Frequency indicates how many times one<lb/> business carries out the activity in a year.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Commission intends to tackle administrative burden, especially for small businesses, by<lb/> simplifying, for example, cumbersome statistics. However, significant results can only be<lb/> achieved if the European Parliament and Council as co-legislators support it and work to develop<lb/> this support is undertaken.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should also be noted that much EC legislation is to be found in Directives which require<lb/> Member States to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result.<lb/> Consequentially, many administrative burdens are imposed by Member States. A large duty falls,<lb/> therefore, on Member States to ensure that their administrative procedures are as efficient and<lb/> least burdensome as possible in accordance with the complexity and the risks associated with<lb/> particular legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplification NMS<lb/> Action Plans<lb/></head>

			<p>Most of the NMS have recognised the need for simplifying procedures to enhance the<lb/> competitiveness of their economy. This concern is reflected in governmental statements and<lb/> reform programmes relating to the Better Regulation agenda.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In the Czech Republic, the government adopted an Action Plan of Reducing Administrative<lb/> Burden on Businesses in April 2005, as well as a Methodology of Measurement of Administrative<lb/> Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost Model. A baseline measurement of administrative<lb/> burden imposed on businesses was then conducted and completed by December 2005. The<lb/> results of the measurements undertaken by particular ministries and central state administration<lb/> authorities were summarised in the report Analysis of Administrative Burden on Businesses<lb/> published in 2006. The results were used to prepare the proposal for the next phase of the<lb/> process, which should be submitted for the government&apos;s approval in 2007. It is envisaged that<lb/> mandatory, ex ante administrative burden assessment will be introduced.<lb/> In 2006, the Ministry of Justice in Estonia published an action plan to simplify a large number of<lb/> areas that affect businesses. It includes:<lb/> •<lb/> Simplification of company law.<lb/> •<lb/> Proposals to improve the quality of notaries.<lb/> •<lb/> Reforms of labour law.<lb/> •<lb/> A proposal concerning cost-based fees.<lb/> •<lb/> Improvements in planning and construction laws.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The most important components of the comprehensive programme to rationalise governmental<lb/> administration up to 2006 were: elimination of superfluous or parallel responsibilities of ministries<lb/> and state authorities, internal rationalisation of ministerial functioning and simplification of the<lb/> vertical structure of authorities. A Commissioner was appointed by the government for the<lb/> rationalisation of governmental administration.<lb/> The Programme of <ref type="biblio">Government (2006)</ref> renewed the commitment of the government to prioritise<lb/> the simplification of certain laws and to take steps to simplify the business regulatory<lb/> environment. It has set a number of goals, including that of simplifying the taxation system for<lb/> small companies, given the importance of SMEs for the Hungarian economy.<lb/> In Latvia, an annual action plan for improving the business environment has been adopted by<lb/> the government since 1999 and is regularly revised. The Latvian Investment and Development<lb/> Agency (LIDA) regularly commissions surveys and reports on the state of the business<lb/> environment to measure the extent to which the implementation of the action plan was successful<lb/> in this regard and to identify new priority areas for reforms. 104 In addition, the operational<lb/> programme Human resources and Employment contains provisions designed to develop projects<lb/> relating to the reduction of administrative burdens for citizens and entrepreneurs.<lb/></p>

			<head>In Lithuania, the Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategy for the Public Administration<lb/> Development up to 2010</head>

			<p>included a number of actions aimed at simplification of proposed and<lb/> existing regulations such as:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Preparing a manual that will be the basis for estimation and assessment of<lb/> administrative costs for businesses. The objective of this action is to determine the<lb/> concept of administrative costs and to define methods of assessment of administrative<lb/> costs for businesses.<lb/> •<lb/> Reconsidering legal regulation of different business areas in order to reduce<lb/> administrative burdens and simplify legal regulation for business.<lb/> A further initiative to reduce administrative burdens was the establishment of a Working Group by<lb/> the Prime Minister 105 to analyse the functions of institutions inspecting businesses and to put<lb/> forward a proposal for improving these functions. The Working Group presented its report, along<lb/> with an action plan, in 2004 and follow up action is underway.<lb/> In Slovenia, the Programme for the reduction of administrative burden for the year 2006<lb/> consisted of 34 measures. Each ministry submitted to the Ministry for Public Administration a<lb/> series of proposals for simplification with an explanatory comment in each and a timetable for the<lb/> implementation of the proposed simplification or reduction of administrative burdens. The<lb/> explanatory comment stated whether or not it would be necessary to amend legislation to<lb/> achieve the desired result. Among the 34 measures are the reduction of administrative delays,<lb/> extension of the &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; project for limited companies 106 , reduction of the number of<lb/> licences necessary for crafts 107 , simplification of the permission acquisition procedure for<lb/> planning permission for new buildings, simplification of rights on parent custody and easier<lb/> access to public procurement by SMEs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Measuring Administrative Costs — NMS<lb/></head>

			<p>In most of the NMS, there is no procedure to measure administrative costs or to collect<lb/> quantitative data on the various impacts regulations may have on businesses and citizens.<lb/> Arguably, the lack of a measurement of administrative costs or a baseline by which to make<lb/> comparisons weakens impact assessments undertaken for proposed legislation that will impose<lb/> a burden and it undermines the potential to conduct ex post assessment and ex post reviews of<lb/> regulations.<lb/></p>

			<p>The need to measure administrative costs is under consideration in many countries and, for<lb/> example, in Lithuania, there is an acceptance amongst officials that the lack of substantive<lb/> indicators prevents policy makers from determining whether planned outcomes are delivered<lb/> effectively.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The Czech Republic, Poland and the Slovak Republic have launched pilot projects or have<lb/> undertaken surveys in order to measure administrative costs and assess how friendly the<lb/> business regulatory framework is. The quality of the work varies, in accordance with the<lb/> enthusiasm of the officials.<lb/> In Cyprus, a number of surveys have been undertaken on the initiative of either the Public<lb/> Administration or Personnel Department of the Ministry of Finance, or the relevant department or<lb/> service, for the reduction of red tape. Cyprus is recognised as having an administrative structure<lb/> which is business friendly.<lb/> In Estonia, two pilot projects were being undertaken in 2006, with obvious interest, in the Ministry<lb/> of Economic Affairs and Communications in order to test the Dutch Standard Cost Model.<lb/> Several ministries and offices (e.g., Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of the<lb/> Environment, and the Statistical Office and the Tax and Customs Board) have been involved in<lb/> the leading group for testing the model.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In contrast, one official in Hungary commented that the results of surveys of this kind are<lb/> sometimes unsatisfying as the task of collecting information about administrative costs is carried<lb/> out sporadically and there is very often a strong reluctance on the part of officials to participate in<lb/> these types of projects.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Nevertheless, a joint project was initiated by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice in<lb/> Hungary to assess the administrative burdens of VAT regulations. The Minister of Justice<lb/> initiated a comprehensive programme for the reduction of administrative burdens, which is based<lb/> on the Standard Cost Model, but is completed by the survey of economic costs beyond the<lb/> business sphere (costs for the citizens). The first phase (total mapping of the burdensome<lb/> regulations) was planned for the first half of 2005. As the project budget was reduced to a<lb/> minimum, it is being undertaken with fewer resources over a longer period of time. Results are<lb/> not expected before the middle of 2007.<lb/> In Poland, three pilot projects have already been implemented:<lb/> •<lb/> A study, supported by the Office of the Committee for European Integration, was<lb/> completed in December 2005 on the SCM and the perceptions of administrative costs in<lb/> the road transport sector.<lb/> •<lb/> Another study, supported by the Ministry of Finance, was aimed at measuring the<lb/> administrative costs related to compliance with the information obligations required to be<lb/> met by VAT payers in Poland. This study gave a rather alarming picture of the tax<lb/> sector, since the level of administrative barriers was estimated at approximately 45.7%<lb/> of all tax revenues in 2004.<lb/> •<lb/> A third study was conducted on the initiative of the National Bank of Poland on<lb/> administrative costs relating to the application of banking law.<lb/> A plan for administrative burden reduction was submitted to the Council of Ministers, together<lb/> with the comprehensive Regulatory Reform Programme, for adoption in August 2006.<lb/> The lessons learned during the first benchmark were used to improve the method. In 2005<lb/> Poland and the Netherlands have conducted a benchmark on transport legislation. This was<lb/> done according to the benchmarking method described in the international manual. The results of<lb/> this benchmark are set out in Benchmark Transport EU Legislation Poland – The Netherlands 108 .<lb/> For Poland, the benchmark was part of a more extensive research into their transport<lb/> legislation 109 .<lb/> In the Slovak Republic, a paper 110 prepared on the initiative of the National Agency for<lb/> Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (NADSME), assessed the status and identified<lb/> 108<lb/> See: www.administrative-burdens.com.<lb/> 109<lb/> See: M.

However,<lb/> the paper recognises that there is not sufficient data available to measure administrative costs<lb/> burdening SMEs.<lb/></table>

			<head>Simplification of Form<lb/></head>

			<p>No coherent pattern can be seen in the NMS as regards the simplification of the form (language,<lb/> style, structure, coherence, including its accessibility) of legislation. Some countries have<lb/> undertaken extensive reforms while others do so on an &apos;as needed&apos; basis.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2005, a systematic review of the regulations of the government was undertaken, coordinated<lb/> by the State Chancellery. As a result of this review, regulations that were no longer of practical<lb/> utility or were ultra vires, were repealed 111 .<lb/></p>

			<figure>Each year the Legal Chancellor in Estonia gives an overview to the parliament of the conformity<lb/> of the legislation, generally, with the Constitution and general principles of law 112 . This usually<lb/> results in amendments being made to correct errors discovered in laws. A systematic review of<lb/> the regulations of the government and the ministers, coordinated by the State Chancellery, was<lb/> undertaken in 2005.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A review 113 has been undertaken to repeal spent or unused legislation and progress is being<lb/> made towards requiring public bodies to seek information from their own records rather than<lb/> impose the burden on citizens of repeatedly providing the same information.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no policy to simplify the language used in legislation, although the Constitutional Court<lb/> ruled that Article 2 of the Constitution, which refers to the legal certainty principle, also includes<lb/> the clarity of norms. On this basis, it declared invalid a regulation because of its complexity.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Hungary, a simplification exercise was undertaken after the fall of communism which<lb/> addressed the form and content of the stock of legislation. It was believed to be essential to<lb/> reduce the number of rules that had no longer any practical utility and several systematic<lb/> deregulation programmes were implemented.<lb/> Further initiatives to deregulate were undertaken, following the same principles and policy. The<lb/> 2004 Programme on Law Simplification contained the task of mapping the changes in<lb/> administrative costs caused by new legislation over a 4-month period. Having received<lb/> responses from the ministries, the coordinating unit of the Ministry of Justice suspended this<lb/> project and, instead, asked ministries for ideas from their own experiences for simplification. The<lb/> proposal for the year 2005 was formulated having regard to these experiences 114 .<lb/> 111<lb/> See Administrative Procedures Act, Section 93 (1): &quot; A regulation is valid until it is repealed by an administrative authority of<lb/> the Supreme Court, or until expiry, or until repeal of the provision delegating authority. &quot;<lb/> 112<lb/> See the 2004 English version of the overview: http://www.oiguskantsler.ee/.files/36.pdf.<lb/> 113<lb/></figure>

			<p>There have been several specific projects to assess the potential to reduce the administrative burdens of legislation. For<lb/> example, in 2001, a study was undertaken by PRAXIS. It involved three areas:<lb/> 񮽙 mapping out and analysing the specific and procedural issues related to the licensing of business activity from both the<lb/> government and corporate points of view. The goal was to deliver specific guidelines for the government to enable it to<lb/> reorganise the current licensing procedure, and make the Estonian business climate more entrepreneur-friendly.<lb/> 񮽙 Reviewing the regulations on the Law on Administrative Procedure.<lb/> 񮽙 A study of checklists, and their use, to ensure due cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of<lb/> government in updating the administrative procedure. In this project, PRAXIS&apos;s partners were government agencies and<lb/> the Riigikogu. The project team compiled checklists that would enable speedy analysis of a draft law entailing<lb/> administrative procedure (especially licensing). The checklists could be eventually used by legislators and Riigikogu<lb/> committees. The goal is to ensure standard government regulation, reduce the complexity of administrative procedure<lb/> and create a tool for coordinated policy-making.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, within the framework of a comprehensive anti-bureaucracy programme, the Ministry<lb/> of Finance has started to screen the financial legislation to identify possible areas of<lb/> simplification. Codexes exist in several areas, such as criminal law and civil law. However, there<lb/> is a view that there is a tendency to have too many specific codexes.<lb/> In Latvia, where 50% or more of the articles of a draft regulation need to be amended, a new<lb/> version of the regulation must be issued.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplification of Procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a variety of approaches to simplification in the NMS. In some NMS, concern for<lb/> simplification is driven by the business sector.</p>

			<figure>In the Slovak Republic, for example,<lb/> administrative costs were considered in a 2004 paper prepared on the initiative of the National<lb/> Agency for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises 115 , which assessed the status and<lb/> development of SMEs in the Slovak Republic.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In most NMS, a number of simplification initiatives and proposals for the reduction of<lb/> administrative burdens are in place but their number and variety suggest the need to consolidate<lb/> them, in order to ensure that they are focussed and that the full benefits of these policies can be<lb/> achieved.<lb/></p>

			<p>One way to reduce administrative burdens is to reduce the occurrence of circumstances where<lb/> the same information is sought by several authorities. For example, in Estonia and Latvia, new<lb/> laws are reviewed to ensure that the production of a piece of information is not required from<lb/> citizens where that information is already available to the authority.<lb/> In Estonia, institutions have been given the right to authenticate copies of original documents<lb/> presented to them and issued by them, so that the citizens do not have to go to notaries to have<lb/> documents authenticated.<lb/> In Latvia, if a state body is obliged to establish whether it already has the information before it<lb/> requests it from a person or small business. An audit of the bureaucratic procedures in order to<lb/> ensure considerable simplification and transparent decision-making is foreseen. It is planned to<lb/> review the body of legislation to ensure that the principle &apos;ask once use many times&apos; is applied.<lb/></p>

			<head>One-stop-shops<lb/></head>

			<p>Another way consists in establishing a contact point with citizens such as &apos;one-stop-shops&apos; where<lb/> citizens and businesses may complete several kinds of administrative procedures.<lb/> In Cyprus, the first &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; for citizens was opened in December 2005 so as to deliver<lb/> better access to certain categories of government information and a range of services. It brings<lb/> together the following services: identity documents, car registration, health and social benefits.<lb/> In Malta, the Malta Tourism Authority acts as a &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; for tourism-related businesses.<lb/> The Small Business Directorate, within the Commerce Division of the Ministry for<lb/> Competitiveness and Communication, operates a helpline for small businesses that have<lb/> difficulties with red tape. It forwards complaints of excessive red tape reported by businesses to<lb/> the responsible authorities.<lb/></p>

			<head>115<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper pointed out that the most significant factors influencing the business environment of Slovakia in 2004 were the<lb/> implementation of the new tax system, making administrative procedures required upon business start up more efficient, the<lb/> changes in the system of social security to a system of social insurance, the improvement of communication with tax offices<lb/> and the adoption of more flexible bankruptcy legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Information Technology (IT)<lb/></head>

			<p>In general, most of the initiatives taken rely on the use of IT tools to simplify procedures and to<lb/> improve the coordination between authorities and all the stakeholders involved and, in general, to<lb/> develop a more citizen-friendly administration.<lb/> Regarding the use of IT tools and e-government in general, some NMS are more advanced than<lb/> others. However, the development of IT tools may result in reducing administrative burdens,<lb/> provided internet access is well developed, which may not be the case in some NMS, such as<lb/> Latvia.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 1998, the government initiated an &apos;Information Systems Strategy&apos; was set up in Cyprus. In the<lb/> last 5 years, improvements have been made not only in the number but also in the level of the<lb/> public services provided through the web. Most of the government ministries or departments or<lb/> services have their own websites. The majority of the websites are informative and provide<lb/> downloading of forms and other documents. Some also support user interaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the last few years improvements have been made not only in the number but also in the level<lb/> of e-services provided to the public. All Government Ministries/Departments/Services maintain<lb/> their own websites 116 which are either informative and provide downloading of forms and other<lb/> documents or also support user interaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>The development of &quot; Citizen Centric &quot; web-enabled systems, which has evolved as part of the<lb/> Information Systems Strategy, is an ongoing process. Currently, a considerable number of<lb/> e-services, such as the electronic submission of tax returns, the road tax license renewal using<lb/> credit cards, the payment of social contributions for employees or for the self-employed using the<lb/> &quot; direct debit &quot; payment method, etc., are provided to the public by the Government.<lb/></p>

			<head>In the Czech Republic, the Public Administration Portal 117 has been in operation since 2004. It<lb/></head>

			<p>serves as a single gateway between the public administration and citizens, businesses and<lb/> institutions. The Portal includes a full public administration directory, Czech and European<lb/> legislation, a database of detailed, suggested solutions for over 300 specific transactions with the<lb/> authorities, the electronic Commercial Register, a facility for viewing parts of the Land Register, a<lb/> public procurement overview and news from individual departments, etc.<lb/></p>

			<p>Certain online services are available to citizens via the Public Administration Portal, including:<lb/> filing of tax returns, applications for social benefits and services related to public healthcare. For<lb/> companies, the services include: filing of statements related to social and health insurance of<lb/> employees, filing of tax returns, filing of excise duty declarations, simplification of online<lb/> completion and filing of statistical reports or electronic customs declarations.<lb/> Central public administration in Hungary is fully covered by computer systems, with a network<lb/> access rate of almost 70% and the majority of ministries having their own home pages. In 1998,<lb/> the so-called &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; IT systems were created for the registration of sole proprietors and<lb/> economic associations 118 . The modernisation of the Internet portal of the Ministry for Justice<lb/> involved the creation of a forum for recommendations and feedback concerning the problems of<lb/> lawmaking.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Malta IT tools were developed with a view to increasing administrative efficiency and<lb/> simplifying procedures. For example, a common database was set up to ensure that whenever<lb/> information contained in a public database is amended, this change will also be made in all public<lb/> databases.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, e-government is developing but is at the &apos;start up&apos; phase. Some<lb/> initiatives have been taken recently, including those to simplify business registration. Standard<lb/> forms can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Justice. The registration is complete<lb/> within five days, once the requested documents and the completed form have been provided by<lb/> a company.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Slovenia, the portal, e-government 119 , was launched on 22 May 2006. It is an access point to<lb/> public administration information and services which lists information in groups of life events. The<lb/> portal provides easy access to information as well as user-friendly use of services offered by the<lb/> state. The modernised portal includes a more comprehensive list of civil servants to whom a<lb/> citizen can submit an application and it enables the citizen to communicate with public<lb/> administration bodies, which ensures a quick response and user-friendly information. For<lb/> example, it is possible to renew a driving licence online, thanks to the state portal e-government.<lb/> The Ministry of Public Administration hosts a state portal for businesses called e-VEM 120 , which<lb/> was launched on 1 July 2006. It enables the prospective sole trader to register in the Slovenian<lb/> Business Register and forwards the information to the Tax Administration. It is planed to expand<lb/> the e-VEM system to facilitate the registration of other types of companies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Development of a More Citizen-friendly Administration<lb/></head>

			<p>In many NMS, initiatives to develop a more citizen-friendly administration have been<lb/> implemented, including the establishment of a quality service charter or a focus on some<lb/> administrative principles of law.<lb/> In Malta, the Office of the Prime Minister developed a model of Quality Service Charter that<lb/> ministries may adopt on a voluntary basis and adapt to their specific fields of activity in order to<lb/> ensure that citizens are served as quickly as possible.<lb/></p>

			<p>Some principles of administrative law may help to reduce administrative burdens. The Estonian<lb/> Administrative Procedures Act requires the Estonian public service to provide administrative<lb/> procedures that are efficient and provided with the least cost and delay to users 121 .<lb/></p>

			<head>Dialogue with Stakeholders Committed to the Reduction of Administrative Burden<lb/></head>

			<p>In some countries, coordination between authorities and all stakeholders involved regarding the<lb/> reduction of administrative burden was strengthened through the establishment of a working<lb/> group specifically in charge of these issues.<lb/> In Lithuania, a Standing Committee for Business Environment Improvement 122 was established<lb/> by the Prime Minister, involving representatives of business institutions, independent experts,<lb/> specialists of state institutions, science and education institutions. The committee aims at the<lb/> simplification of the business environment and its working method is based on close cooperation<lb/> between authorities and business organizations.<lb/> However, in other countries, such as the Slovak Republic, there is no coordinated exchange of<lb/> information between public service bodies. There is no central point such as a &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; to<lb/> assist businesses, and in particular SMEs, and citizens dealing with administrative procedures<lb/> and registration processes required by public service bodies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Accessibility<lb/></head>

			<p>It is essential for the good governance of a country that laws enacted to bind individuals and<lb/> corporate people should be accessible to them and their advisers. This means that not only<lb/> should they be able to find the laws but when they find them they should be able to follow them<lb/> easily without having to refer from one text to another in a paper trail of cross-cutting<lb/> amendments and overlapping requirements. Developments in Information Technology have<lb/> aided considerably the process of making legislation and other official information available<lb/> electronically and most countries now have some form of web-based access to legislation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Publication in the Official Gazette and on the Internet<lb/></head>

			<p>In all countries, primary and secondary regulation must be published in the Official Gazette in<lb/> paper texts and in most countries it is also accessible online. Of particular interest is that in<lb/></p>

			<figure>Estonia and Malta both versions (paper and electronic) have the same legal force. In Estonia, if<lb/> the electronic version and the paper version of the same legislation published contradict each<lb/> other, the paper version prevails and the State Chancellery must be notified of the contradiction.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In all other NMS, except in Cyprus, the internet version of legislation is free of charge. In most<lb/> NMS, there is a slight delay between the publication of legislation on the internet and the<lb/> publication on paper. However, in Estonia, legislation and other documents are published in the<lb/> electronic Riigi Teataja at the same time as the Riigi Teataja (Official Gazette) is published on<lb/> paper.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Lithuania, all legislation must be published on the website of the parliament or the website of<lb/> the institution which adopted it, within three days of its official publication in the Official Gazette.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Official Journal websites are maintained by various ministries in the NMS. The Ministry of Justice<lb/> (Hungary, Malta, and the Slovak Republic) or the State Chancellery (Estonia, Latvia) is<lb/> responsible for publishing the Official Gazette, including its publication on the internet.<lb/> In the Czech Republic, there is a searchable database of legislation available free of charge on<lb/> the Public Administration Portal 123 . The scanned issues of the Official Gazette can also be<lb/> downloaded free of charge from the website of the Ministry of the Interior 124 . The same website<lb/> provides a similar search in the database of international treaties.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Cyprus, internet accessibility is possible through several other websites such as Leginet 125 ,<lb/> which is a vast database of legal materials such as titles of laws and regulations as well as the<lb/> full text of laws. In Cyprus, also, an index of Primary Legislation (Titles of Laws and Regulations)<lb/> is published in the Gazette. The House of Representatives&apos; website includes indexes to all<lb/> legislation in the form of yearly volumes. In addition, the Law Commissioner&apos;s Office drew up an<lb/> index for international treaties called &apos;Index of International <ref type="biblio">Treaties 1960 – 2004.<lb/></ref> In Latvia, all EC Directives and Regulations may also be found on the webpage of the Ministry of<lb/> Foreign Affairs and the Centre of Terminology.<lb/> In Lithuania when legislation is amended, an unofficial text of the legislation is published which<lb/> sets out the original text as amended.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Malta, the Department of Information, within the Office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for<lb/> publishing the Government Gazette, including its publication on the internet. All subsidiary<lb/> legislation, including bye-laws, is available on the Department of Information website 126 . In<lb/> Cyprus and Lithuania, a database of regulations is available on the Parliament&apos;s website.<lb/> In Poland, every year, starting from 31 March, an index of all regulations published in the official<lb/> journal in a given year will be issued.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some countries, in addition to the text of the laws, indexes of titles of laws and regulations are<lb/> published. In Lithuania, public institutions publish titles of regulations in force within the sphere<lb/> of their competence with respective references to relevant versions of regulations that are<lb/> available in the database of regulations of the parliament.<lb/></p>

			<head>Access to Consolidated Versions<lb/></head>

			<p>In Estonia, since 2006, consolidated versions of legislation are published at the same time as<lb/> the publication of an amending Act.<lb/> After amendment or repeal of a piece of legislation, a consolidated text of this piece of legislation,<lb/> setting out all the amendments made to the original text, is prepared and published electronically<lb/> in the Riigi Teataja (the State Gazette). All legislation is consolidated in this manner 127 .<lb/></p>

			<p>In Latvia, regulations, once amended, are made available by the Ministry of Justice in an<lb/> annotated form 128 . All regulations are collected in a database (NAIS) partially funded from the<lb/> state budget and partially from subscriptions from selling the annotation service. It is planned to<lb/> make this database available to the public free of charge and to link regulations with annotations<lb/> and related materials.<lb/> In Malta, when legislation has been amended, it is re-published with the amendments in place.<lb/> The website of the Ministry of Justice is regularly updated to include any recent amendments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, there is a Central Register of Laws website 129 where it is possible to<lb/> read laws that have been amended as a single text, in consolidated form.<lb/> In Slovenia, the parliament publishes a consolidated text of legislation, once a principal Act in a<lb/> series of Acts is amended. The consolidated text is not re-enacted but it is accepted as an official<lb/> version of the legislation and as evidence of its contents.<lb/></p>

			<head>Publication of Court Decisions<lb/></head>

			<p>In Cyprus and Estonia, a database of court statistics and court decisions will soon be made<lb/> available to the public.<lb/> In Cyprus, a web-enabled system is scheduled to be developed under the Ministry of Justice and<lb/> Public Order. Once completed, the system will give access to all judgments, laws, regulations<lb/> and other legal material to judges, lawyers, government officers, other external bodies and the<lb/> public.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Estonia, all Supreme Court decisions are available in the State Gazette, on paper, and on the<lb/> homepage of the Supreme Court. In addition, a database (the &apos;KOLA&apos;), in use since 2001, is<lb/> 126<lb/> www.doi.gov.mt.<lb/> 127<lb/> 1) Acts of laws; 2) decrees of the President of the Republic; 3) regulations and orders of the Government of the Republic; 4)<lb/> regulations of ministers; 5) regulations of the President of the Bank of Estonia; 6) regulations of the National Electoral<lb/> Committee.<lb/> 128<lb/> The compilation of the materials is undertaken by one official in the Ministry of Justice but the annotation work is undertaken<lb/> by a private sector firm. The texts are not fully consolidated in the normal sense of the word but are annotated with links to<lb/> enable the reader to follow easily a text that has been amended on a number of occasions.<lb/></figure>

			<p>divided into parts accessible to the public. Statistical returns related to judicial proceedings are<lb/> also accessible to the public. The authorised users of the &apos;KOLA&apos; have access to all the courts of<lb/> the Estonia. The courts enter in the &apos;KOLA&apos; notice of all court proceedings before them.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> ENACTMENT BY PARLIAMENT<lb/> The capacity of the enactment process in parliament may be assessed by reference to:<lb/></head>

			<p>•<lb/></p>

			<table>The structure for enacting primary legislation.<lb/> •<lb/> Thee procedures for enacting primary legislation<lb/> •<lb/> The question of when parliament initiates legislation – does it follow the same processes<lb/> of policy debate and law drafting as is followed by the extensive branch of government.<lb/> •<lb/> The resources available to parliament to enable members of parliament to research<lb/> issues arising in legislation.<lb/> •<lb/> The outputs of parliament and to what extent does the legislature indicate legislation<lb/> independently of the executive branch of government.<lb/></table>

			<head>Structures for Enacting Primary Legislation<lb/></head>

			<p>Generally, parliaments are only concerned with primary legislation; however, the House of<lb/> Representatives in Cyprus also discusses secondary legislation, in detail.<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority of parliaments in the NMS are unicameral, as can be seen from the table below.<lb/> The question of whether there should be one or two legislative chambers is one of the most<lb/> frequently asked questions of parliamentary design 130 . The procedures for debate vary from NMS<lb/> to NMS, though they all follow a broadly similar pattern of three readings.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bicameral parliaments are to be found in Poland and the Slovak Republic. A further variation<lb/> on this theme is Slovenia and, to some extent the Czech Republic, which have an incomplete<lb/> bi-cameral structure. This means that the upper chamber does not have equal competencies with<lb/> the lower chamber and has less authority. The purpose of upper chambers in incomplete<lb/> bi-cameral systems, which on a world scale are more common than complete bi-cameral<lb/> systems, is to supervise the work of the lower chamber.<lb/></p>

			<p>As may be seen from the</p>

It would require a very detailed analysis of the progress of a particular Bill, across<lb/> all</table>

			<p>the parliaments, to form a view as to whether one procedure is more efficient than another. A<lb/> feature in common is that Bills are reviewed in three readings in all NMS. The complex<lb/> procedures allow time for issues to be considered and it is unlikely that a Bill will be enacted by<lb/> any of these parliaments without a high degree of scrutiny. Some parliaments have, and make<lb/> full use of, accelerated procedures 131 . What follows is an overview, which illustrates the<lb/> complexity of the process and underlines the need for NMS to keep their procedures under<lb/> review. They should ask themselves at some point:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Why are these systems so different?<lb/> •<lb/> What purpose is served by the different procedures?<lb/> •<lb/> Could laws be debated and enacted in a more efficient and effective manner?<lb/></p>

			<head>First Reading<lb/></head>

			<p>The first &apos;reading&apos; in all NMS is the submission of the draft law to the parliament. However, in<lb/> Slovenia, the first reading may be avoided and it takes place only if requested by at least 10<lb/> members of parliament (deputies) (out of 90).<lb/> In Malta the introduction of a Bill is based on a motion requesting &quot;that leave be given to bring in<lb/> such a Bill&quot;. The first reading is, therefore, a formal approval of the title of the Bill.<lb/> In other countries, the first reading may be for the purpose of designating a committee to take<lb/> charge of a Bill (</p>

			<figure>Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Second Reading<lb/></head>

			<p>The second reading in</p>

			<figure>Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary and Latvia, is initiated by the presentation of<lb/> a report made by the committee in charge of studying the Bill. The role of the committee at this<lb/> stage is to focus on the general principles of the Bill. In the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and the<lb/> Slovak Republic, the second reading initiates a more detailed deliberation, section by section,<lb/> on the basis of the report of the committee in charge.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, the National Council may only debate a Bill in the second reading after<lb/> at least 48 hours have elapsed from the time the report of the committee established to consider<lb/> the Bill was delivered. In Malta, when a day is fixed for the second reading of a Bill, the Clerk of<lb/> the House gives each Member of the House a printed copy and causes it to be published in the<lb/> Malta Government Gazette.<lb/> In Slovenia, at the second reading stage, the working body of the National Assembly responsible<lb/> debates the Bill, article by article, before it is debated by the National Assembly as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<p>Proposed amendments may then be considered at the second reading stage (Czech Republic,<lb/> Estonia, and Hungary). In Estonia, after the close of the first reading, members of the Riigikogu<lb/> can submit motions to amend to the leading committee. If that committee accepts a proposed<lb/> amendment, it is put to a vote. The second reading of a draft may be suspended to leave<lb/> additional time for improving the draft law and submitting motions to amend.<lb/></p>

			<head>131<lb/></head>

			<p>In some countries, such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Slovak Republic, the Standing Order of the Parliament<lb/> establishes a so-called accelerated legislative procedure, according to which the timing of the enactment procedure is<lb/> reduced, usually through the reduction of the number of compulsory readings. For example, in the Slovak Republic, all three<lb/> necessary readings take place during a single plenary session.<lb/> The excessive use of such procedures, as is pointed out by the National Council of the Slovak Republic, may reflect a lack of<lb/> adequate preparation on the part of the government or a less than efficient working on the part of the parliament.<lb/></p>

			<p>Between the second and third reading, in the Czech Republic and Poland, a Bill or draft<lb/> resolution may be returned to the committees which considered it in the event of new<lb/> amendments and motions being introduced during the second reading. In the Czech Republic, a<lb/> detailed parliamentary debate is held on specific provisions of the draft and proposed<lb/> amendments when the Chamber of Deputies has decided not to return a draft to a committee for<lb/> further debate. In Poland, committees may present to the Sejm an additional report in which they<lb/> may propose adoption or rejection of the Bill as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<head>Third Reading<lb/> In Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia, amendments</head>

			<p>may be<lb/> considered, following the third reading. In Malta, only verbal amendments may be made to any<lb/> law on the third reading. In the Slovak Republic, the third reading is restricted only to those<lb/> provisions to which altering or amending proposals have been approved in the second reading. A<lb/> Deputy may only propose, in the third reading, an amendment of legislative-technical<lb/> irregularities and grammatical errors. At the third reading stage in all NMS, the draft is debated<lb/> for the last time; once the debates are closed, the draft law is put to a final vote.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Slovenia, amendments may be tabled to those articles to which amendments have been<lb/> adopted in the second reading. The government may propose an amendment, provided it did not<lb/> propose the Bill debated. The government or the member proposing the Bill may propose<lb/> amendments to those amendments but not to the original text proposed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Vote by the Other Assembly in the Case of a Bicameral Parliament<lb/></head>

			<p>In the case of a bicameral parliament, such as in the Czech Republic and Poland, once the<lb/> draft Bill has been adopted by one assembly, it is submitted to the other assembly which may<lb/> approve of, reject or amend the Bill. In the two latter cases, the Bill is returned to the assembly<lb/> which first discussed it and there is a procedure to ensure that a consensus is achieved,<lb/> eventually, between the two assemblies.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, senators may attend a sitting of the Chamber of Deputies and justify the<lb/> ruling of the Senate where a Bill has been returned with proposed amendments or if a Bill has<lb/> been rejected.<lb/> In Poland, the Senate, within 30 days of submission of a Bill, may adopt it without amendment,<lb/> adopt amendments or resolve upon its complete rejection 132 . If, within 30 days following the<lb/> submission of the Bill to the Assembly, the Senate fails to adopt an appropriate resolution, the Bill<lb/> is considered adopted according to the wording submitted by the Sejm. A similar procedure<lb/> exists in the Czech Republic.<lb/></p>

			<head>Initiation by Members of Parliament of Bills and Amendments<lb/></head>

			<p>When members of parliament initiate legislation or propose amendments, it is essential that they<lb/> do so with the same attention to technical detail, as is the case with a Bill or amendment<lb/> prepared by a member of government with the technical assistance of his or her officials. To do<lb/> otherwise can result in inadequate laws being proposed and in the quality of legislation being<lb/> damaged by poorly thought out amendments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to review the extent to which Better Regulation principles are embedded in a country, it<lb/> is important to consider whether proposals by members of parliament are subjected to the same<lb/> processes of policy analysis and law drafting as those followed in the executive branch of<lb/> government.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some NMS, efforts are made to safeguard the integrity of the outputs of parliament by ensuring<lb/> that proposals for Bills and amendments suggested by members of parliament are subject to a<lb/> detailed analytical review, outside the partisan debates in the chamber of the parliament.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In certain countries (Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, and the Slovak Republic), Bills initiated by<lb/> members of parliament should be submitted to the government, for observations. In some<lb/> countries, Bills are accompanied by an explanatory paper (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Slovak<lb/> Republic and Slovenia) in the same way as government Bills.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Lithuania, a draft law must be sent to the European Law Department in the Ministry of Justice<lb/> for evaluation of its consistency with European Union Law. The government, if consulted, is only<lb/> entitled to give a conclusion and propose amendments. Amendments may not be made to a draft<lb/> law, without the consent of a working group of the parliament.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Slovak Republic, a proposal by parliament is forwarded by the chairperson of the<lb/> National Council to the Government for opinion. It is discussed within the Legislative Council and<lb/> presented to the government by the minister in whose field of competence the proposal falls. If<lb/> the government does not take a position on the proposal within a 30-day period, the proposal is<lb/> discussed by the National Council and, in any case, the position of the government is only of<lb/> recommendatory character.<lb/> In Slovenia, Bills submitted to parliament must be accompanied by documentation that states<lb/> whether or not impact assessments and consultations have been undertaken and the secretariat<lb/> of the parliament may reject a Bill which is not accompanied by at least a notional impact<lb/> assessment. The quality of these impact assessments is not reviewed by the secretariat so,<lb/> inevitably, the quality of the assessments is variable.<lb/></p>

			<head>Rules of Procedure<lb/></head>

			<p>Coherent and efficient rules on the organisation of plenary debates are a major factor in ensuring<lb/> the quality of parliamentary debates and, therefore, the quality of parliamentary outputs and laws<lb/> enacted. In particular, efforts are made through the committee system to place greater emphasis<lb/> on the work of parliamentary standing committees in order to reserve plenary sessions for<lb/> debates on major issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>The standing orders or rules of procedure usually represent the main source of the rules<lb/> regulating the order, timing and organisation of plenary debates, as well as the quorum.<lb/> However, the Constitution may also contain essential provisions in this regard, as it is the case in<lb/></p>

			<head>Cyprus.<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the standing orders establish organs, such as a chairperson and a board, which<lb/> ensures the logistical organisation of the parliamentary debates.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, the coordination of the work of the Chamber of Deputies rests with the<lb/> chairperson and the deputy chairperson. The chairperson of the Chamber of Deputies is<lb/> represented by deputy chairpersons on his or her command, or in the order which has been<lb/> specified.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relative Positions of Legislature by Executive Branch of Government<lb/></head>

			<p>The relations between the members of the executive branch of government and the parliament<lb/> are ruled either by the Constitution, the rules of procedures of the parliament, or inter-institutional<lb/> agreements.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Two distinct patterns may be seen in the NMS. The first is where the executive branch of<lb/> government dominates the legislature (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta). The<lb/> second is where the legislative branch plays a more active role. In the Czech Republic,<lb/> Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic, parliaments have a more independent approach to<lb/> handling the executive branch of government.</figure>

			<p>This may have adverse consequences for the<lb/> quality of the resulting legislation, as the government does not exercise much control over<lb/> amendments introduced at the enactment stage. Slovenia lies somewhere in between these two<lb/> positions as its parliament is independent but respectful of the needs of the executive branch of<lb/> government.<lb/></p>

			<head>Positive Trend<lb/></head>

			<p>In a few NMS, inter-institutional agreements have been signed between the government and the<lb/> parliament in order to enhance the efficiency of the enactment process. In Poland, the 2004 Law<lb/> on Cooperation of the Council of Ministers with the Sejm and Senate on matters relating to<lb/> membership of the EU include provisions on the timely enactment of drafts transposing EU Laws.<lb/> However, the coordination between these two constitutional bodies only refers to EU-related<lb/> issues and does not cover other areas.<lb/> In Slovenia, the cooperation of the government and national assembly on EU affairs is governed<lb/> by the Act on Cooperation between the National Assembly and the Government in EU Affairs 133 ,<lb/> which stipulates that they cooperate in preparing positions and comments in cases where, in a<lb/> comparable national situation, a document would be elaborated on in the National Assembly. In<lb/> other cases, the government informs the National Assembly of developments.<lb/></p>

			<head>Resources Available to Parliament<lb/></head>

			<p>Parliaments are relatively well-served by research facilities and researchers.</p>

			<figure>In most countries<lb/> (Cyprus, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic), each member of parliament<lb/> has a parliamentary assistant who holds a University degree.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Slovenia, the National Assembly provides each deputy group with a secretary, two specialised<lb/> staff members and a clerk; an additional clerk is provided for every group of eight deputies; a<lb/> group having more than eight deputies is provided with an additional specialised staff member.<lb/> In Estonia, the Parliament has adhered to the same technical rules on drafting as the<lb/> government, which include the necessity to examine a list of impacts that need to be assessed<lb/> when drafting legislation; and the support staff may assist members of parliament in conducting<lb/> these assessments.<lb/> In Lithuania, the Information Analysis Department at the Office of Parliament provides<lb/> comparative analysis and interpretation of regulations of foreign states, analysis of regulatory<lb/> practice in various fields and any information requested by members of parliament. The<lb/> Department often contributes to the reasoning provided by the Legal Department of the<lb/> Parliament, when the latter carries out the analysis and interpretation of Lithuanian regulations.<lb/> In Poland, the Chancellery of the Sejm includes, in addition to the Sejm Library, the Office for<lb/> Research which is responsible for providing legal, social and economic analysis for the legislation<lb/> process, and the Office for Legislation, which participates in committee work and assists<lb/> members of the Sejm by drafting Bills and amendments.<lb/></p>

			<figure>All parliaments in NMS appear to fall short of the expertise available to governments. In<lb/> Hungary, the Office of the Parliament has 660 staff; the number of support staff varies but is<lb/> usually relatively limited. Only 15 officials are involved in the administration of the Parliament in<lb/> Cyprus, of which only a few have research competencies. The same number of staff is employed<lb/> at the Parliamentary Institute in the Czech Republic.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, there are a number of problems with legislation relating to the lack of<lb/> quality of amendments proposed to legislation and to the lack of discipline in the management of<lb/> legislation. Many amendments proposed do not take full account of the scope and intention of the<lb/> legislation or refer to a matter that is not covered at all by the draft law discussed. If enacted,<lb/> these amendments distort badly the sense of the Bill to which the amendments are proposed and<lb/> make the resulting law difficult to apply.<lb/> In Slovenia, the review of laws carried out by the legislative and legal service is purely formal<lb/> and does not address the substance of the proposal. In addition, it appears to duplicate the<lb/> review that is carried out by the Secretariat General of the Government.<lb/></p>

			<head>Outputs<lb/></head>

			<figure>In all NMS, members of parliament may propose legislation. In Cyprus, by virtue of the<lb/> Constitution, a member of the House of Representatives may propose a law, provided it does not<lb/> burden the state budget.<lb/> In a number of NMS, Bills may be proposed as a result of a petition of a number of citizens. In<lb/> Lithuania, for example, 50 000 citizens may submit a draft law to the parliament. In Poland,<lb/> 100 000, and in Slovenia, five thousand or more voters may introduce a legislative proposal.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In practice, and in general, in the NMS studied, the majority of the laws debated and enacted are<lb/> introduced by the Government and very few draft laws proposed by members of the parliament,<lb/> or by any other person or body, are passed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Much of the work of parliaments in NMS has been devoted in recent years to the implementation<lb/> of European Union legislation and, in this regard, their output has been considerable.<lb/> However, the quality of the work undertaken in such a short period of time and under such<lb/> intense pressure is being questioned. In many NMS, domestic issues were almost entirely left<lb/> aside and what is needed now is a period of reflection and review. In many NMS, officials and<lb/> representatives from businesses and NGOs stressed the need for parliaments to slow the pace<lb/> and concentrate more on quality rather than quantity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reports and Public Inquiries<lb/></head>

			<p>Parliamentary committees have the right to invite cabinet members to their meetings and to ask<lb/> them for explanations, reports and necessary documents; they are under an obligation to attend<lb/> a committee meeting, provide requisite explanations and reports and present documents.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bills are usually discussed in committees at the first stages of the enactment process as, in most<lb/> countries, except in Malta where debates on the Bill sections in plenary sessions are held on the<lb/> basis of the comments provided by the relevant committee. Although the powers of parliamentary<lb/> committees may vary from one NMS to another, committees usually have the right to consider<lb/> fully the Bill submitted.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Lithuania, the scope and importance of the parliamentary committees has increased<lb/> significantly following the adoption of the 1999 Statute of the Parliament 152 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>In all NMS, committees may require that members of the government or the administration<lb/> provide more information. In addition, debates at committee stage usually involve consultations<lb/> with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives of civil society and experts.<lb/></p>

			<p>In most NMS, the parliament and parliamentary committees have the right to submit to the prime<lb/> minister or to an individual minister questions and requests for further documents for which the<lb/> latter is responsible (Cyprus, the</p>

			<figure>Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic<lb/> and Slovenia).<lb/> A particular feature of the enactment process in Cyprus and Latvia consists in the fact that, not<lb/> only ministers, but also officials are called before committees of the parliament and are required<lb/> explaining policy decisions.<lb/> In Cyprus, the Czech Republic (Senate), Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, committees or even<lb/> the parliament may invite not only the representatives of the government but also all the<lb/> interested parties to present their opinion. However, procedures organising public hearings are<lb/> very often neither fixed nor systematically used.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Lithuania, following the 1999 Statute of the Parliament 153 , the committee concerned sends the<lb/> Bill to all interested state institutions and, if necessary, to public organisations, self-governments,<lb/> political parties and organisations. The period allowed for consultation is longer than that allowed<lb/> for government consultations. However, there appears to be no fixed rule on this issue.<lb/> In Latvia, NGOs may attend plenary sessions and parliamentary committee meetings. However,<lb/> NGOs with only a sporadic interest in an individual piece of legislation do run into difficulties of<lb/> access, such as the inability to secure a pass to enter parliamentary buildings. In addition, the<lb/> parliament has, only on rare occasions, held hearings in order to solicit the views of the NGO<lb/> community.<lb/></p>

			<head>152<lb/></head>

			<p>Entered into force on 1 February 1999.<lb/> 153<lb/></p>

			<p>In Poland, a public hearing may be held on a Bill, providing that a resolution referring the Bill to a<lb/> committee for consideration is passed by the committee.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limited Capacity for Independent Inquiry<lb/></head>

			<p>In most NMS, the capacity of parliaments to conduct independent inquiry remains limited. In<lb/> Hungary, no public inquiries are held by the parliament. In some NMS, e.g., the</p>

			<figure>Czech Republic<lb/> (Chamber of Deputies), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia, select or investigatory<lb/> committees may be appointed by the parliament.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In Lithuania, for resolving short-term or limited assignments, the Seimas may form standing<lb/> commissions to examine special problems or to form ad hoc investigatory, control, revision,<lb/> preparatory, editorial and other commissions to examine and prepare, or fulfill, another mission of<lb/> the Seimas. In practice, some duplication appears to exist between parliamentary committees<lb/> and commissions.<lb/> In Slovenia, the National Assembly may order inquiries on matters of public importance when<lb/> required by a third of the deputies of the National Assembly or when required by the National<lb/> Council. For this purpose, it appoints a commission which, for the purpose of investigations and<lb/> examinations, has powers comparable to those of a judge. The National Assembly has<lb/> conducted several parliamentary ad hoc inquiries, including one recent inquiry on company<lb/> mergers.<lb/></p>

			<p>In general, parliaments are addressed, and reports made, by various bodies which conduct<lb/> inquiries in their own field of competence. For example, in Hungary, the State Audit Office 154 and<lb/> the Hungarian Atomic Energy Committee report annually, to parliament.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/> ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE<lb/> This part deals with enforcement and compliance in relation to intellectual property law and<lb/> environmental protection law.<lb/></head>

			<p>Enforcement and compliance are central to effective regulatory management. It would require an<lb/> extensive study to assess the extent to which all legislation in a NMS was enforced or complied<lb/> with. Two areas of law (environment law and intellectual property law) were selected as<lb/> indicators of some general trends. The areas were selected in view of their importance to NMS<lb/> and their economies and because their operation extended over a spread of administrative, civil<lb/> and criminal enforcement and compliance tools.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was widespread recognition in all NMS that effective enforcement depends on adequate<lb/> structures being put in place to achieve it and adequate incentives being put in place to achieve<lb/> compliance.<lb/></p>

			<p>The assessments sought to establish, as regards environment law and intellectual property law:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> What are the general approaches to, or philosophies of, enforcement and compliance,<lb/> •<lb/> Were policies in place for enforcement of, and compliance with, legislation in these fields<lb/> adequately funded?<lb/> •<lb/> Were there any trends towards higher levels of enforcement or compliance?<lb/> •<lb/> What procedures were in place to enable citizens to appeal against administrative or<lb/> judicial decisions?<lb/></p>

			<head>The General Approach to, or Philosophy of, Enforcement and Compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>In all NMS, the stated philosophy was zero tolerance. There was no mention in any country of a<lb/> philosophy of a risk-based, proportionate model of regulation. In view of the limited resources in<lb/> all NMS, the quality of the enforcement and the attention to techniques in compliance vary<lb/> widely, without any discernible patterns, across the ten NMS.<lb/></p>

			<p>A number of countries have developed administrative penalties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Administrative Penalties<lb/></head>

			<p>An administrative penalty arises where a law enforcement officer, in the course of inspection,<lb/> identifies a contravention of a law. He, or she, may request that the infringement be remedied<lb/> within a specified time or that a fine be paid on the spot. In some cases, an infringement may be<lb/> remedied by the undertaking of work by a third party, with the cost of the work undertaken being<lb/> recovered from the person committing the offence.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a trend in Estonia, for example, to prefer administrative remedies to penal sanctions,<lb/> particularly after the improved procedures introduced in the Substitutive Enforcement and<lb/> Penalty Payment Act.<lb/></p>

			<p>An administrative penalty under that Act may be applied if a requirement of an administrative<lb/> authority is not complied with during the term indicated on a warning notice. An administrative<lb/> penalty is considered by officials in Estonia to be more efficient than a penal sanction in<lb/> achieving compliance with environmental laws. A similar approach is adopted in the Czech<lb/> Republic and Slovenia, according to officials in these NMS. Administrative penalties are also<lb/> used in</p>

			<head>Cyprus.<lb/></head>

			<p>Officials in these NMS agree that this approach is more demanding, in terms of time and energy,<lb/> and runs a higher risk of being susceptible to corruption. However, officials interviewed were<lb/> strongly of the view that requiring people who have breached laws to take action to address the<lb/> problems caused is, ultimately, more effective than a criminal prosecution, where outcomes can<lb/> be uncertain.<lb/></p>

			<p>The documenting of enforcement and compliance success varies from one NMS to another. In<lb/> some, information in this field is more transparent than in others.<lb/></p>

			<table>In Malta, reports published by the Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) set out priorities<lb/> of the subsequent years. For example, the Enforcement Complaints and Compliance Section<lb/> (ECCS) 155 prioritises removing large quantities of signs and billboards that were placed without<lb/> permission and were unsightly. Priority was also given to cleaning up or removing scrap yards,<lb/> and hundreds of tons of rubble and scrap material were deposited in facilities for recycling.<lb/> In Poland, for example, the Chief Inspector for Environmental Protection publishes an annual<lb/> report entitled &apos;General Directions in Activities of Environmental Protection Inspection&apos;. The report<lb/> sets out priorities for enforcement activities, e.g., inspections on types of business activities or<lb/> different types of legislation to be prioritised for inspections. On the basis of this report, each<lb/> Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection prepares a detailed annual enforcement<lb/> plan. Similar information is available (but is unpublished) in Slovenia and the Inspectorate for<lb/> Environment and Spatial Planning has an annual plan prioritising areas for targeted surveillance<lb/> and enforcement of particular legislation.<lb/> Are policies in place for enforcement of, and compliance with, environmental legislation<lb/> and are intellectual property rights adequately funded and resourced?<lb/> All NMS indicated difficulties with having enough resources to deal with all contraventions.<lb/> Particular difficulties were reported in Cyprus and Slovenia. In the former, officials in the Ministry<lb/> of the Environment indicated that substantial energies and resources had been put into<lb/> incorporating the acquis communautaire into Cyprus law, leaving little human or financial<lb/> resources for inspections and enforcement 156 .<lb/></table>

			<p>In Lithuania, statistical data on the numbers of inspectors does not enable a complete picture to<lb/> be drawn of the capacity of the administration to enforce all of the legislation. However,<lb/> comments by officials in the field of environment law suggested that some capacity building will<lb/> be necessary to bring the numbers of inspectors up to full strength.<lb/> Many of the wrongful consequences of breaches of intellectual property law are, however,<lb/> identified by commercial bodies whose interests are directly affected by breaches. These bodies<lb/> often have the resources to take civil actions. In some types of action, such as actions against<lb/> breaches of copyright, persons not well placed to take legal action may benefit from involvement<lb/> with collection societies, who are better placed to take collective action on behalf of their<lb/> members.<lb/></p>

			<head>Are there any Trends towards Higher Levels of Enforcement or Compliance?<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS reported improvements in enforcement. Reports from environmental protection bodies<lb/> provide some data but comparisons are difficult, as data is collected for different reasons in<lb/> different NMS.<lb/></p>

			<p>Enforcement performance may differ within an individual NMS, depending on the sector<lb/> considered, may derive from the fact that enforcement mechanisms are usually not standardised<lb/> within a NMS.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Czech Republic, a report prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, reviewing all inspection<lb/> arrangements for a wide range of laws, identified shortcomings of the legislation on inspection,<lb/> including overlapping mechanisms and inconsistencies of terminology used. Currently, several<lb/> hundreds Acts regulate the inspection procedures carried out by public administration authorities.<lb/> The Ministry of the Interior launched a project to simplify and unify the system of control in the<lb/> Czech Republic and to increase its transparency for the general public. This should be achieved<lb/> through the adoption of a unique regulation which would replace all the existing regulations. The<lb/> Ministry of the Interior is preparing a substantial proposal for the above-mentioned act and plans<lb/> to submit it to the Government in April 2007.<lb/> In Lithuania, comments from industry sources suggest difficulties in the interpretation of some<lb/> environmental regulations,<lb/> In Malta, each Ministry or enforcing body may have its own mechanism to ensure compliance<lb/> with laws. This may not be automatically detrimental to the level of enforcement; however, it may<lb/> contribute to its reduction.<lb/></p>

			<p>Weak enforcement may also be linked to the fact that enforcement authorities are granted<lb/> insufficient, or inappropriate, powers. In this regard, the situation varies from one NMS to the<lb/> other.<lb/></p>

			<p>Barriers to enforcement may result from the law itself or the way it is applied and interpreted. In<lb/> Cyprus, the interpretation by the judiciary of burden-of-proof rules as to copyright ownership<lb/> makes the initiation of legal proceedings against infringers very difficult.<lb/></p>

			<head>Annual Reports<lb/></head>

			<p>The documenting of enforcement and compliance success varies from one NMS to another.<lb/> In Malta, the Environment and Planning Authority reports that the Enforcement Complaints and<lb/> Compliance Section (ECCS) 157 dealt with 3705 complaints in the period covered by the 2005<lb/> Report. Of these complaints, 3524 were replied to and, from these, 391 cases were resolved<lb/> without need for an enforcement action. The ECCS monitored building developments so that<lb/> infringements could be acted on at the construction stage of building projects. In a small number<lb/> of cases, prosecutions were necessary but, in the majority of cases, a visit from the ECCS was<lb/> sufficient to address problems.<lb/> In Poland, the annual report of the Chief Inspector for the Environment provides some<lb/> information about enforcement, including the number of companies inspected in a particular year,<lb/> the number of inspections and the number of decisions taken suspending the operation of an<lb/> installation, due to infringements by that installation of environmental law.<lb/></p>

			<head>Watch Lists<lb/></head>

			<p>One definite objective measure of improvement may be gleaned from the Office of the United<lb/> States Trade Representative. It publishes an annual report on intellectual property compliance,<lb/></p>

			<table>157<lb/> See annual report for Malta Environment and Planning Report and Accounts 2005 p. 36 [www.mepa.org.mt].<lb/> which includes a priority Watch List. There is a second list the Watch List of countries that do not<lb/> provide an adequate level of IPR protection or enforcement, or market access for persons relying<lb/> on intellectual property protection 158 . The Slovak Republic was dropped from this list in 2005.<lb/> However, some NMS remain on the list. Hungary remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite<lb/> the recognition by the U.S. authorities of the recent enactment of intellectual property<lb/> enforcement legislation. There has undoubtedly been progress in this field in Hungary in recent<lb/> years. Hungary was moved from Priority Watch List to Watch List in 2003. Positive steps have<lb/> been taken in Hungary to modernise its copyright code, but poor enforcement of these laws,<lb/> delays in bringing prosecutions, low fines, weak sentences and weak border enforcement remain<lb/> a source of concern acknowledged by the authorities in Hungary.<lb/> Latvia also remained on the Watch List for 2006, despite the fact that it has improved<lb/> enforcement, among other things, by improving co-ordination between ministries and<lb/> enforcement authorities. There has been an increase in prosecutions, but low fines and prison<lb/> sentences are not acting as a sufficient deterrent to prevent infringements. Border controls<lb/> remain weak and internet piracy remains a problem.<lb/> Lithuania also remains on the list for 2006. It has improved its legislative framework for<lb/> protecting IPR and in combating software piracy. However, optical media piracy levels remain<lb/> high.<lb/> Poland also faces challenges from increasing software piracy. It remains on the Watch List for<lb/> 2006. There were an increased number of raids in 2005 to seize pirated software but the<lb/> imposition by the courts of low fines and short prison sentences appears not to have created a<lb/> sufficient disincentive to continued infringements.<lb/></table>

			<head>Appeal Processes<lb/></head>

			<p>Enforcement can be delayed by lengthy appeal processes. All NMS have appeals processes in<lb/> place but no effort has been made in any country to provide for accelerated appeal processes in<lb/> cases of exceptional public interest. Delays in court hearings in some countries, notably in</p>

			<figure>Malta,<lb/> the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, need to be addressed by increasing capacity and reviewing<lb/> procedures to ascertain if improvements can be brought about by more streamlined processes.<lb/> Decisions made by public authorities in the field of environmental law may be challenged in all<lb/> NMS. In many NMS, including, the Czech Republic, Malta, Poland and Slovenia, individuals<lb/> may first request the relevant authority to review the challenged decision before starting an<lb/> appeals procedure before a court.<lb/> In Poland, decisions relating to intellectual property rights may be appealed either before an<lb/> administrative court or a civil court. The 2000 Law on Industrial Property provides for a right of<lb/> action in an administrative court, where an appeal against a decision of the Patent Office to the<lb/> Regional Administrative Court may be filed. In addition, apart from the rights stipulated in the<lb/> copyright law and the law of industrial property, an injured person is granted the right to file a<lb/> claim for civil rights protection as provided for in the Civil Code.<lb/> Some NMS have nominated special bodies or procedures to appeal against a decision related to<lb/> intellectual property rights. In the Slovak Republic, where a decision of the Industrial Property<lb/> Office may be challenged, following a two-stage process. In the first stage, objections raised by<lb/> third parties against the recognition of a trade mark are assessed and decided upon by the<lb/> 158<lb/> These reports are prepared under section 182 of the Trade Act 1974 (US) as amended including the Uruguay Round<lb/> Agreements Act (1994) (&apos;Special 301</figure>

			<p>). Under special 301 provisions USTR must identify those countries that deny adequate<lb/> and effective protection for IPR or deny equitable and fair market access for persons that rely on intellectual property<lb/> protection.<lb/> Office. In the second stage, third parties who object to the decision may lodge an appeal before<lb/> the appeals department of the Office. The final decision is signed by the head of the Office upon<lb/> a decision of an independent Committee consisting of 5 members (3 from the academic world<lb/> and 2 from the appeals department of the Office).<lb/></p>

			<head>Extra-judicial Mechanisms of Recourse<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS have established extra-judicial mechanisms of recourse, including the establishment of<lb/> ombudsmen and of bodies in charge of consumer claims.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ombudsmen have been established in all NMS and usually have similar responsibilities. In<lb/> Cyprus, for example, citizens may challenge administrative decisions by an appeal to the<lb/> Ombudsman&apos;s Office. In addition, mechanisms for dispute resolution, including SOLVIT centres<lb/> and arbitration mechanisms, have been set up in some NMS.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In Malta, consumers have an option to go to the Consumer Forum or the Consumer Claims<lb/> Tribunal for purchases made by consumers of up to 1500 Lira. There is scarce data on<lb/> enforcement. However, a survey conducted by the Council of Consumers revealed that many<lb/> decisions delivered by the Consumer Claims Tribunal are not enforced. Also in Malta, mandatory<lb/> arbitration was recently developed for claims of creditors of below 5000 Lira, resulting in an<lb/> important reduction in the number of cases before the courts. Since August 2005, 500 claims<lb/> have been made under such a procedure.<lb/> In the Slovak Republic, a Law on Mediation was adopted in September 2004. Following the<lb/> 2004 amendment of the Act on Bankruptcy, a significant flexibility has been introduced to<lb/> bankruptcy proceedings.<lb/> In Slovenia, the 2005 National Reform Programme identifies the need to improve the functioning<lb/> of the judicial system. The measures proposed include: simplification of procedures,<lb/> computerisation of courts and the re-organisation of the management of the courts.<lb/></figure>

			<head>7.<lb/> CONCLUSIONS<lb/> General<lb/></head>

			<p>The NMS reviewed during this study are, geographically, a very diverse group of countries. They<lb/> range from small islands in the Mediterranean to states that have recently moved from central<lb/> planning structures to free market economies. All adopted the acquis communautaire in a<lb/> remarkably short period of time and many have seen accelerated and far reaching changes to<lb/> their systems of governance. Now that they are members of the EU, they all face, to differing<lb/> degrees, the challenge of ensuring that the laws which were adopted as part of the accession<lb/> process are enforced or complied with and that future amendments to the acquis communautaire<lb/> are adopted and implemented in a timely manner.<lb/> Many NMS face pressing domestic issues, some of which are beyond the remit of the European<lb/> Union. These issues include: balancing expectations of state support for welfare and pension<lb/> policies against the harsh reality of having to fund them from taxation, maintaining<lb/> competitiveness, dealing with the challenges posed by unemployment and emigration of talent<lb/> and addressing the rights of minorities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>As regards regulatory management, all of the NMS have transparent and efficient systems for<lb/> planning the execution of policy choices, for the development of policies and their implementation<lb/> into legislation. All have Better Regulation-type policies, with some having an explicit Better<lb/> Regulation policy (Czech Republic, Malta and Poland), while others have an implicit Better<lb/> Regulation policy.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Political support is a critical success factor for the development and implementation of improved<lb/> governance practices, such as the adoption of a Better Regulation policy. In some NMS (Cyprus,<lb/> Malta,Poland, Slovenia), political support was clearly visible in the form of participation by<lb/> ministers in conferences on Better Regulation, speaking knowledgeably about the subject.<lb/> However, in the other NMS, political support was less tangible, though references to Better<lb/> Regulation issues may be found in all NMS in strategic plans and political documents of one kind<lb/> or another. These references have to be treated with caution, as many of these documents set<lb/> out ideals and ambitions as much as they set out realistic and deliverable goals.<lb/></p>

			<p>Any policy development in states formerly under communist influence has to take its place<lb/> alongside a large number of other pressing political issues. In the period up to, and immediately<lb/> after, European integration, anything which was associated with accession was likely to be<lb/> prioritised and accelerated. In the post-accession period, it is by no means certain that this will<lb/> remain the case.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulatory Management Capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>For the most part, in NMS, there is a sense that regulatory management works quite well and<lb/> sophisticated and abstract fine-tuning through the development of Better Regulation is not an<lb/> issue likely to attract voter attention or sustained political interest. It will, therefore, be a challenge<lb/> to sustain interest in it. The reduction of red tape and the reduction of administrative burdens are<lb/> issues that may get some attention, due to their obvious iconic value. However, these issues are<lb/> competing with a wide range of other challenges and, inevitably, require some investment of time<lb/> and money. The argument that Better Regulation policy is an investment in the infrastructure of<lb/> governance requires skilful advocacy and a degree of political vision which is not clearly visible in<lb/> most NMS.<lb/></p>

			<p>The biggest capacity challenge facing all NMS in the development and maintenance of policies to<lb/> improve governance will be to either keep existing officials in place or to develop structures which<lb/> provide for continuity. In all NMS, the fire for regulatory management improvement is kept alive<lb/> by a small number of high priests. If they are promoted, or move on, the challenge will be to put<lb/> in place other officials to deliver on the reforms that were seen being developed during the<lb/> reviews.<lb/></p>

			<head>Quality Control<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS have put in place regulatory management practices to assure the quality of their<lb/> legislation before it is submitted to government for approval and parliament for enactment.<lb/> However, the practices tend to concentrate exclusively on whether the law has achieved the<lb/> relevant political objectives and on technical, legal issues, such as conformity with the<lb/> Constitution, compliance with the general principles of law and with international obligations.<lb/> These are important goals; however, most NMS neglect to put in place a review from the point of<lb/> view of whether the proposed legislation conforms to Better Regulation principles or whether the<lb/> tools used in their preparation (impact assessment or consultation) have been properly used.<lb/> Some NMS are beginning to address issues associated with ensuring the administrative costs<lb/> are kept to a minimum.<lb/></p>

			<head>Use of Better Regulation Tools<lb/></head>

			<p>In most NMS, there are laws which require impact assessment to be undertaken. However, most<lb/> of these laws were enacted without putting in place the necessary skills or support structures<lb/> and, up until recently; there was no real commitment to their operation. Consequentially, there<lb/> are formal mechanisms in place but they are frequently ignored. A number of NMS</p>

			<figure>(Czech<lb/> Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia) are aware of this problem and<lb/> are addressing it.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Enactment<lb/></head>

			<p>All NMS have effective and fully-functioning democratic institutions and many are relatively<lb/> well-resourced. However, in most NMS, the legislative branch of government is dominated by the<lb/> executive. In a few,</p>

			<table>however (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic),<lb/> parliament plays a dynamic, though not always effective, role in legislating and proposing<lb/> amendments.<lb/></table>

			<head>Enforcement and Compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>Enforcement and compliance is not an area which has received much attention in the context of<lb/> regulatory reform studies or as part of Better Regulation initiatives. As well as providing a general<lb/> overview of enforcement and compliance in these areas in the NMS, the assessments threw up<lb/> some fundamental questions that could be usefully studied in the EU as a whole:<lb/> •<lb/> Should the philosophy of enforcement and compliance be zero tolerance, i.e., that every<lb/> offence, no matter how trivial, be prosecuted or should penalty systems be more in the<lb/> line of a risk-based proportionate model of regulation?<lb/> •<lb/> Are administrative sanctions more effective than penal sanctions and in what<lb/> circumstances are they more effective?<lb/> •<lb/> What are the most effective sanctions for particular types of offence?<lb/> •<lb/> What are the best incentives to secure increased levels of compliance?<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Should statistical data on compliance and enforcement issues be compiled by<lb/> governments in the EU in a manner which facilitates comparisons between EU Member<lb/> States?<lb/></p>

			<head>Recommendations Common to all NMS<lb/> 1.<lb/> Political support needs to be developed to maintain a policy on Better Regulation<lb/></head>

			<p>Political support is essential for the development of regulatory management capacities so that<lb/> strategic goals are set to achieve good governance by regulating better. Political support needs<lb/> to be more substantive than a few carefully drafted phrases in political manifestoes or national<lb/> plans. It must be genuine and based on a personal commitment of a senior political figure to<lb/> delivering improvements in governance that will ensure that the regulation of their societies and<lb/> economies, and the protection of the environment, is undertaken in a manner which is<lb/> proportionate to the problems experienced, is transparent and deals with issues without having<lb/> unintended consequences. Better Regulation Units can facilitate this process through holding<lb/> seminars and encouraging debate about Better Regulation issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> A policy to achieve Better Regulation works best when there are appropriate and<lb/> adequately-funded arrangements in place to support and maintain it<lb/></head>

			<p>Appropriate institutional arrangements need to be put in place to ensure that the quality of<lb/> policy-making and legislation drafting is tested against a set of agreed objective principles<lb/> designed, and agreed to improve, regulatory management. In all NMS, legislation is rigorously<lb/> reviewed from the point of view of legality, constitutionality, and consistency with the general<lb/> principles of law and conformity with international obligations. These are important requirements<lb/> but are not enough to address the complexities of the problems thrown up by the modern world.<lb/> A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to ensure policy choices are well made and, as<lb/> appropriate, expressed in legislative instruments that meet a test of efficiency as well as the<lb/> traditional test of legal effectiveness.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Regulatory management capacities may be developed through the effective use of<lb/> Better Regulation tools<lb/></head>

			<p>Better regulation tools need to be widely used in a proportionate manner by all institutions<lb/> (executive and legislative branches of government and independent regulators) concerned. The<lb/> issue of proportionality is of particular concern as regards impact assessment. All NMS have<lb/> enacted laws to require the use of impact assessment for all policy proposals.<lb/></p>

			<p>These are most likely to be successful when full impact assessments, using quantitative<lb/> techniques and trained economists, are used for major policy proposals involving substantial<lb/> impacts. For smaller impacts, what is required is an educated sense by officials of what is<lb/> involved and what the likely costs are going to be for a particular proposal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consultation practices need to be developed to ensure that the collective knowledge of society is<lb/> drawn on, in the development of new laws.<lb/> Measurement of administrative costs may be undertaken, but it should not be a distraction from<lb/> the wider goals of making legislation as simple as possible and as easy to comply with as<lb/> possible, with the minimum of burdens and duplicated efforts.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of these tools should facilitate the development of a multi-disciplinary approach to<lb/> policy — making and the slow evolution away from the monopolistic control by lawyers of the<lb/> review of the quality of legislation towards the development of legislation that is not only legally<lb/> effective but efficient.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> Executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a<lb/> constructive way to ensure wise governance<lb/></head>

			<p>The executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate in a constructive way to<lb/> ensure wise governance.</p>

			<head>Legislatures in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak<lb/></head>

			<p>Republic tend to make legislative proposals and put forward amendments to legislation that do<lb/> not take into account the longer-term issues. While these are exclusively matters for the NMS<lb/> concerned, it is nevertheless important to draw attention to the need for this cooperation.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> More attention needs to be paid to enforcement and compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>There are substantial developments taking place in the European Union as regards<lb/> administrative costs measurement, simplification and impact assessment. However, the next<lb/> challenge to face the European Union will be to ensure consistent application of European law<lb/> across the EU. The NMS, having recently adopted the acquis communautaire, now face the<lb/> challenge of its effective implementation. How these NMS meet this challenge may well provide<lb/> inspiration and guidance to states that joined the European Union before the 1 st of May 2004, as<lb/> well as to those that will join next.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ANNEX 1: GLOSSARY OF TERMS FOR THE PROJECT TO ASSESS<lb/> REGULATORY CAPACITIES<lb/> &apos;acquis&apos; (or acquis communautaire) means in European Union the total body of European Union<lb/> law accumulated so far. When used in the context of enlargement and accession of NMS to the<lb/> Union, the expression refers to the whole corpus of Community law which NMS have to take<lb/> over, including:<lb/> •<lb/> The Treaties;<lb/> •<lb/> The decisions taken by the EU Institutions pursuant to the Treaties;<lb/> •<lb/> The case law of the Court of Justice.<lb/> &apos;Administrative burdens of regulation&apos; means the costs involved</figure>

			<p>in obtaining, reading and<lb/> understanding regulations, developing compliance strategies and meeting mandated reporting<lb/> requirements, including data collection, processing, reporting and storage, but NOT including the<lb/> capital costs of measures taken to comply with the regulations, nor the costs to the public sector<lb/> of administering the regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>&apos;Administrative costs&apos; within the EU institutions means the costs incurred by enterprises</head>

			<p>, the<lb/> voluntary sector, public authorities and citizens in meeting legal obligations to provide information<lb/> on their action or production, either to public authorities or to private parties. Information is to be<lb/> construed in a broad sense, i.e. including costs of labelling, reporting, monitoring and<lb/> assessment needed to provide the information and registration. They are a subset of compliance<lb/> costs stemming from the generic requirements of the legislation, which also includes substantive<lb/> costs one-off investments in new production processes, training or increased recurring costs for<lb/> raw materials and labour (excluding administrative).<lb/></p>

			<figure>&apos;Administrative compliance costs&apos; has the same meaning as administrative burdens of<lb/> regulation.<lb/> &apos;Advisory Groups&apos; means selected experts or interested parties (e.g., social partners,<lb/> environmental groups) who are brought together to form a consultative body, either on an ad hoc<lb/> or a standing basis.<lb/> &apos;Alternative policy instruments&apos; have the same meaning as regulatory alternatives.<lb/></figure>

			<p>&apos;Alternative to regulations&apos; means any instruments other than command and control regulation<lb/> used with the purpose of obtaining policy goals and including policy instruments such as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>•<lb/></formula>

			<table>performance based regulation;<lb/> •<lb/> process regulation;<lb/> •<lb/> waiver or variance provisions;<lb/> •<lb/> co-regulation;<lb/> •<lb/> self-regulation;<lb/> •<lb/> contractual arrangements;<lb/> •<lb/> voluntary agreements;<lb/> •<lb/> tradeable permits;<lb/> •<lb/> taxes and subsidies;<lb/> •<lb/> insurance schemes or information campaigns.<lb/></table>

			<p>&apos;Baseline&apos; is a minimum or starting point for comparisons; in this case, it is a minimum set of<lb/> criteria drawn up by SIGMA, in consultation with the European Commission, for the purpose of<lb/> this project.<lb/></p>

			<head>&apos;Better Regulation, Regulatory Management, Better Regulation and Smarter Regulation&apos;<lb/></head>

			<p>are the terms which are increasingly being used to convey the concept of an ongoing<lb/> commitment to improving the processes of policy formulation, legislative drafting and enhancing<lb/> the overall effectiveness and coherence of regulation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Better Regulation</head>

			<p>means a policy to improve regulatory management capacities by adopting a<lb/> multidisciplinary approach to formulating policy and drafting regulations and using tools such as<lb/> impact assessment consultation and simplification. It applies to the flow of new regulations and<lb/> the stock of existing regulations. It is closely related to but goes beyond regulatory reform which<lb/> is concerned with reforming regulations so that they operate efficiently. Better Regulation policy<lb/> is designed to ensure that existing and future legislation is of high quality, i.e., that it is clear,<lb/> concise and used only when its burdens are proportionate to its aims.<lb/></p>

			<p>&apos;Consumer&apos; and &apos;citizen&apos; are frequently used and it is important to note that these are not<lb/> interchangeable terms. The term &apos;consumer&apos; is meant to refer to individuals when they are<lb/> participating in the marketplace and consuming particular goods and services. It can also refer to<lb/> businesses, often the initial customers in particular sectors. The concept of a &apos;citizen&apos; is broader<lb/> and refers to the relationship between individuals and the State (without being used in any strict<lb/> legal sense to denote nationality). There are circumstances where the State is a producer or<lb/> supplier of a particular good or service to citizens. In this context citizens can be viewed as<lb/> consumers of the State 159 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The idea of &apos;Better Regulation&apos; also helps to draw an important distinction between the wide<lb/> reform agenda and deregulation. It is accepted that in some cases consumer, investor and the<lb/> broader public interest may be better served by introducing new regulation and that in other<lb/> cases it may be better served by removing regulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>No initial assumption is being made about either the existing quality or quantity of regulation or<lb/> the need to deregulate. Instead, it is suggested that the goal of Better Regulation will not be<lb/> achieved by simply seeking to minimise the volume of regulation but rather by using measures<lb/> that are as simple and straightforward as possible while achieving the same policy objectives.<lb/></p>

			<p>&apos;Capacity&apos; means the ability to perform appropriate tasks effectively, efficiently and<lb/> systematically in a timely manner.<lb/></p>

			<figure>&apos;Circulation of proposals for comment&apos; means the process whereby information on regulatory<lb/> proposals is circulated to a selected group of experts or interested parties for comment.<lb/> &apos;Codification&apos; means the systematic arrangement of laws in force.<lb/></figure>

			<head>&apos;Command and Control regulations&apos; means regulations</head>

			<p>that use the traditional approach of<lb/> imposing a sanction, typically a fine or imprisonment or both, for failure to comply with an<lb/> obligation.<lb/></p>

			<head>&apos;Regulatory Reform&apos; means changes</head>

			<p>that improve regulatory quality, that is, enhance the<lb/> performance, cost-effectiveness, or legal quality of regulation and formalities.<lb/> &apos;Secondary regulation&apos; means regulation which can be made by a person (a Minister) or a body<lb/> (an independent local authority).<lb/></p>

			<head>&apos;SIGMA&apos; (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management in Central and Eastern<lb/></head>

			<p>European Countries) means the joint OECD/EU initiative launched in 1992, coordinated and<lb/> principally financed by the European Commission which aims, amongst other objectives, at<lb/> assisting the new EU Member states and candidate countries in modernising and strengthening<lb/> their policy-making capacities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>&apos;Soft law&apos; means administrative circulars and administrative discretion.<lb/> &apos;Sunsetting&apos; means the automatic repeal of regulations a certain number of years after they<lb/> have come into force. This will usually trigger a review of the regulation just before repeal occurs.<lb/></figure>

			<p>1. Effective regulatory management requires planning in the form of a general strategy to achieve<lb/> the political, economic, environmental and social goals of government as well as tactical planning<lb/> to deal with the day – to – day implementation of government programmes and the effective<lb/> negotiation, enactment and implementation of EU policies. The planning process should show<lb/> evidence of a capacity to set goals and a capacity to ensure that goals, once set, are achievable<lb/> and achieved.<lb/> 2. The capacity of the agenda setting process needs to be demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> Descriptions of the process.<lb/> •<lb/> Published plans such as government or coalition programmes.<lb/> •<lb/> Administrative structures.<lb/> •<lb/> An appropriate number of suitably qualified personnel.<lb/> •<lb/> Reports or other indicators that agreed outcomes in specified periods were achieved.<lb/> •<lb/> A capacity to ensure compliance with agendas once set.<lb/></p>

			<head>C.<lb/> Policy formulation and regulation drafting process<lb/></head>

			<p>1. Inherent in regulatory management is the process of formulating policy and articulating it in the<lb/> form of regulations. Regulatory quality is a function of the people and processes involved in the<lb/> analysis of problems, the design of regulatory solutions, the composition of regulations, the<lb/> quality assurance of regulation, the implementation of, or compliance with, regulations and the<lb/> review of regulations once put in place. Good regulatory management is a function of the policies<lb/> (explicit policies on regulatory management and policies as regards each sector), tools<lb/> (consultation, regulatory impact assessment, use of alternatives to traditional command and<lb/> control regulation) and institutions involved in the process.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. The capacity of the policy formulation and regulation drafting process needs to be<lb/> demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> A transparent process articulated by law or set out in check lists, for analysis of<lb/> problems and decision making or similar guidelines.<lb/> •<lb/> Appropriate structures for the analysis of policy issues and their resolution by regulatory<lb/> or other means.<lb/> •<lb/> Appropriate tools such as regulatory impact analysis tools.<lb/> •<lb/> An appropriate number of suitably trained personnel as regards particular areas of policy<lb/> formulation and regulation drafting.<lb/> •<lb/> As regards EU measures, processes and personnel for the analysis of proposals and<lb/> the enactment and implementation of EU policy.<lb/> •<lb/> Appropriately designed and managed consultation processes, regulatory impact<lb/> assessment tools and a variety of regulatory implementation tools including alternatives<lb/> to traditional command and control regulatory tools.<lb/></p>

			<head>D.<lb/> Quality assurance process<lb/></head>

			<p>1. Good regulatory management requires a built in quality assurance process that validates<lb/> regulations against good regulation principles such as:<lb/> •<lb/> Constitutionality and conformity with general principles of law including EU law and<lb/> policy.<lb/> •<lb/> Consistency within the regulation.<lb/> •<lb/> Consistency with other regulations, government and EU policy generally.<lb/> •<lb/> Proportionality.<lb/> •<lb/> Clarity.<lb/> •<lb/> Accessibility.<lb/> •<lb/> Effectiveness not only as regards the achievement of stated policy objectives but also<lb/> from the point of view of minimising &quot; red tape &quot; and burdens particularly burdens on small<lb/> to medium enterprises (SME&apos;s).<lb/> •<lb/> Conformity with budgetary policy.<lb/> •<lb/> Economic, environmental and social impact (including impact on small to medium<lb/> enterprises).<lb/> •<lb/> Efficiency and effectiveness (as regards practicability and implementation).<lb/> •<lb/> Transparency and non discrimination.<lb/> •<lb/> Adequacy of resources to achieve particular objectives.<lb/> •<lb/> Powers to enforce quality standards.<lb/> •<lb/> Administrative burdens and reduction of red tape.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. The quality assurance process needs to function horizontally as regards the implementation of<lb/> an overarching policy on regulatory management and vertically within each body responsible for<lb/> making regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. The capacity of the policy formulation and regulation drafting process needs to be<lb/> demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></head>

			<p>•<lb/> An institution or set of equivalent arrangements for quality assurance, horizontally<lb/> across the whole of Government and vertically in respect of each regulation making<lb/> body.<lb/> •<lb/> Published or ascertainable norms of regulatory quality.<lb/> •<lb/> Procedures for quality review.<lb/> •<lb/> A sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel.<lb/> •<lb/> Reports on the quality assurance process (internal) prepared by the bodies themselves<lb/> or by parliamentary committees or academic commentators.<lb/> •<lb/> Practices and procedures to deal with failures to achieve high quality regulation in<lb/> accordance with agreed norms.<lb/></p>

			<head>E.<lb/> Enactment<lb/></head>

			<p>1. To achieve effective regulatory management there should be enacted a specific law as<lb/> regards regulatory quality management which prescribes regulatory norms.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. Enactment is central to the regulatory management process whether it be by a parliament<lb/> (primary legislation) or a delegated body (delegated legislation). The enactment process typically<lb/> involves some kind of review of policy issues and quality review of the regulations. It is<lb/> unnecessary to review the existence of such institutions and would be inappropriate to give a<lb/> qualitative analysis of them. However, a useful indicator of the potential capacity of enactment<lb/> institutions may be determined from a review of the existence and extent of research, secretarial<lb/> and library facilities available to legislators.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. The capacity of the enactment process needs to be demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> An institution or set of equivalent arrangements for quality assurance.<lb/> •<lb/> Published or ascertainable norms of regulatory quality.<lb/> •<lb/> Procedures for quality review.<lb/> •<lb/> A sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel.<lb/> •<lb/> Reports on the quality assurance process (internal) prepared by the bodies themselves<lb/> or by parliamentary committees or academic commentators.<lb/></p>

			<head>F.<lb/> Compliance and enforcement of regulations<lb/></head>

			<p>1. The formulation and making of regulations is the initial part of the regulatory process. In order<lb/> to be effective regulations need to be complied with or compliance with them must be enforced. It<lb/> would require an extensive study to assess the total capacity to ensure compliance or<lb/> enforcement of regulations. Consequentially, two areas are selected as indicators: intellectual<lb/> property regulations and environment protection regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. The capacity of the enactment process needs to be demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></head>

			<p>•<lb/> The accessibility of the relevant regulatory regimes and the extent to which explanatory<lb/> materials are available to make the regulatory requirements known.<lb/> •<lb/> Reports (internal or external) indicating the extent to which the regulatory regimes are<lb/> effective measured against subjective government self assessments of effectiveness or<lb/> objective assessments undertaken by academic commentators, consumer, commercial<lb/> and environmental interest groups.<lb/> •<lb/> The availability of a sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel to undertake<lb/> inspections, ascertain levels of compliance and secure enforcement.<lb/></p>

			<head>G.<lb/> Review<lb/></head>

			<p>1. An essential characteristic of regulatory management is the extent to which regulations, once<lb/> put in place, are reviewed from the point of view of effectiveness and relevance.<lb/> 2. The capacity of the regulatory review process needs to be demonstrated by reference to:<lb/></p>

			<p>•<lb/> The existence of review processes (general and particular) for review evidenced by<lb/> institutional arrangements and reports or the proceedings of those institutions.<lb/> •<lb/> The availability of a sufficient number of appropriately qualified personnel to undertake<lb/> inspections, ascertain levels of compliance and secure enforcement.<lb/> •<lb/> Evidence of co-operation with international bodies whether by participating in peer<lb/> reviews or otherwise.<lb/></p>
