            <figDesc>Teacher professional development is deemed to be high quality when it includes opportunities for active<lb/> learning methods, an extended time period, a group of colleagues, and collective learning activities<lb/> or research with other teachers. The higher the exposure of teachers to high-quality professional<lb/> development, the more likely they are to use a wide variety of teaching practices in the classroom.<lb/> • Professional development activities that focus on curriculum knowledge (rather than subject knowledge<lb/> or pedagogy) and that involve collaborating with other teachers seem particularly well suited to<lb/> enhancing teachers&apos; classroom practices. However, these types of professional development are not<lb/> those that are most widely used around the world.<lb/> • Not all teachers have equal access to high-quality professional development. In some countries and<lb/> economies, different participation rates in high-quality professional development are observed between<lb/> male and female teachers, as well as between teachers who have and have not completed initial teacher<lb/> education.</figDesc>
