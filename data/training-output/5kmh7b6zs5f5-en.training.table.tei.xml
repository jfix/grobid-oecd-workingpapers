            <figDesc>&quot; However despite these gains, it appears that the structural problems with this market have remained<lb/> intact. While voice roaming services may be an important source of revenues and profits for a mobile<lb/> operator, from the point of view of consumers prices for voice roaming are perceived as prices for only<lb/> one element of a larger mobile bundle purchased – and as a less important element of this bundle than,<lb/> say, domestic voice, domestic SMS or a (subsidized) mobile device included in the mobile price plan &quot; .</figDesc>

No clear evidence<lb/> of elasticity was found by the ERG benchmark data report 100 regarding the period April 2007 to September<lb/> 2008: &quot; A direct comparison of the developments in the volumes of regulated voice services and<lb/> unregulated SMS services (for which prices have remained static) reveals a very similar trend. It is not<lb/> clear how to interpret this and ERG is reluctant to draw definitive conclusions at this stage. It could imply<lb/> that the assumption that some had made that price reductions would stimulate large increases in volumes<lb/> does not hold water. On the other hand, the rise in SMS roaming volumes could also be seen as a natural<lb/> consequence of the still increasing domestic SMS volumes in many member states &quot; .
