CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM by Andrew Parry, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), UK, 
Paul Bleazard, DEFRA, UK 
and 
Koki Okawa, OECD This report contains case studies of food loss and waste policy practices in Japan and the 
United Kingdom. The Japanese case study examines the goals, measurements, achievements 
and future challenges of the country's food loss and waste policies. The Japanese government 
has implemented policies to suppress and recycle food loss and waste since 2000 under its 
Food Recycling Law. The control of food waste generation is based on a specific target for 
each industry group, in order to address differences in the scope for loss and waste reduction 
across sectors. While food waste in the food industry has been reduced, the waste at consumer 
stage has shown no change in recent years, highlighting outstanding challenges at the 
consumer stage. Preventing food waste has been a priority for Governments in the United Kingdom for 
over a decade, and a range of mechanisms have been put in place to deliver this within 
households, hospitality and food service, food manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors. The 
UK case study outlines the policy context within which food waste prevention sits, explains 
how food waste is defined in the United Kingdom, provides detail on the level and types of 
food waste across different sectors, and describes the interventions adopted and their impacts. 
Between 2007 and 2012 household food waste reduced by 15%, despite a 4% increase in 
household numbers, and food waste at manufacture and retail fell by 10% between 2009 and 
2012. There is significant potential to reduce food waste further, however it is likely that this 
will become increasingly challenging Keywords: Food waste, Japan, United Kingdom, Love Food Hate Waste, Courtauld

Waste and Resources Action Programme, United Kingdom 6 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Executive Summary  Two case studies are presented as examples of food loss and waste policy practices in Japan 
and the United Kingdom. They have been prepared by the Government of Japan and 
DEFRA and WRAP in the United Kingdom as a contribution to the OECD's ongoing work 
on market and trade impacts of food loss and waste reduction. 
 Japan is a major food importing country with trade accounting for about 60% of its food 
intake. However, food loss and waste at each stage of the food chain is a serious concern. 
The government has implemented policies to control and recycle food loss and waste since 
2000 under the Food Recycling Law. Section 1 summarises Japan's goals, measurements, 
achievements and future challenges of its food loss and waste policies. 
 In order to monitor these policies, data on food waste in Japan is collected from the food 
manufacturing, wholesaling, retail and catering industries. It is a requirement that all 
business operators with more than 100 tonnes of annual food waste generation report 
annually the status of the generation and recycling of their food wastes. The estimates for 
the entire country are calculated on the basis of those complying with the law, together with 
a sample survey of business operators who generate 100 tonnes or less of waste. Data on 
food waste in the food service industry and households is also collected through other 
statistics. An interesting feature of Japanese statistics is that they estimate the amount that is 
recycled for feed or fertiliser use. 
 The government plans to target the amount of food waste that is to be reduced, and this is a 
priority over reuse and recycling. Following a technical investigation, target value for the 
control of food waste generation were established to cover 26 industry groups for a period 
of five years from April 2014. The indicator  " reference generation unit "  is applied as the 
target value for the control of food waste generation. 
 Food waste resulting from returned goods and excess inventory is difficult for individual 
companies to resolve and should be tackled by the entire food chain. In this regard, the food 
industry in Japan has formed a working group to examine business customs in order to 
reduce food waste and to review delivery deadlines, best before date use standards, and 
labelling methods. These reviews are drawing attention particularly as the extension of 
product expiration dates is expected to improve domestic stockpiles in case of disasters. 
 The measures in Japan summarised in this paper seem effective but concern only the control 
of waste generation and recycling of food waste in the food industry and do not cover food 
loss occurring at the farm level. It should be noted that food waste at the consumer level has 
shown no change in recent years. Looking over the entire food chain, future challenges for 
food loss and waste at each stage of the food value chain are outlined. 
 Preventing food waste has been a priority for Governments in the United Kingdom for over 
a decade, and a range of mechanisms have been put in place to deliver this. Section 2 
outlines the policy context within which food waste prevention sits, explains how food 
waste is defined in the United Kingdom, provides detail on the level and types of food waste 
across different sectors, and describes the interventions adopted and their impacts. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 7 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015  Three major WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme) studies carried out in 
2013 estimated annual food waste arising within households, hospitality and food service, 
food manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors at around 12 Mt, 75% of which could have 
been avoided. Around 90% (by weight) of the avoidable food waste arises in households 
and food manufacture. 
 The primary mechanisms in the United Kingdom for facilitating the reduction in food waste 
are the Courtauld Commitment (CC) and Hospitality and Food Service Agreement 
(HaFSA), both voluntary agreements managed by WRAP, and funded by Westminster, 
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments, and the consumer facing Love Food 
Hate Waste (LFHW) campaign. Based on the experience in the United Kingdom, the 
following factors are highlighted as important for successfully reducing food waste: 
 An evidence based strategy, to identify priorities, build a persuasive case for action, 
develop clear and robust recommendations and inform the development of effective 
messages and materials for engaging with consumers, industry and other stakeholders. 
 An integrated approach, looking across the whole supply chain (recognising the 
influence those at any given stage in the supply chain can have on others in the supply 
chain), and also in terms of householders incorporating three key elements (national / 
large scale awareness raising campaigns, local/community engagement to influence 
behaviours and changes to products, packaging and labelling to make it easier to buy 
the right amounts of food and use what is bought), which if implemented together 
deliver much more than any element in isolation. 
 A framework for action, such as the CC and HaFSA, with collective targets which 
provides a mechanism for sharing best practice and facilitating the uptake of 
recommendations for change. 
 Monitoring and reporting, to assess progress against targets, allow changes in action 
to be made in response to this and to recognise (publically) achievements (show what 
can be done) and benefits of taking action. 
 The chapter concludes by exploring the challenges ahead and implications of reduced food 
waste levels. While the United Kingdom has made positive progress in reducing food waste, 
it is likely that further reduction will become increasingly challenging (for example as the 
 " quick wins "  will have been achieved). Population growth and other economic factors will 
also limit the reduction of food waste. 8 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 FOOD LOSS AND WASTE REDUCTION ACTIVITIES 
IN JAPAN 1.1. 
Background Japan is a major food importing country, importing 60% of its food supply. The food self-
sufficiency rate on a calorie basis is among the lowest of OECD countries. However, Japan's 
culinary culture highly values fresh food, such as sashimi and foods that are in season, and 
this results an excessively freshness-conscious consumer base which, in turn, is thought to 
result in considerable food loss and waste at each stage of the food chain. Since the Food 
Recycling Law was enacted in 2000 under the joint jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), the 
government has introduced policies on the control and recycling of food loss and waste. The 
motivation to fight food loss and waste in Japan is related to lower costs for both consumers 
and producers, but also concerns for the global environment and solidarity with 
underdeveloped nations (Marra, 2013). The present study summarises Japan's goal setting, 
measurements and achievements as well as the future challenges of its food loss and waste 
policies. This section provides an overview of the policies targeting waste in general. Since the 
Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilities of Resources (Recycling Law) and the Basic 
Environmental Law were enacted in 1991 and 1993, respectively, other environmental issues 
have been dealt with separately; for example, by the revision of the Waste Disposal and 
Public Cleansing Law. Nevertheless, a large amount of waste is still generated every year 
which makes it difficult to ensure the waste disposal site, and complicates the waste 
management with problems such as illegal dumping. In order to address such waste and 
recycling problems, by moving away from an economy of  " mass production, mass 
consumption and mass disposal "  and achieving a  " recycling society "  with low environmental 
impacts, the Basic Law for Establishing the Recycling-Based Society was enacted. This law 
provides the framework to promote the formation of a recycling-oriented society and was 
enacted in June 2000 and fully enforced as of January 2001. Comparison of international policy frameworks (Sakai et al., 2011) indicates that the 
major focus of waste management policies changed during the late 20 th and early 
21 st centuries, driven by global environmental problems and concerns about the depletion of 
natural resource. Formerly, the focus was on promoting environmentally-sound waste 
treatment to avoid local environmental pollution, but today policies have shifted to pursue the 
concept of sustainability by introducing and promoting 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) policies. The Basic Law for Establishing the Recycling-Based Society, which is positioned under 
the Basic Environmental Law, has become a central law over and above other individual laws 
on waste and recycling. This legislation defines a recycling-oriented society in which the 
generation of waste from products is controlled, the proper cyclical use of wasted products is 
promoted, the proper disposal of cyclical resources is ensured, and consumption of natural 
resources and environmental stresses are reduced via appropriate measures. It states the 
priority of the process in the order of  " waste reduction " ,  " re-use " ,  " material recycling " , PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 9 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015  " thermal recovery "  and  " proper disposal. "  The concept of extended producer responsibility is 
adopted in the law in the way that a producer assumes certain responsibilities for the disposal 
and recycling of its products, as well as the state measures that define the implementation of 
receipt of products after use, their recycling and the pre-evaluation of products. Various recycling laws were enacted together with the Basic Law, and revisions of the 
Recycling Law and Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Law were also undertaken 
(Figure 1). Newly enacted laws were the Food Recycling Law, Construction Waste Recycling 
Law, Containers and Packaging Recycling Law, Home Appliance Recycling Law, End-of-life 
Vehicle Recycling Law, and the Law on Promoting Green Purchasing. In 2012, a Small 
Electronic Appliance Recycling Law that covers mobile phones and game machines was also 
enacted. Figure 1. Waste Management framework in Japan Source: Sakai et al. (2011). The Food Recycling Law addresses both the reduction of waste, such as processing 
residues from food production, unsold or uneaten foods in the distribution and consumption 
process, and recycling of waste materials to feed and fertiliser uses, etc. These laws are aimed 
at creating a recycling-oriented society with low environmental impact as well as reducing the 
amount of food waste. Food-related businesses in the manufacture, distribution and catering 
sectors are obliged to recycle waste materials, and if their activities are deemed insufficient, 
the government can issue instructions and recommendations, or even publish the name of the 
company. Penalties can be imposed in case government instructions are not obeyed. The Food Recycling Law defines food waste as follows:

in the process of manufacturing processing and cooking The scope of Japanese definition of food waste is different from FAO's and limited to 
manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, caterer and consumer stage. It is assumed that non-edible 
portions of food and by-products are included in Japanese definition of food waste. The Food Recycling Law provides a registration system of recycling operators and a 
certification system for business plans on recycling in order to promote recycling by food-
related businesses. This is the system where operators producing specific feeds and fertilisers 
from recycled food materials can be registered by the Ministry; 180 operators were registered 
nationwide as of March 2014. The registration identifies business operators who undertake 
their recycling business according to government norms, with the goal of cultivating good 
recycling companies. The registration requirements are that the production of feeds and 
fertilisers do not hinder the conservation of the living environment, that the scale and type of 
facilities are appropriate to efficiently implement the business (processing of food resources 
of 5 tonnes or more per day), and that there is a sufficient financial basis for project 
implementation. The advantages of registration are expanded business opportunities owing to 
the publication of their company on a government website, special treatment under the Feed 
Safety Law and Fertiliser Control Act that does not require repetitive notification of sales and 
production of feed and fertiliser, and a special treatment under the Waste Disposal and Public 
Cleansing Law that does not require a work permit for the transportation of municipal solid 
waste in the unloading area (a work permit is required, however, from the municipality in the 
loading area). The certification system of a business plan on recycling, called  " recycling loop " , that uses 
specific feed and fertiliser from recycled food materials can be formulated jointly by 
manufacturers and operators on agriculture, forestry and fishery industries, etc., as a specific 
user, and receive recognition from the respective Ministries. Once the plan is approved, the 
business plan will receive special treatment under the Feed Safety Law, Fertiliser Control Act, 
and the Waste Disposal and Public Cleansing Law. Under this system, food-related businesses 
can expect stable supplies of primary products from agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and 
recycling businesses, and the primary sector may secure customers within the recycling loop. 
In March 2014, there were 52 certified business plans on recycling, consisting of 20 livestock 
feed businesses and 32 fertiliser businesses. For example, vegetables and pork are produced 
using a fertiliser or feed that has been recycled from food. The Food Recycling Law must be 
reviewed for its enforcement status five years after implementation, and take necessary 
measures recommended by the review. In response to this, a committee composed of 
representatives from the MOE and MAFF met in 2006, and the law was amended in 2007. In order to monitor this policy, data on food waste is collected by the food manufacturing, 
wholesaling, retail and catering industries. In response to the legislative changes in 2007, it is 
necessary for the operators with more than 100 tonnes of annual food waste generation to 
report annually the status of generation and recycling of their food wastes. The estimates of 
food waste for the entire country are made from the responses together with a sample survey 
for the operators of 100 tonnes or less. Data on food waste in the food service industry and 
households is collected through other statistics, and the MOE also has other estimates of 
household waste. An interesting feature in Japanese statistics is that it contains the amount 
that is recycled for feed or fertilisers. Recent policies are monitored by these detailed 
statistics, but in the past, the rough estimates of food waste were calculated by taking the 
difference between the intake and the supply amount per capita per day on a calorie basis 
(Box 1). Stuart (2009) proposed to compare the required intake amount per capita for each 
country and the supply amount obtained from FAO's food balance sheets. This enables simple 
international comparison of excessive food intake and food waste. Such a method with the PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 11 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 data readily accessible would be helpful in countries that do not collect data specific to food 
waste. At the time of the revision of the Food Recycling Law in 2007, the following items were 
revised in addition to the introduction of mandatory reporting of food waste generation: 
 Additional recycling method.  Additional treatment of food resources: heat recovery.  Setting targets of recycling rate for each industry and reference targets for each 
operators. 
 Handling a franchise chain as a single integrated operator.  Review of the certification system of business plans on recycling to facilitate efforts by 
food-related businesses. Box 1. One meal's worth of calories are lost between the supply and intake amounts in Japan The calories supply per capita initially shows an increasing trend from 2 530 kcal in 1970 to 2 670 kcal in 1996, and then 
a decline to 2 436 kcal in 2011 (Figure 2). On the other hand, calorie intake per capita has decreased steadily since 1970 and 
was 1 788 kcal in 2011. It is considered that the difference between the two figures provides a rough indication of inevitable 
residues during the processing stage of the food industry and leftover foods at the household level, etc., and equates to 
around 600 to 700 kcal, which is equivalent to one meal of a day. Figure 2. Trends in calorie supply and intake per capita in Japan 1. The intake and supply amounts are surveyed and calculated differently, and the difference is indicative only.

recycling. Although a reduction in generation of food waste has priority, other activities after 
generation are also important. Food materials should be recycled as feed and fertiliser where 
feasible, and only if recycling is difficult should heat recovery be carried out. In the case 
where recycling and heat recovery are both impossible, the amount of waste should be 
reduced by dewatering and drying. Such priority setting in Japan is in line with 
recommendations such as those embodied in the  " toolkit "  by the FAO (2013). In the practice of recycling, the amount, composition and potential demand of food waste 
should be clearly understood in order to select the appropriate method of recycling. Discharge 
of waste is properly separated from containers, packaging, tableware, and any other foreign 
matter, e.g. toothpick and food waste that are not suitable for recycling. The livestock feed use 
of waste is a means capable of recycling effectively calorie and ingredients, which contributes 
to the improvement of feed self-sufficiency. It is important to select it preferentially when 
performing recycling, while ensuring the safety of the feed. Fertiliser should be produced on 
the premise to ensure its utilisation, by taking into account the quality needs of farmers and 
the supply and demand situation of organic fertiliser in regional markets. The revision of the 
law in 2007 added ethanol and hydrocarbon products to be used as fuel and a reducing agent 
as recycling methods, in addition to feed, fertilisers, oils and fats, and methane. 
 The revision has also added heat recovery as a treatment of food resources. However, it 
is restricted to situations where recycling is difficult. There are two conditions where 
heat recovery should be chosen. 
 There is no manufacturing facility of specific feed and fertiliser in a range of 75 km, and 
the nature and type of food waste is extremely difficult to recycle. 
 Even if there is a manufacturing facility of specific feed and fertiliser within 75 km, it is 
possible to recover energy equally or more efficiently than that of methane. The certification system of the business plan on recycling has been reviewed to include 
additional requirements for certification where food-related operators are sure to accept 
specific products of agriculture, livestock and fisheries which have been produced with 
recycled feeds and fertilisers, to the amount stipulated by the ordinance of the Ministry. In 
short, there is a need to complete the recycling loop that circulates food resources among the 
three parties (Box 2). More than a decade has passed since the Food Recycling Law was enacted and the 
majority of food waste associated with business activities is now recycled in Japan. With 
regard to the quantitative analysis in the OECD study of food waste and loss reduction 
impacts on markets and trade, it should be noted that the materials that have been recycled as 
a by-product will be counted as waste, and only the amount of reduction will be dealt with in 
the study. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 13 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Box 2. Assessment of environmental impact of the food waste recycling in Japan The Food Recycling Law in Japan promotes the  " recycling loop "  that requires food industries to 
purchase farm products that are grown using food waste-derived compost/animal feed. One question is 
whether these recycling loops are environmentally and economically effective. Takata et al, (2012) applied the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) approach to 
evaluate global warming potential and running cost of five looped facilities for machine integrated compost, 
windrow compost, liquid feed, dry feed, and bio-gasification. The LCA results showed low total GHG 
(greenhouse gas) emissions of − 126 and − 49 kg-CO2/t-waste, respectively, for dry feed and bio-
gasification facilities, due to a high substitution effect. The LCC study showed a low running cost for 
composting facilities of – 15 648 and – 18 955 JPY/t-waste, respectively, due to high revenue from the food 
waste collection. It was found that mandatory reporting of food waste emitters to the government increased collection 
fees; however, the collection fee from animal feed facilities was relatively low because food waste was 
collected at a low price or nutritious food waste was purchased to produce quality feed. In the 
characterisation survey of various treatment methods, the composting facilities showed a relatively low 
environmental impact and a high economic efficiency. Animal feed facilities had a wide distribution of the total GHG emissions, depending on both the energy 
usage during the drying process and the substitution effect, which were related to the water content of the 
food waste and the number of recycled products. In comparison with incineration, the majority of the food 
recycling facilities showed low GHG emissions and economic effectiveness. The study also reported on the 
effects of recycling loops by comparing looped and non-looped animal feed facilities, and confirmed that the 
looped facilities were economically effective due to an increased amount of food waste collection. 1.2. 
Target for the control of food waste generation An issue after the revision of the legislation in 2007 is the effort of controlling the 
generation of food waste. In the summary of the review meeting held in December 2006, 
proposals were made as follows for the promotional measures to reduce food waste generation 
(Box 3). Box 3. Excerpt from the summary of the Food Recycling Law review in Japan Control of the generation of food waste is defined as the top priority. However, it is difficult to point out 
any clear results indicating the progress of generation control, and current efforts seem to be insufficient. 
One reason is that the promotion mechanism and the assessment of generation control do not reflect the 
characteristics of food-related businesses in order to effectively encourage their activities. Therefore, to further promote the control of waste generation within the current framework, the goal to 
achieve this generation control should be established separately from the target of recycling, based on the 
characteristics of the business category and industry. On the other hand, at the time the goals were set it was intended not to put excessive constraints on 
industrial activities so as to avoid the situation where the domestic food industry would unnecessarily seek 
overseas procurement of semi-finished or finished products. From this point of view, the basic unit of 
generation control should be established with reference to the progressive approaches by some operators 
and in order to provide goals for other individual food-related businesses. Characteristics of the industry and 
business category should be taken into account, for example, by strengthening the efforts of operators 
whose basic unit is less than the average. As noted, the revision of the Food Recycling Law requires periodical reporting of waste 
generation and recycling by each operator creating more than 100 tonnes of food waste. It is 
planned that the government establishes the target value for the control of food waste 
generation based on the data gained from the mandatory reporting. In this connection, the 
MAFF and MOE jointly created a working group to carry out a technical investigation. 
Targets for the control of food waste generation have been set (Table 1). They first covered 14 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 16 industry groups that dispose of edible parts of food due to over-production, over-storage 
and product returns; the target levels have been tentatively set for a two year period starting 
from April 2012. Since April 2014, these targets have been fully operational by widening the 
coverage to 26 industry groups. They apply the  " reference generation unit "  indicator as the 
target amount of food waste reduction. This indicator is the amount of food waste generated 
divided by the indicator that closely relates to the amount of food waste, such as sales, and 
production volumes and varies according to the type of business. í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¢í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ =

units with less control of waste generation so as to contribute to a control of waste generation 
throughout the entire industry, rather than to set up targets based on good track records of the 
more progressive companies with low reference generation units. Specifically, the target 
values were obtained by adding the standard deviation (set as 0.5 sigma) to a two-year 
average of the reference generation unit of each industry. As a result, about 70% of all PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 15 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 operators will have already achieved the desired reference generation unit. However, it is 
necessary for the operators below the target value to strive to maintain or reduce the reference 
generation unit. At present, it is desired that target setting will be accomplished with as many 
industries as possible with a view to promoting efforts throughout the food chain, and there is 
an emphasis on increasing this momentum by civil society. Before the full implementation from April 2014, target setting was reviewed in light of 
data from the latest mandatory reporting, for both of 16 industry groups with tentative targets 
and 21 groups without target setting. 15 groups among preceding 16 groups were considered 
for full implementation, but many operators have not achieved their tentative targets, and 
these tentative targets of 15 groups have been set as the targets for full implementation. The 
period of full implementation has been set as five years from April 2014, in view of targets 
for food recycling which are also set for five years. The sub-sections below are based on the report that the expert group submitted in January 
2012. This report describes how targets are established using the data from mandatory 
reporting and provides interesting observations on target setting and their prospects according 
to the stage of the food supply chain, such as food manufacturing and wholesale industries. (1) Base data and considerations on target setting Accurate data on the occurrence of food waste became available because of the 
mandatory reporting required for operators with food waste of more than 100 tonnes since the 
fiscal year 2008 after the revision of the Food Recycling Law. For this reason, the target value 
for the control of food waste generation was established based on the data from regular 
reports. The target value needs to be determined in each industry, using the particular 
indicator that closely relates to the amount of food waste such as sales and production 
volume. In order to identify the indicator, correlation analysis of the potential indicators and 
the amount of food waste was performed. For some industries, the correlation analysis was 
done in subdivided industry groups to set the target value, thus better reflecting their actual 
situations. It was decided that industries which lack necessary data to carry out the correlation 
analysis were to be exempted from the first exercise. According to the recommendations in 
the summary review of the Food Recycling Law in 2007, the exercise should not place 
excessive burdens on any industrial activity. For this reason, interviews with industry 
representatives and surveys via questionnaires, in addition to the mandatory reporting, were 
conducted in order to develop the target setting in light of the characteristics of the industry. 
Where there seemed to be an excessive burden placed on an industry, the target setting was 
foregone. (2) Considerations on target setting for food manufacturing industry The rate of recycling implemented by the food manufacturing industry as a whole reached 
95% in 2011, achieving the target value set for 2012. Recycling was the primary activity 
carried out, and the volume of waste disposal was relatively small. The food waste generated 
from food manufacturing industry occurs either as a result of transactions with food 
distribution industry or due naturally to the production of food. Of these, inedible parts of 
food such as bone and certain meat parts from livestock and marine products and pomace of 
fruit juice that inevitably occurs during food production is difficult to be re-used as food, and 
the control of its occurrence requires development of new technologies and new products, 
which is a difficult effort within a short period of time. For this reason, for those industries for 
which food waste is composed of inedible parts of food should not be subjected to target 
setting at this stage and to efforts to reduce food waste. 16 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 The parts of food which are edible but which are removed during the food manufacturing 
process, e.g. breadcrumbs and poultry livers, can be reused as food by the development of 
new products. However, it is time consuming and not easy to develop new products, and the 
balance between the part of food used for manufacturing and other edible parts from 
manufacturing does not necessarily meet demand. Thus the generation control of these parts is 
difficult in the short timeframe. The method of setting the target value for the reduction 
amount of food which is edible but inevitably removed during food manufacturing should be 
treated with caution so that it does not put excessive constraints on industrial activities. Since 
it is nevertheless desirable to control the occurrence of food waste which occurs during food 
manufacturing, it is necessary to first quantify amounts of edible and inedible parts in order to 
assess the possibility and methods to control these amounts. On the other hand, food waste that occurs as a result of transactions within the food 
distribution industry, e.g. overproduction, excessive stocks, returned goods, can be reused 
directly as food. Such food waste has scope for control through the review of business 
customs, the improvement of more accurate orders, and the use of food banks. The methods 
can be determined through discussion and various approaches are possible depending on the 
scheme. (3) Considerations on target setting for food distribution (wholesale and retail) industry The recycling rates implemented by food wholesaling and food retailing reached 57% and 
41%, respectively, in 2011; both are below the target level established for 2012. The absolute 
amount of food waste from food retailing is larger than that of food wholesaling (Figure 3). 
Food waste from the retailing industry derive mainly from excessive stocks, damaged goods, 
cooking wastes, and unsold goods which occur in the course of distribution, cooking and 
sales. It is important to control these amounts as they are mostly edible; this will also 
contribute to achieving the target recycling rate. A variety of control measures are possible; 
for example, greater accuracy when ordering amounts of food products, the use of food banks, 
consumer education. In addition, while food waste generated by returned goods and excess 
inventory occurs throughout the food chain, the distribution industry should take the lead in 
efforts to control such waste and spread the efforts to other participants in the food chain. When setting the target value, downstream industries such as retailing should go ahead of 
others. In this case, it is necessary to avoid easy solutions that are restrained to just returning 
the good to the upstream food manufacturing industry. The food waste generated from 
wholesale agriculture, livestock and fisheries and fresh fish retailers, excluding the meat 
wholesale industry, is characterised by a small amount of unsold or returned goods but a not 
so negligible amount of internal organs of fish, preparation residue of vegetables and rice 
bran, which is confronted with the same problem of food waste that inevitably occurs during 
food manufacturing. Thus, it is necessary in the future to consider the possibility and methods 
to control food waste by properly understanding the generation of food waste. (4) Considerations on target setting for catering industry The recycling rates implemented by the catering industry reached 23% in 2011, which is 
below the target level set for 2012, and it indicates a large amount of food waste disposal 
(Figure 3). Food waste from the catering industry is mainly composed of cooking waste and 
uneaten foods which occur in the course of cooking, eating, drinking and sales. It is important 
to control these amounts as they are mostly edible, and their recycling seems difficult to 
progress because of contamination with foreign ingredients, salts and oils. Thus reducing 
waste will be achieved by reducing the base amount. A variety of control measures are 
possible, for example supply better reflecting sales volume, optimisation of cooking volume, 
use of doggy bags for leftovers. Whatever the approach used, a basic understanding by 
consumers is a prerequisite. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 17 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 In the review of 2014, business categories within the catering industry are diverse but in 
order to reflect the manner of food waste generation well, target value setting has been done 
by dividing the restaurant to smaller subgroups. Targets of other categories in catering 
industry are in line with the current industry classification used in the mandatory reporting. (5) Industry groups for which target values cannot be established Following are the 14 industry groups, which will strive to control food waste generation 
and to promote recycling in the meantime by voluntary efforts, with a view to setting their 
target values in future. Their food waste is mostly inedible part that inevitably occurs during 
food production, but quantification of edible and inedible parts of the food is insufficient, and 
it will still be required to assess the possibility and methods to control these amounts. 
 Meat parts and frozen meat manufacturing industry  Seaweed processing industry  Manufacturing of salted goods and dried salted products  Frozen marine products manufacturing  Frozen aquatic food manufacturing industry  Cane sugar manufacturing  Miscellaneous grain-milling  Tea industry  Coffee manufacturing  Fruit wine manufacturing industry  Rice, barley and millet wholesaling  Vegetables and fruit wholesaling  Fresh seafood wholesaling  Fresh fish retail These industry groups manufacture or produce meat and fish products, grain-milling and 
wholesaling of vegetables, and fresh fish. These commodities and the stages of the food 
supply chains seem to correspond with the categories that show low figures in the food loss 
and waste estimates to be used in the scenario analysis using the Aglink-Cosimo model. For 
example, in the food loss and waste estimates, the processing and packaging, and distribution 
stages of cereals in Europe and North America shows low figures of 0.5%-10% and 2% 
respectively, and primary processing and storage stages of meat and seafood are lower than 
1%. These figures suggest it is more difficult to control food waste for these commodities and 
industries in particular. It has been assumed that considerable discussion and technical assessments for each 
industry groups were made by experts to establish the target value of waste reduction that can 
be accepted by industries, academics and the government. The current target values do not 
refer to the level of food waste that should be possible as the starting point. The concept is to 
evaluate the current level of food waste as fairly as possible, and to start with a target that is 
easy to tackle in view of the reality faced by industries. 18 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 (6) Recent situation about the control of food waste This sub-section summarises how the control of food wastes has been progressing. 
Currently, the data on the amount of food waste and the recycling rate are estimated using 
statistical surveys and mandatory reporting under the Food Recycling Law. Figure 3 shows 
the change in the amount of food waste generated by the food industry. There is a gap in the 
data series between 2007 and 2008, and we will focus on the data since 2008. The food 
industry has been regularly reducing food waste generation, especially in the food 
manufacturing industry which accounts for most of food waste generation. The amount of 
food waste declined from 20.9 Mt in 2010 to 19.96 Mt in 2011, which is about 4%, where the 
share of food manufacturing industry is 83%. The food manufacturing industry and catering 
(restaurants) show declines in the recent year, but the data on wholesalers do not change, and 
the retailers show an increase of 7%. Considerations on target setting summarised in the last section reflect the data in Figure 3. 
Food manufacturers, which show the largest amount of food waste generation and also most 
of its reduction, have already achieved high rates of recycling and low rates of waste disposal. 
Part of such efficiency may be due to the fact that most wastes from food manufacturers are 
categorised as inedible or edible part of food loss that inevitably occurs during food 
production, which are easier to control and less difficult to reduce the amount than other kinds 
of food loss and waste. Figure 3. Change in the amount of food waste generation in food industry in Japan The gap in the data series between 2007 and 2008 is due to the introduction of mandatory 
reporting for operators with more than 100 tonnes of food waste per year. In 2008, the 
amounts reported by operators with more than 100 tonnes of food waste totalled more than the 
amount calculated for 2008 based on the estimation methodology used up to 2007. There were 
several reasons for this. For example, up to 2007, statistics were collected from the samples 
hierarchically divided according to the number of employees without knowing the relative 10.8 4.3 0.7 2.3 3.4 11.3 4.9 0.7 2.6

manufacturing industry which involves relatively large waste generations, the data of the 
operators that generate a large amount of waste were not sufficiently obtained in the statistical 
survey before 2008. This provided a general lesson in conducting sample surveys, but since 
then, estimates are made only for operators with less than 100 tonnes of food waste, these are 
then combined with the results of periodic reporting introduced by revised Food Recycling 
Law, which improved the estimation methods and has produced figures closer to reality. (7) Statistics for consumers and catering industries In addition to policy measures and statistics for the food industry, MAFF (2013a) 
conducts statistical surveys on the food waste occurring in household consumption and 
catering (restaurants). This amount of waste represents discarded food, including outdated 
foodstuff and ready-to-eat food, edible portion removed by the decay during preparation and 
table leftovers. Since the scope food loss concerned in the household survey is intended to be 
the inner number of net food supply and demand of the Food Balance Sheet, the following 
components are not included. 
 The amount that has been directed to feed, etc.  Depletion during storage, transport, warehouse, and point-of-sale.  Inedible parts of food such as fish bones and vegetable waste. One question may be how the survey distinguishes the inedible parts from that which is 
discarded as food waste. The survey uses the discard rate prescribed by the Ministry of 
Education in the  " Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan. "  For example, if radish 
skins are peeled too thick and the amount exceeds the discard rate for radishes as set forth by 
the Standard Table, the difference will be counted as food waste and the amount 
corresponding to the discard rate will be considered as inedible. Figure 4 shows the amount of food usage and food waste per person per day. Fruits 
(8.9%), vegetables (8.7%), and seafood (6.0%) account for higher rates of waste than other 
commodity groups. The overall rate of food loss is 3.7% in 2009. A comparison with other 
industrialised regions for the food waste at the consumption stage (Table 2) shows the low 
rates that appear in the Japanese survey. Large differences in staple foods may relate not only 
to the data collection methodology, but also to the fact that food supply per person in Japan is 
one of the lowest among industrialized countries and eating portions are generally small, as 
observed by Stuart (2009). Childhood education on food consumption where leftover is 
considered wasteful (Mottainai) may partly explain these effects. Table 2. Regional food loss and waste estimated by FAO and the survey in Japan Commodity

The amount of food usage and food waste per person per day in Japan in 2009 Source: MAFF. This statistical survey also shows the rate of food waste classified by the structure of 
household members and the age of the dietary manager of the household. In terms of 
household member structure, two-person households (4.2%) and single-person households 
(4.8%) are beginning to show higher food waste than the households of three or more people 
(3.4%). The households with an elderly dietary manager show more food waste than those 
with a younger dietary manager, and the rate increases when the age classification goes from 
over 50 to over 60 years old. Changes in the aging Japanese society, such as the increase in 
single-person households, seem to impact the issue of food waste negatively. In this survey, the degree of food freshness has been cited the most frequently as the 
reason for direct disposal of food and foodstuff. Other reasons, such as the expiration of use 
by date and best before date, come after that concerning freshness. These survey results may 
be due to insufficient understanding of date labelling method, as we can see that the best 
before date is taken as a reason to discard foods as well as the use by date. Since the time 
series data on food waste by the survey shows no major change in the trend at the household 
level (Figure 5), it seems that existing policies are more effective in impacting the food 
industry. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 21 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Figure 5. The trend of amount of food usage and food waste per person per day in Japan Source: MAFF. 1.3. 
Reasons and countermeasures against food loss and waste In order to promote the control of the generation of food waste, it is necessary to propose 
feasible and effective measures by understanding the cause and occurrence of food waste. For 
example, whereas in the upstream side and food manufacturing industry foods have been 
discarded without being shipped as a result of excessive production to avoid shortage, the 
industries in direct contact with consumers, such as retailing, tend to focus on freshness of 
products, constant replenishment, and enhancing the store shelves in order to avoid a bad 
reputation due to shortages and service degradation. Such business behaviour on the 
presumption of consumer needs is considered to be a major factor of food loss and waste in 
the food industry. Japan's Organics Recycling Association reported in detail the causes of food loss and 
waste in 2011 as a result of interview surveys on the occurrence of food loss and waste. The 
report summarises the causes by types of food industry, such as manufacturing, wholesaling 
and retailing, and by types of foods such as ready-made, daily delivered goods, frozen, canned 
and retort food. It also analysed the causes of food waste associated to particular business 
customs and which are useful to refer to when examining individual measures against food 
loss and waste. Table 3 summarises different causes of food loss and waste among the food 
manufacturing, wholesale and retail industries. 1 167

counterparts is difficult for individual companies to resolve, and this should be tackled by the 
entire food chain. In this regard, the food industry in Japan has installed a  " working team to 
examine business customs to reduce food waste "  as a means for discussion among 
manufacturing, wholesale and retail industries. The government is supporting the secretariat 
to promote the initiative. The team of 18 people announced their interim report for the food 
waste reduction in March 2013. Their results of survey on returned goods and disposal of 
processed food revealed the followings. Causes of returned goods are soiled and damaged 
products, expiration of delivery or sales dates and replacements for new products, etc. 
 The rate of disposal without shipment is high in beverages and confectionery.  Causes of disposal without shipment are low prediction accuracy of shipment and 
expiration of delivery date, etc. 
 Expiratory date of delivery is often set as the one-third of the period set as best before 
date. The working team is expected to deal with a pilot project to review expiratory dates of 
delivery and extension and labelling method of best before date in particular. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 23 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 (2) Pilot project to review expiratory date of deliver One of the business customs between food manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers is 
called the  " one-third rule. "  According to this rule, retailers divide the period from the date of 
manufacture to the best before date into roughly three equal parts, and apply them as the 
period for the products to be delivered from manufacturers or wholesalers and as the period 
for the products to be sold to consumers. For example in Figure 6, for a product with a best 
before date of six months, retailers will reject or return the products which have passed two 
months since the date of manufacture to their manufacturers or wholesalers. For the products 
which have passed four months since the date of manufacture and with less than one-third of 
their best before dates remaining, retailers will remove them from the shop front, discard them 
or sell them at a discounted price. With the one-third rule retailers can secure more than one-third of the best before dates 
for any goods to be sold at the store. This business custom in Japan applies stricter standards 
of freshness compared with other countries. For example, the deadline for product delivery in 
the United States is set as half of the best before dates, and in the case of European countries 
it is two-thirds of the best before dates. Naturally, this business custom will be a cause of food 
waste with returned or rejected products. A cooperation council consisting of 43 companies of food manufacturing, wholesaling 
and retailers estimated the amount of returned processed foods from wholesalers to food 
manufacturers to be JPY 113.9 billion a year based on the value of manufacturer shipment in 
the fiscal year 2010. The expiration of delivery date accounts for more than one-third of the 
reasons for returned goods. The removal of products from the shelf due to the launch of new 
products also accounts for more than one-third of reasons for returned goods. On the other 
hand, returned products from retailers to wholesalers amount to JPY 41.7 billion, for reasons 
such as the expiration of sell-by date prescribed by the one-third rule. Another study by the 
working team to examine business customs to reduce food waste with 16 companies 
participating, 74% of the products returned to the manufacturer are discarded, and the amount 
of resale through other channels such as discount stores was a mere 16%. The causes for returned good and unshipped disposal are complex as they include 
damage, spoilage, product replacement and inaccuracy of prediction for delivery amount, but 
one important cause is considered to be the delivery deadline established through negotiations 
between companies and set as the custom. A pilot project has been implemented in 
cooperation with industry associations to relieve the delivery deadline, beginning from the 
items which may be easier to obtain the consensus among participants. In cooperation with 
the MAFF and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, participants from food and 
beverage manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers will extend the delivery deadline to 
retailers from one-third period to the half of the best before dates. The project will then 
examine how this affects the goods at the retail level, product inventory of delivery 
expiration, returned and discarded goods at dedicated logistic centres, simulation of unshipped 
discards at manufacturers, and undertake surveys on consumer purchasing intentions. The 
pilot project began in August 2013 and published the final results in March 2014, which 
includes the estimated potential to reduce waste from drink and confectionary with more than 
180 days of best before dates by 40 000 tonnes per year. 24 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Figure 6. Conceptual chart of one-third rule in Japan Source: Distribution Economics Institute of Japan (DEIJ). (3) Review of extension and labelling method of best before date In recent years, technology developments have been made to maintain the quality of the 
product longer through improvements in productivity and sanitation during the food 
manufacturing process and the development of packaging materials to allow for longer shelf 
life. However, it is believed that revising the expiration date was not necessarily performed 
alongside such technological development, and existing expiratory dates may not reflect the 
current situation correctly. For this reason, the food manufacturing industry is verifying best 
before dates of existing products based on scientific knowledge from the viewpoint of food 
waste reduction. It will include the review of guidelines, manuals and safety indicators by 
industry groups on setting the best before dates. Based on the results obtained, the industry is 
supposed to address the extension of best before dates, while gaining the understanding by 
consumers. As for the review of labelling methods, the items with a long shelf-life have a lower speed 
of quality degradation and it is less meaningful to manage them by date rather than month at 
the consumption stage; the delivery of these by date order at the distribution stage may lead to 
the occurrence of food waste. Since items of more than three months of shelf-life are already 
allowed to display the best before date with month and year only, companies are expected to 
devise existing labelling methods for the items with long shelf-life, including the change to 
month/year labelling, to be understood by consumers without difficulty. For example, the cooperative organisation of small and medium-sized supermarkets 
called CGC Japan has been asking industry groups and manufacturers to review and extend 
the shelf-life, but it is very time consuming and burdensome to realise in practice. Thus CGC 
Japan has started to review the expiration dates of its own private-brand products, and they 
assumed that the shelf-life of canned products can be as long as ten years without problem, PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 25 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 whereas it is usually set as three years after manufacture. In cooperation with a leading food 
manufacturer, some of their private-brand products such as boiled mackerel were proved to 
have no problem by sensory tests, and their expiration dates have been extended from three to 
four years. The extension of best before date from two to three years was done for bottled 
water, and the extension from one and half year to two years for packed rice cakes. These 
reviews were thought to be urgent especially after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, 
as water, canned products and rice cakes are identified to make it more possible to spend the 
interim refuge. They are focused on the extension of best before dates of product that can be 
used as stored meal in order to increase the domestic stockpile against disasters. CGC Japan 
also argues that the extension of the best before dates based on scientific evidence is directly 
linked to the cost reduction of food manufacturers. In another example in 2014, the best 
before dates of instant noodles in cups and sachets have been extended according to the 
guideline set by an industry organization for instant foods. Unshipped disposal that occurs even after these reviews of business customs should be 
addressed by the food bank or the society-wide efforts to reduce food waste. In Japan, active 
recycling activities are targeting food wastes that are still generated despite these initiatives to 
reduce them. 1.4. 
Future prospects In October 2014, in response to the discussions between experts in the Joint Committee, 
MAFF and MOE produced the future orientation of the food recycling system. In view of the 
review and inspection of the implementation of the Food Recycling Law every five years, 
they have been continuing the debate since then. In addition to voluntary efforts such as the 
extension of best before dates by food industries and the full-scale implementation of target 
setting on the control of food waste generation described above, strengthening cooperation 
amongst local governments, food industries and recycling businesses has also been explored 
as a future focus. On the other hand, the measures in Japan summarised in this paper seem effective but 
concerned only generation control and the recycling of food waste in the food industry. It 
does not cover food loss occurring at the farm level. It is noted that the amount of food waste 
at the consumer stage has not shown any change in recent years. The government has started 
to reinforce the campaign targeting consumers in 2013 to reduce food waste, called  " NO-
FOODLOSS PROJECT " , and statistical surveys on food waste occurring at the household 
consumption and catering (restaurants) levels will be implemented for the first time since 
2009. Looking over the entire food chain, the future challenges against food loss and waste at 
consumer stage of food chain are clearly evident. 26 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 2. Preventing food waste in the United Kingdom: 
A UK case study 2.1. 
Policy context In 2000, households, commerce and industry in England and Wales generated 106 Mt of 
waste a year, 83% of which went to landfill; the average municipal composting and recycling 
rate was just 9%. That year, the Governments of England and Wales published Waste Strategy 
2000 for England and Wales, calling for a tripling of municipal composting and recycling 
rates, and an 85% reduction in the amount of commercial and industrial waste sent to landfill, 
both by 2015. At the time, household waste was growing at 3% a year. As a result, the United 
Kingdom has adopted a range of approaches to tackle food waste and between 2007 and 2012 
household food waste decreased by 15% which equates to an estimated 1.3 Mt reduction in 
food waste over a five year period. New data on historical changes and a scenario analysis of 
what may be achievable in the future suggests that between 2015 and 2025 around 20 Mt of 
food waste could be prevented in the United Kingdom (WRAP, 2014d). While there is an economic, social and environmental rationale to tackle food waste, there 
are barriers that have prevented businesses and households taking action to tackle this, such as 
lack of awareness and information, and lack of fora for businesses to safely share best 
practice. For this reason there has been a requirement for government intervention, which has 
primarily been delivered through WRAP (The Waste and Resources Action Programme 1 ). 
Although good progress has been made in the United Kingdom, approximately 15 Mt of food 
and drink are still wasted each year, a loss to the economy and a cost to the environment. 
Around half of this is from households (7 Mt), of which 60% is avoidable (i.e. could have 
been consumed, rather than being inedible such as bones, tea bags, etc.). UK householders 
spend GBP 12.5 billion every year on food that could have been eaten but ends up being 
thrown away. Food and packaging waste also costs business money. Food waste and 
packaging waste in the UK food supply chain is estimated at GBP 6.9 billion a year (WRAP, 
2013a), which is equivalent to more than 10% of GVA (which was GBP 52 billion for 2012). 
There are wider environmental implications when food is wasted, such as around 20 Mt of 
CO 2 e a year and many billions of tonnes of water, the majority of which is associated with the 
production, transport and packaging of food rather than its disposal. Accordingly, food waste 
was one of the priority waste streams under the Waste Prevention Programme for England 
(Defra, 2011a; updated in Defra, 2013a). Tackling food waste provides economic benefits for both business and households. 
Households can save the money previously spent on wasted food or use it to purchase other 
goods. For businesses reducing waste helps to support a sustainable, competitive sector, 
where improved profitability can come from reducing costs associated with waste. There will always be some unavoidable food waste, such as meat bones or peelings, and 
this waste should be directed into the appropriate treatment, such as anaerobic digestion (AD) 1 
http://www.wrap.org.uk/. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 27 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 or composting. Waste treated by AD can produce biomethane, a renewable energy source, 
which in turn can be used to generate electricity, heat, be injected directly into the gas grid or 
used as a transport fuel. Growth in this part of the Waste Management sector is being stimulated in the United 
Kingdom by the Government's Anaerobic Digestion Strategy and Action Plan (Defra, 2011b). 
There has been significant growth in the AD sector over the last two years, with the number 
of plants rising from 54 when the AD Strategy was published to 115 currently. Much of this 
growth has been in plants treating food waste. There continues to be good progress in 
implementing the AD Action Plan (Defra, 2013b). 2.2. 
Definition of food waste The most commonly adopted specific definition of food 2 waste is that of the FAO (FAO, 
2011), which distinguishes between food losses, which occur as the result of 'unintentional' 
events and food waste, which occurs more through conscious action or 'negligence'. This 
definition only applies to the edible portions of food. There is currently much discussion 
about how best to define food waste, for example the EC-funded FUSIONS project has an 
objective to review available evidence and propose a standard approach on system boundaries 
and the definition of food waste 3 (and see Östergren et al. (2014) and a recent UK House of 
Lords Inquiry into food waste received evidence from a wide variety of sources on this topic 
(UK House of Lords European Union Committee (2014). The World Resources Institute 
(WRI), in collaboration with UNEP, FAO, WRAP and FUSIONS, will be designing a global 
standard for measuring food waste (the  " Food Loss and Waste Protocol " ), which will also aim 
to define the possible components of food loss and waste 4 . In order to facilitate its work on food waste prevention and management WRAP has 
proposed a simple definition of food waste 5 , which is: Food waste is any food that had the potential to be eaten, together with any 
unavoidable waste, which is lost from the human food supply chain, at any point along 
that chain. This definition covers: 
 Only food produced for human consumption;  All food and drink types, all disposal routes, and all sectors of the supply chain; and  Both avoidable (edible) and unavoidable (inedible) food waste. This definition does not include: 
 Food/food surplus used as animal feed because this is not viewed as 'leaving the human food 
supply chain', and therefore is not considered to be waste, but rather prevents material from 
becoming waste. 2. 
In this paper,  " food waste "  is used as shorthand for  " food and drink waste. "  3. 
See http://eu-fusions.org/news/making-progress-towards-defining-food-waste. 4. 
http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-food-loss-and-waste-measurement-protocol. 5. 
The European Commission has proposed a definition of food waste, consistent with both the WRAP and 
FUSIONS definitions, see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/DOC/?uri=CELEX:52014PC0397&from=EN. 28 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Understanding all fractions of food waste is important when considering both prevention 
and optimal treatment of waste. The classification of avoidable (edible) vs. unavoidable 
(inedible) may vary with culture, and steps can be taken to influence both avoidable and 
unavoidable waste, through changes in the types of food bought (for example households 
purchasing more prepared foods, better trimmed fresh produce, chicken breasts vs whole 
chickens – ensuring that greater benefit is gained from the unavoidable fractions in the supply 
chain [soups, stocks, etc.). Unavoidable waste is however much more likely to be affected (and increase) as a result 
of an increasing population (the UK population is forecast to grow by 6 million by 2025, a 
10% increase (UK ONS, 2014). There is broad agreement that the following are the most important factors to quantify, in 
terms of the amounts arising and their fate, from which clear comparisons can be made 
between the factors on which those interrogating the data wish to focus, and to have strategies 
in place to minimise the economic and environmental impact of: 
 Total food waste (food made to be consumed by humans but which ends up not being so).  Both avoidable and unavoidable fractions (the classification of which may vary).  Food and related materials (including by-products) used as animal feed.  Other by-products arising from the food supply chain. A focus on practical and robust approaches to quantify the above is as, if not more 
important than gaining agreement on the definition of food waste. 2.3. 
Food waste arising in the United Kingdom Three major WRAP studies carried out in 2013 estimated annual food waste arising 
within households, hospitality and food service, food manufacture, retail and wholesale 
sectors at around 12 Mt (WRAP 2013a, 2013b, 2013c), 75% of which could have been 
avoided. This had a value of over GBP 19 billion a year, and was associated with at least 20 
Mt of greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 equivalents). Around 90% (by weight) of the avoidable 
food waste arises in households and food manufacture, although waste arising in one part of 
the supply chain is certainly influenced by other parts of the chain. The focus of work has been on households, hospitality and food service, food 
manufacture, retail and wholesale sectors. It has also been estimated that 3.0 Mt of food waste 
arises from other sectors (WRAP, 2014a). This includes estimates for other food thrown away 
by consumers out of home (e.g. from home-made lunches at work, as litter, in litter bins) and 
the pre-factory gate stages of the food supply chain. Existing estimates of agricultural food 
wastage are indicative, and based on a synthesis of evidence available at that time 
(Environment Agency, 2004), and may include food losses as a result of weather, for 
example. Food waste and losses arising in agriculture has not been an area of focus for 
WRAP. However, going forward, it will be looking at ways to improve resource efficiency 
and deliver financial savings throughout the whole supply chain, which would include 
understanding more about food waste on farm. The breakdown of this 15 Mt of food waste is illustrated in Figure 7 and Annex 2.A. In 
comparison around 43 Mt of food are purchased in the United Kingdom (Defra 2013c; 
WRAP, 2013d) (the majority for in home use), meaning that the amount of food wasted 
throughout the supply chain is equivalent to around a third of that purchased. In addition to 
food waste there are also 2.2 Mt of food or food by-products from food manufacturing used as 
animal feed, and another 2 Mt of animal by-products sent to rendering plants. Annexes 2.B 
and 2C illustrate the 'food loop' in the United Kingdom, and the initiatives directed at PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 29 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 reducing food waste around the loop. This updated, detailed evidence base will allow 
Governments, WRAP and its partners to make strategic decisions regarding the prevention, 
collection and treatment of food waste. It will enable the approaches and materials aimed at 
delivering this to be refreshed and targeted, bringing benefits to individuals, communities, 
businesses and the United Kingdom as a whole. Figure 7. Amount of food waste arising in the United Kingdom, by sector Total equals 15 Mt 7 Mt 3.9 Mt 0.4 Mt 0.9 Mt 3 Mt Household

Other Source: WRAP. (1) Household food waste (see WRAP 2013b for more detail) The 7.0 Mt of food and drink waste thrown away from households in 2012 is enough to 
fill Wembley Stadium in the United Kingdom nine times over, and represents 19%, by 
weight, of food and drink brought into the home. Of this total: 
 4.2 Mt (or 60% of the total) is avoidable, worth GBP 12.5 billion. This avoidable waste 
is food and drink that would have been edible at some point prior to being thrown away, 
for example slices of bread, apples, yoghurts, etc. This is equivalent to the average 
household throwing away six meals per week, and is equivalent to 12% of the weight of 
edible food and drink brought into the home. 
 1.2 Mt (17% of the total) was considered 'possibly avoidable'. This includes bread crusts 
and potato peelings that some people eat but others do not. 
 1.6 Mt (23% of the total) was unavoidable waste. Five types of waste made up 60% of 
this (tea waste, banana skins, poultry bones, onion skins and orange peel). Two-thirds (4.7 Mt) of household food and drink waste was collected by local authorities. 
Of this, most was collected in kerbside 'residual' or general waste, although more than half a 
Mt (around 11% of that collected) was in targeted collections of food waste, meaning it could 
be treated to generate energy and useful digestate or compost. Around a fifth was disposed of 
via the sewer (1.6 Mt; the kitchen sink and other drains), with drinks and dairy products 
making up more than half of this. The remainder was either composted at home (0.51 Mt) or 
fed to animals (0.28 Mt). 30 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 For the average household, the price of the avoidable food and drink waste was around 
GBP 470 per year, and therefore, avoidable food and drink waste accounted for approximately 
14% of the shopping budget. The higher the number of people in a household, the greater the amount of food waste 
generated, although the increase was not proportional, i.e. an average four-person household 
wastes less than four times the average single-occupancy household. One-person households 
threw away, on average, over 40% more avoidable food and drink waste than the overall 
amount per person in the United Kingdom, worth GBP 290 a year compared to the UK 
average of GBP 200 per person. By weight (Figure 8), the largest contributions to avoidable food waste were from: 
 Fresh vegetables and salads (19%; 810,000 tonnes).  Drink (17%; 710,000 tonnes).  Bakery (11%; 450,000 tonnes).  Home-made and pre-prepared meals (10%; 440,000 tonnes).  Dairy and eggs (10%; 420,000 tonnes). By cost, the largest food groups wasted were: 
 Meat and fish (17%; GBP 2.1 billion).  Home-made and pre-prepared meals (17%; GBP 2.1 billion).  Fresh vegetables and salad (14%; GBP 1.7 billion).  Drink (10%; GBP 1.3 billion).  Fresh fruit (7%; GBP 900 million).

and more than 13 billion  " 5 a day "  portions of fruit and vegetables were thrown away in 
2012, 6 enough to provide more than 7 million people with their  " 5 a day "  for a year. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with avoidable food and drink waste from UK 
homes accounted for approximately 17 Mt of CO 2 equivalent (including contributions from 
growing, manufacturing, packaging, transporting and disposing of the waste).. The carbon 
saving of preventing all avoidable food waste in 2012 is equivalent to taking one in four cars 
off UK roads. Land is required to produce food and drink that is subsequently thrown away by UK 
households. For the first time, an estimate has been made of these land requirements: 19 000 
square kilometres or an area about 91% the size of Wales. Just under half of avoidable food and drink waste (worth GBP 5.6 billion) was classified 
as  " not used in time: "  thrown away because it had either gone off or passed the date on the 
packaging (Figure 9). This included large amounts of bread, milk and fresh potatoes. A 
further 31% (worth GBP 4.1 billion) was classified as  " cooked, prepared or served too much: "  
this included food and drink that had been left over after preparation or serving, such as 
carbonated soft drinks, home-made and pre-prepared meals, and cooked potatoes. 
Approximately 80% of food and drink is wasted because it either wasn't used in time, or too 
much was cooked, prepared or served, so addressing these issues will deliver the greatest 
benefits. The remaining reasons are linked to personal preferences including health reasons and not 
liking certain foods (GBP 1.9 billion), and accidents, including  " food dropped on the floor "  
and  " failure of a freezer "  (GBP 560 million). A new report (WRAP, 2014e) further explores 
the relationship between the level of avoidable food and drink waste from households, factors 
including socio-demographics, and behaviours relating to food, such as healthy eating and 
time available for food-related activities. The reasons for disposal vary considerably by food group. For the following categories, 
most was wasted because it was not used in time: fresh vegetables and salads, bakery, dairy 
and eggs, and fruit. For example, avoidable fresh vegetable and salad wasted because it was 
not used in time cost GBP 1.1 billion, approximately two-thirds of the total cost of fresh 
vegetables and salads thrown away. In contrast, drinks and meal waste had high levels of 
waste from leftovers: too much was prepared, cooked or served. 6. 
As per the accepted definition of what contributes to  " 5 a day, "  fresh fruit and vegetables are 
included (except for potatoes) alongside processed fruit, vegetables fruit juices and smoothies. 32 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Figure 9.

underestimate, due to the use of individual foods in meal preparation (e.g. fresh vegetables thrown away 
as part of a lasagne will be counted as meal waste rather than vegetable waste). PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 33 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Table 4. Food waste by type and per cent of that bought in the United Kingdom Food

and drinks for immediate consumption outside of the home. There are nine major HaFS 
subsectors as defined by Horizons 8 : staff catering, healthcare, education, services, restaurants, 
QSRs, pubs, hotels and leisure. The cost of food being wasted in the UK from the UK HaFS sector is estimated at 
GBP 2.5 billion per year in 2011, rising to GBP 3.0 billion per year by 2016. 920,000 tonnes 
of food is wasted at outlets each year, 75% of which is avoidable and could have been eaten. 
Preventing avoidable food waste has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
2.7 Mt (CO 2 equivalent). Overall 17.8% of total food purchased by the HaFS industry by 
weight is wasted, of which 13.2% is avoidable and the remaining 4.6% is unavoidable. The 
amount of food that is wasted is influenced by a number of factors, such as: the amount of on-
site food preparation, over-production of meals, menu choice and the extent to which 
consumers leave food uneaten. Table 5 highlights the scope of savings associated with food waste, ranked in descending 
order of tonnes arising, with the restaurant, pub and education the top three subsectors. The 
total costs associated with all food being wasted are greatest within restaurant, pub and hotel 
subsectors. Overall, the weight of food waste across the HaFS sector is equivalent to 1.3 billion 
meals, or throwing away one in every six of the 8 billion meals served each year. This takes 
account of differences in the average weight of a typical meal served across the nine different 
UK HaFS subsectors. In restaurants, pubs, services and leisure the proportion of food waste is 
over 20% of the weight of food purchased, equivalent to around one in five meals being 
wasted. Lower wastage rates are associated with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) and staff 
catering, where lighter meals are served and/or where snacks and 'grab and go' 9 catering is 
more prevalent 8. 
Horizons FS Limited, a supplier of market data and analysis for the UK HaFS sector 9. 
Note: a 'grab and go' provision could have resulted in less of the food waste being captured by 
the waste reviews conducted as part of this research as food waste may be disposed of away from 
the main catering outlet. 34 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Differences in levels of waste also relate to the use of ready-to-serve meals and pre-
prepared ingredients, in which case more of the waste is generated further up the supply chain 
(an estimated 130 000 tonnes of food is wasted from the preparation of ready to serve food 
items and meals at HaFS manufacturing sites. Ready-to-serve includes sandwiches, soups, 
sauces and pre-prepared meals). For instance, the supply chain waste associated with QSR is 
estimated to be equivalent to approximately a third of food waste discarded at QSR outlets. Table 5. The quantity and cost of food being wasted by the UK HaFS by subsector Subsector Number of

conducted between 2009 and 2012, and the average composition of food waste is summarised 
for HaFS as a whole in Figure 10. Key findings on the composition of food being wasted include: 
 
40% of all food waste is associated with 'carbohydrate foods', including the following 
avoidable categories: 
 potato and potato products (21%); 
 bread and bakery (12%); and 
 pasta/rice (7%).  
The higher value food types account for a lower proportion of avoidable food waste, 
for example: 
 fruit and vegetable food waste (15%); and 
 meat/fish (6%).  
The quarter of all food waste that is unavoidable mainly consists of fruit and vegetable 
peelings. Carbohydrates are a high priority across all subsectors, with wasted potatoes and potato 
products a significant component of food being wasted. Action to reduce these food types 
being wasted could have a significant impact in reducing the total amount of food being 
wasted. Higher value food types are also wasted across the HaFS (Table 6).

Average composition of food being wasted in the UK HaFS sector Source: WRAP (adapted from WRAP, 2013b). WRAP also carried out research to understand the point at which food is being wasted 
from spoilage, food preparation and from customer plates in different types of commercial 
kitchens, and identify the actions that would most significantly reduce food being wasted. 
This research shows that, on average: 
 
21% of food waste arises from spoilage; 
 
45% of food waste arises from food preparation; and 
 
34% of food waste is generated from customer plates. Table 7 shows where food waste arises in different kitchen types. The ratios of food waste 
arising are consistent across three of the commercial kitchen types, namely, contract catering, 
casual and fine dining. In the basic dining category, however, food waste from customer 
plates (46%) is higher than waste from preparation (32%); this may be due to a number of 
reasons including less food preparation on site. 36 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Table 6. Summary of priority food types to target in waste prevention in the United Kingdom Subsector Carbohydrates

(agriculture/fishing and households were excluded from this supply chain research). Waste 
disposed to sewer is also excluded (though WRAP has published estimates from signatories to 
its Courtauld Commitment; WRAP 2011a). All food and drink waste arising in manufacturing 
is attributed to the grocery retail market 10 . In total, some 10.7 Mt of food, drink and packaging is managed through the routes shown 
in Figure 11. Not all of this material is legally classed as waste and not all is lost to human 
consumption (though the majority is). Some material is legally classified as by-product and 10. 
Industrial classifications based on the dominant business activity at a site do not differentiate 
between grocery retail and foodservice markets. Similarly, waste audit data and Courtauld 
Commitment returns do not split out waste arising at a manufacturing site with respect to these 
different markets. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 37 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 may then be treated as a waste, in line with waste regulations. It has not proved possible to 
fully quantify all these flows in this Figure 11. Grocery waste and non-waste material flows in the United Kingdom Source: WRAP. The principal material output is waste (Column 1, waste food and packaging, Figure 11), 
as legally defined, and the work undertaken provides estimates, for 2011, of total waste from 
the grocery retail grocery sector disaggregated into food, packaging and mixed waste streams. 
These data are further disaggregated into, for example, the management routes for this waste. 
All the food and drink within this material is lost to human consumption. WRAP estimates that there are 6.5 Mt of grocery waste. 11 This total comprises 1.6 Mt 
from grocery retail and wholesale and 4.9 Mt from manufacturing. Grocery retailers and manufacturers segregate some food for waste and other management 
but there is also a significant quantity (0.8 Mt) of mixed waste that has not been segregated 11. 
Excludes all material that is disposed to sewer. Courtauld signatories reported some 0.2 Mt of 
waste was disposed to sewer in 2010.This suggests there are significant additional quantities of 
waste disposed this way and not included in the above total. Waste, food and 
packaging Surplus food 
redistributed Food to animal 
feed By-products 38 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 and comprises both food and packaging (there is also 0.5 Mt of 'Other' waste that is neither 
food/drink nor packaging). Total food waste from the grocery sector, therefore, includes food waste that is segregated 
and an estimate of food that is part of mixed waste (that is, not segregated). Total food waste 
in 2011 is 4.3 Mt. This includes 3.8 Mt of segregated food waste and 0.5 Mt of food included 
in the mixed, non-segregated waste stream (of which 0.4 Mt is from grocery retail and 0.1 Mt 
from manufacturing). Food waste in manufacturing amounts to 3.9 Mt and in grocery retail (and wholesale) 
0.4 Mt. Surplus food and drink that is redistributed (Column 2, surplus food redistributed, 
Figure 11) amounts to some 5 800 tonnes which goes to charities such as FareShare who use 
the surplus food to feed people. In addition, a minimum of 11 000 tonnes of food and drink is 
sold to organisations like 'The Company Shop' who buy food for sale onto secondary 
markets. 12 Both these routes for managing food are termed 'redistribution' because the food is 
still being consumed by humans, albeit probably involving an economic loss. Food used as an ingredient in animal feed (Column 3, food to animal feed in Figure 11) is 
more difficult to estimate. Some food material can also fall into Column 4, by-products, 
Figure 11 because they are legally defined as by-products (for example, spent grain from 
distilleries). It has been estimated that around 450 000 tonnes of food is used as an ingredient 
in animal feed and that further quantities of mostly unavoidable material like peelings and 
skins are also sent for animal feed together with material legally classed as animal by-
products. Wholly within Column 4, of Figure 11, are by-products from manufacturing operations 
and animal by-products and co-products that arise from slaughtering cows, pigs, sheep, 
chickens and fish. A total of 2.2 Mt of food is used as an ingredient in animal feed. About 
1.7 Mt is by-product and the remainder is food (Column 3 -food to animal feed, Figure 11). 
In addition, the carcase and other material from slaughtered animals are regarded as animal 
by-products (and co-products) under European legislation and primarily sent for rendering 
which in turn produces pet food and a range of non-food products. There are about 2.0 Mt of 
such material in the United Kingdom. 13 WRAP estimates that food and packaging waste is valued at GBP 6.9 billion. This 
includes the costs of producing food and packaging, disposal costs and lost profit. For food 
waste specifically the value is GBP 3.7 billion for manufacture and GBP 0.5 billion for retail. This money is being wasted and value is being lost to the economy. The total represents 
around 7% of consumer expenditure on food and drink and 8.6% of the sectors GVA. These 
percentages are likely to be a higher proportion than many grocery retailer and manufacturer 
profit margins (in comparison with sales). Whilst waste cannot be reduced to zero, there are 12. 
In this context the term refers largely to wholesalers and street markets. 13. 
FABRA estimate that 2.25 Mt of animal by-products are handled by the United Kingdom 
rendering industry. This includes material including fallen stock out of scope in this work. 
Animal by-products and co-products sent for rendering are classed as waste, but wastes sent to 
rendering are currently excluded from Waste controls under the revised Animal by Products 
Regulations. Readers should refer to the waste regulations and to guidance from the regulators, 
e.g. in England and Wales, the Environment Agency provides sector guidance.

_8d1271.pdf PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 39 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 significant opportunities to reduce it and achieve the associated economic benefits of doing 
so. Across WRAP's work, the GHG impact of agriculture, manufacturing, grocery retail and 
distribution is allocated to the food which is purchased by households. This means that no 
impacts are allocated to the creation of waste produced at each of these stages. For 
consistency, it is therefore appropriate only to attribute disposal emissions to the food waste 
when considering the footprint of supply chain food waste. Waste emissions from 
manufacture to grocery retail are estimated at 250 000 tonnes CO 2 e. However, there is also an opportunity cost associated with the wasted food. The 
opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone. Depending on whether the food 
was suitable for animal feed or human consumption, the opportunity cost is between 1 and 
13 Mt CO 2 e respectively. At present it is not possible to break down food waste arising in manufacturing and retail 
by food type, although WRAP has produced detailed 'resource maps' for key food categories, 
such as fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and fish, which document waste and economic losses 
through the supply chain (WRAP, 2011b). 2.4. 
Interventions and impact The primary mechanisms in the UK for facilitating the reduction in food waste are the 
Courtauld Commitment (CC) 14 and Hospitality and Food Service Agreement (HaFSA) 15 , both 
voluntary agreements managed by WRAP, and funded by Westminster, Scottish, Welsh and 
Northern Ireland governments, and the consumer facing Love Food Hate Waste (LFHW) 
campaign. 16 (1) Household food waste Over the last six years WRAP has built up a comprehensive evidence base which has 
raised awareness, developed a strong case for change and given focus to the areas where 
consumers need the most help, where business and local authorities can benefit, and where the 
biggest impacts can be made. Influencing decisions around food product design, production processes, purchase and use 
is challenging. WRAP has worked with a wide range of partners to develop a credible, 
integrated and consistent approach, increasingly supporting people and organisations to 
develop their own action plans. WRAP provides a suite of tools and guidelines making it 
easier for those consumers who want to change to buy the right amounts of food and make the 
most of what they buy. WRAP launched LFHW in 2007 to help deliver practical ways to reduce food waste, and 
expanded an agreement with the food industry (the CC) to help consumers make more of the 
food and drink they buy, and throw less away. Since that work in 2007, tackling food and drink waste has received much attention in the 
UK and indeed around the world: Governments, international agencies, businesses, local 
authorities, community groups and many others have worked with consumers to change the 
way we buy and use food. Major retailers, food brands and other manufacturers have helped 
through innovations in products, packaging and labelling. 14.

http://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/ 40 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 WRAP recently announced that there was 1.3 Mt less household food waste in 2012 
compared to 2007, a 15% reduction, despite an increase of 4% in the number of households in 
the UK (WRAP, 2013b). Almost all, 85% (1.1 Mt; or enough to completely fill Wembley 
Stadium) of this reduction was in food that could have been eaten (avoidable). Avoidable 
household food waste reduced by 21%, which would have cost GBP 3.3 billion to purchase. 
This means on average every household in the United Kingdom not having to spend GBP 130 
a year on food bought but thrown away, helping to mitigate the impact of rising food prices. 
In addition this will have prevented 4.4 Mt of carbon dioxide emissions a year, and saved a 
billion tonnes of water. External factors have also influenced levels of household food waste 
in this period, with an economic downturn and rising food prices. Untangling the 
contributions of such factors is an ongoing focus of further research. The contributions to the large reduction in avoidable food and drink waste were primarily 
concentrated in five categories, each with reductions of more than 100 000 tonnes: home-
made and pre-prepared meals, bakery, drink, fresh fruit and dairy and eggs. A range of 
behaviours (buying appropriate amounts, storing food under the optimal conditions, portion 
control, using the freezer more effectively etc.) and technical innovations (range of pack sizes 
available, improved storage and freezing guidance, clearer date labelling, increased shelf-life, 
packaging innovations etc.) will have contributed to these reductions, supported by LFHW 
and its partners through a wide range of national and local initiatives. Now in its third phase, the CC, with more than 50 of the largest food retailers, brands and 
manufacturers as signatories, has a target to further reduce household food and drink waste by 
another 5% by 2015. (2) Manufacturing and retail supply chain food waste The second phase of the CC introduced a target to reduce food and packaging waste in the 
supply chain by 5% (2012 vs 2009). WRAP has developed the W.A.S.T.E. process (Waste definition, Analyse and identify 
root causes, Solution generation, Trial, evaluate and measure and Execute sustainable change 
and reduce waste) to help businesses identify waste and reduce it within their operations and 
across supply chains. The W.A.S.T.E. process is based on a problem-solving discipline rooted 
in continuous improvement and LEAN manufacturing strategies and builds on established 
techniques. Resources are also available to assist during the various stages of the W.A.S.T.E. 
process. Good Practice Guidance for reducing waste has been produced, underpinned by 
WRAP's activity and research through waste prevention reviews undertaken at 26 UK sites in 
the food and drink manufacturing sector. In addition, waste prevention case studies highlight 
WRAP's work with Courtauld signatories and other companies to prevent waste at UK 
manufacturing sites. The studies identified the amount of waste created and determined root 
causes of generation. Sustainable solutions were then developed and implemented by the 
organisations to reduce their waste. There are opportunities to prevent waste within an individual site or business and across 
supply chains. Working collaboratively across a supply chain can lead to higher levels of 
waste prevention. Under the CC (phase 2) traditional food and packaging waste in the grocery supply chain 
was reduced by 7.4%, exceeding the 5% target. Supply chain waste decreased by 217,000 
tonnes per year over the period (WRAP, 2013e). Specific examples of success include a major manufacturer of pre-prepared foods 
identifying how to cut food waste by 25% after a 3 month project, and a retailer and supplier 
working together to optimise how bananas were supplied to store, and identifying how to PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 41 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 reduce waste by 90%. A similar exercise with bagged salad suggested waste could be reduced 
by between a third and 80%. More recently WRAP founded The Product Sustainability Forum (PSF) 17 , a collaboration 
of organisations made up of grocery and home improvement retailers and suppliers, 
academics, NGOs and UK Government representatives, which provides a platform for these 
organisations to work together to measure, improve and communicate the environmental 
performance of the grocery and home improvement products (which includes the reduction in 
waste). 
In 2013 a major report was published, 'An initial assessment of the environmental impact 
of grocery products', and a range of practical materials to help implement changes to reduce 
impact. A range of 'pathfinder' projects have been initiated aimed at preventing waste and 
improving resource efficiency by identifying and implementing specific solutions to 
waste/resource hotspots and root causes across the supply chain. The projects will also inform 
the development of transferable learnings and a replicable approach for implementing whole 
chain resource efficiency. As an example, The Co-operative Group is engaging internal 
stakeholders across its entire fresh potato value chain, from farm to fork, to identify and 
implement opportunities to prevent waste and improve wider resource efficiency (energy 
consumption, water consumption and GHG emissions). The intention is that the learnings 
from this exercise will be replicated across other fresh produce in the future. (3) Hospitality and food service food waste The Hospitality and Food Service Agreement (HaFSA), launched in June 2012, is a 
voluntary agreement to support the sector in reducing waste and recycling more, and has 
targets to reduce food and associated packaging waste by 5% and increase recycling rate to 
70% or more by the end of 2015. The Agreement now has 175 signatories and supporters, 
covering 24% of the sector by turnover, and is flexible to allow any size of organisation to 
sign up, from multi-national companies to smaller businesses, from sector 
wholesalers/distributors to trade bodies. Signatories and supporters work towards delivering 
collective goals, and also influence their peers and supply chains, therefore accelerating 
change across the sector. Working groups encourage collaborative action delivering 
accelerated change, and the development of innovative approaches to address existing gaps in 
sector knowledge, which currently act as barriers to change. Interim results are not yet available, but there are a range of published case studies 
detailing successful approaches to reduce waste, for example a meal supplier to the public 
sector cut waste by 60% through small changes to the size of cooking batches. 18 17.

The voluntary approach Based on the experience in the United Kingdom, we would highlight the following factors 
as important for successfully reducing food waste: 
 An evidence-based strategy, to identify priorities, build a persuasive case for action, 
develop clear and robust recommendations and inform the development of effective 
messages and materials for engaging with consumers, industry and other stakeholders. 
 An integrated approach, looking across the whole supply chain (recognising the 
influence those at any given stage in the supply chain can have on others in the supply 
chain), and also in terms of householders incorporating three key elements (national / 
large scale awareness raising campaigns, local / community engagement to influence 
behaviours and changes to products, packaging and labelling to make it easier to buy the 
right amounts of food and use what is bought), which if implemented together deliver 
much more than any element in isolation. 
 A framework for action, such as the CC and HaFSA, with collective targets which 
provides a mechanism for sharing best practice and facilitating the uptake of 
recommendations for change. 
 Monitoring and reporting, to assess progress against targets, allow changes in action to 
be made in response to this and to recognise (publically) achievements (show what can be 
done) and benefits of taking action. The United Kingdom has worked successfully with industry to reduce supply chain food 
and packaging waste by nearly 10% (2009 to 2012), while household food waste is down by 
even more -15% between 2007 and 2012. The latest results from the CC show that the 
voluntary approach can deliver real reductions in waste, while allowing businesses to reduce 
waste and be more efficient and competitive. Business continues to value the voluntary 
agreement form as one where they can receive impartial information and tools, and work 
together with their supply chains for a common aim. As well as the continuation of the CC to 
reduce food and packaging waste in the retail and manufacturing sector, the United Kingdom 
has launched a further voluntary agreement which takes the same approach with the 
hospitality and food service sector. The impact of CC3 is predicted to be a cumulative reduction of 1.1 Mt of waste, 2.9 Mt of 
CO 2 e and a cost benefit of GBP 1.6 billion to consumers, the food and drink sector and local 
authorities. During the three phases of the CC, a 20% reduction in household food waste is 
expected to be achieved. The new HaFSA is a voluntary agreement with the hospitality and food service sector, 
which includes restaurants, hotels, caterers and pubs. This agreement supports the sector in 
preventing and recycling food and packaging waste. There is now about 24% coverage of the 
sector by food and drink sales (with over 170 signatories and supporters). The target is 25%. Voluntary agreements can be effective in achieving policy aims in certain circumstances. 
Some voluntary schemes in the United Kingdom, such as the CC have proven effective in 
reducing waste production. This approach does not just allow improvements to be made as a result of specialist 
advice from WRAP as it also provides a safe forum for signatories to share knowledge and 
best practice. The targets are for signatories to reach as a whole so it's important to 
promulgate best practice horizontally and vertically through the supply chain. The advantage 
of a voluntary approach is that it allows businesses to make informed decisions, which should 
generally result in efficiency savings for the business. Partners are engaged as they have made 
a specific commitment to make improvement to processes to reduce waste. PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM – 43 OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 WRAP's LFHW campaign helps consumers to make informed choices on reducing food 
waste. LFHW has established a respected, credible and effective brand, materials and 
messages, working in partnership with a broad range of organisations (e.g. local councils, 
retailers and the food supply chain). Through LFHW, consumers have been helped to save 
money and waste less food by a combination of helpful advice, tools (meal planning; 
portioning) and simple but inspiring recipe ideas. LFHW messages have been used by CC signatories as a key tool to meet the household 
food waste target. This demonstrates the joined up approach whereby retailers have targets for 
both supply chain and for households, so extending the reach beyond merely reducing their 
own waste but also in influencing and considering the potential indirect effects of the actions 
of signatories. While CC is a UK based agreement it provides opportunities beyond that. The operations 
of many signatories extend beyond UK borders, and so opportunities exist for these partners 
to apply such knowledge beyond their UK operations. While the primary focus is waste prevention, a resilient supply chain will always have 
some surplus. WRAP has worked with industry to assess how much good quality surplus food 
that would otherwise have gone to waste can be made available for redistribution. An industry 
working group led by WRAP has agreed a set of guiding principles that the wider industry 
can sign up to. These principles will help industry to communicate how they prioritise 
redistribution for human consumption internally and externally. CC3 encourages action in line 
with the waste hierarchy. If surplus food cannot be prevented, the next best option is to ensure 
it is redistributed for human consumption. As the voluntary approach allows for information sharing between businesses, this allows 
better interventions across the waste hierarchy. Companies should apply the waste hierarchy 
but as this collaborative approach provides a forum, by sharing best practice this provides 
opportunities to correctly manage waste, when it arises, so surplus food can be redistributed to 
people, or for animal feed if it is not suitable for human consumption, otherwise Anaerobic 
Digestion or composting are preferable alternatives to landfilling. To attempt the same gains 
from regulation would not necessary bring such collaboration as shared voluntary targets 
which signatories need to work together to meet. 2.6. 
Challenges and opportunities for the future While the United Kingdom has made positive progress in reducing food waste, it is likely 
that further reduction will become increasingly challenging (for example as the 'quick wins' 
will have been achieved). There will be a point at which the benefit from further reductions 
may be outweighed by the resource used to achieve that reduction, but we do not believe we 
have yet reached that point. However, the rate of reduction is likely to reduce as that point is 
approached. The European Commission's recent Circular Economy package (2014) includes a 
proposal for an aspirational objective of a 30% reduction in food waste by 2025. A reduction 
of 30% by 2025, from 2007 levels (when the United Kingdom ramped up efforts to decrease 
food waste), could be achieved but would be extremely challenging. The new report by 
WRAP (2014d) provides an analysis of potential future reductions in food waste in the United 
Kingdom, and the associated costs and benefits. Population growth will limit the absolute reductions possible as demand for food 
increases. This is likely to have two effects a) to increase unavoidable food waste as this is 
primarily influenced by population size and overall amounts of food purchased, and b) make 
percentage reduction in overall food waste more challenging as the increased demand will act 
to counterbalance any reducing effect on avoidable waste (for example between 2007 and 44 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 2012 avoidable food waste at a household level reduced by 24% in the United Kingdom, but 
21% at a national level as the population increased by around 4% over that period). External economic factors such as economic growth and any potential fall in food prices 
could result in some behavioural reversion as economic factors become less significant 
drivers to encourage households to reduce waste. WRAP has been having discussions with governments and industry stakeholders about a 
new framework for collaborative action in the United Kingdom to follow the third phase of 
CC, which is proposed to be a ten-year framework (2016-2025) for collaborative action across 
the food and drink life-cycle, helping businesses to become more resilient to future changes in 
supply and demand. Targets have not yet been agreed but one area of focus is likely to be a 
continued reduction in food waste (WRAP, 2014f). 2.7. 
Implications of reductions in food waste An analysis of the amounts (tonnage) of food and drink bought in the UK does show a 
significant reduction, at a household level, of around 4% between 2007 and 2012. This 
reduction is consistent with consumers having to buy less (as they waste less), but will of 
course also have been influenced by other initiatives such as those aimed at promoting healthy 
eating. However, population growth has meant there was only a reduction of ca 0.5% at a UK 
level, suggesting that an increase in population (of 4.4%) has off-set most of the reduction due 
to less food being wasted. 19 The UK population is forecast to grow by 6.1 million people by 
2025, a 10% increase, and would (with current consumption patterns) require need an extra 
4.1 Mt of food; much more than the further reduction in food waste thought possible by that 
time (1.7 Mt). In addition econometric modelling (WRAP, 2014c) suggests that as consumers find ways 
to avoid waste, many change their purchasing behaviour and buy smaller quantities of more 
expensive food, which is a form of  " trading up. "  It would be useful to develop further 
understanding of such behaviours to quantify the economic effect of reducing food waste. Reducing waste in manufacture or the grocery retail and hospitality and food service 
supply chains will deliver financial savings, and the potential for increases in productivity and 
competitiveness. The UK currently has a food trade deficit of around GBP 19 billion (the 
same value as that for food wasted across the supply chain), and therefore there should also be 
opportunities to reduce dependency on food imports (for some food types) and increase 
exports. 19.

Details of UK food waste and related materials, by supply chain stage (horizontal) and utilisation or disposal route (vertical) 48 – PREVENTING FOOD WASTE: CASE STUDIES OF JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES PAPER N°76 © OECD 2015 Notes to Annex 2A Table Figures in black are the breakdown of the total food waste (figures in black and bold). The fractions of the total food waste that could be prevented are shown in red, and are a fraction of the total 
food waste (and should not be added to the figures in black or blue). Figures in blue are materials arising from food manufacture but not classed as food waste, and are therefore 
not included in the total food waste figures in black. 1. 
Includes both avoidable (4.2 Mt) and possibly avoidable (1.2 Mt) food waste (items which some people 
may eat, some of the time, including potato peelings, bread crusts), but the financial value is based on 
the avoidable fraction only. 2. 
The value of food waste in the HaFS sector is based on both avoidable and unavoidable food waste (as 
this sector probably has the greatest scope to reduce unavoidable food waste through altered 
procurement, or to make use of this fraction of food waste). 3. 
This covers food waste fed to pets and other animals, most of which is likely to leave the 'food chain' and 
should therefore be considered as waste diversion. 4. 
This covers food redistributed for human consumption, which was estimated to be around 3,000 tonnes 
in 2011, but this will now be an underestimate. 5. 
This consists of 0.45 Mt of food used as animal feed (this is therefore not classed as food waste, but 
could be added to the 3.9 Mt of food waste to give a total indication of food lost to the human food chain; 
and food redistributed for human consumption, which was estimated to be around 3,000 tonnes in 2011, 
but this will now be an underestimate). 6. 
This includes 0.5 Mt of food waste collected separately by local authorities and 0.5 Mt of food waste 
home composted. 7. 
In WRAP's research it was not possible to identify the disposal route for much of the food waste from 
retail, but information from Courtauld signatories suggests that most is recycled (via AD or composting) 
although some may be disposed of via thermal treatment or to landfill. 8. 
Based on 2010 UK data as submitted to Eurostat, which shows 24% of household mixed waste being 
incinerated and 76% going to landfill 9. 
In WRAP's published research it was not possible to identify the disposal route for around 0.2 Mt of food 
waste from the manufacturing sector, but information from Courtauld signatories suggests this is unlikely 
to be disposed of to landfill, and so this has been included within the estimate for food recovery. 10. Estimates under the total column are indicated as minima, due to the absence of detailed data from on 
farm. 11. Examples include spent grain from brewing and dried sugar beet pulp 12. For food waste arising in manufacturing it is assumed that all is avoidable, as the vast majority of what 
would be unavoidable is not classed as a waste but a by-product of some sort. It is possible that a small 
proportion of manufacturing waste is unavoidable though it appears that the majority of this material is 
disposed to animal feed. Note – For households, food waste fed to pets and other animals has been included in the overall 
estimate for waste; whilst commercial food and related by-products used as animal feed are not classed 
as waste (as this is defined as a waste prevention activity). Estimates have been rounded and may not 
therefore add up to the total estimate for any given sector. Source material Households ('Household Food and Drink Waste in the UK 2012'; WRAP, 2013b). Hospitality and Food Service ('Overview of Waste in the UK Hospitality and Food Service Sector'; WRAP, 2013c; data
