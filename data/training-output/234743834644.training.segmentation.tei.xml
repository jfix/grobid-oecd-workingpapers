Lakshmanan <lb/>Boston University Center for Transportation Studies <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Assessments of the economic benefits of transportation infrastructure investments are critical to good <lb/>policy decisions. At present, most such assessments are based of two types of studies: micro-scale studies <lb/>in the form of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and macro-scale studies in the form of national or regional <lb/>econometric analysis. While the former type takes a partial equilibrium perspective and may therefore <lb/>miss broader economic benefits, the latter type is too widely focused to provide much guidance <lb/>concerning specific infrastructure projects or programs. Intermediate (meso-scale) analytical frameworks, <lb/>which are both specific with respect to the infrastructure improvement in question and comprehensive in <lb/>terms of the range of economic impacts they represent, are needed. This paper contributes to the <lb/>development of meso-scale analysis via the specification of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) <lb/>model that can assess the broad economic impact of improvements in transportation infrastructure <lb/>networks. The model builds on recent CGE formulations that seek to capture the productivity penalty on <lb/>firms and the utility penalty on households imposed by congestion (Meyers and Proost, 1997; Conrad, <lb/>1997) and others that model congestion via the device of explicit household time budgets (Parry and <lb/>Bento, 2001, 2002). The centerpiece of our approach is a representation of the process through which <lb/>markets for non-transport commodities and labor create derived demands for freight, shopping and <lb/>commuting trips. Congestion, which arises due to a mismatch between the derived demand for trips and <lb/>infrastructure capacity, is modeled as increased travel time along individual network links. Increased <lb/>travel time impinges on the time budgets of households and reduces the ability of transportation service <lb/>firms to provide trips using given levels of inputs. These effects translate into changes in productivity, <lb/>labor supply, prices and income. A complete algebraic specification of the model is provided, along with <lb/>details of implementation and a discussion of data resources needed for model calibration and application <lb/>in policy analysis. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>Most contemporary assessments of the economic effects of transportation infrastructure <lb/>investments fall into two major categories, one at the micro-scale and the other at the macro-scale. Micro-<lb/>scale assessments follow the procedures of cost-benefit analysis (CBA). They use information on the <lb/>likely outcomes of a proposed project – its effect on travel times, traffic flows, emissions, accidents, etc. – <lb/>to estimate a pecuniary value of its lifetime benefit. That benefit estimate is then contrasted with lifetime <lb/></body>

			<body>project costs to determine whether it is economically productive. Such ex ante analyses are often required <lb/>as a justification for devoting public funds to a proposed project. (For a review see Mackie and Nellthorp, <lb/>2001.) <lb/>Macro-scale studies include econometric analyses that relate the aggregate investment in (or stock <lb/>of) transportation infrastructure to economy-wide measures of economic performance. For the most part, <lb/>they specify production or cost functions in which public infrastructure is regarded as an input to <lb/>production by private firms in a region or nation. The estimated production and cost functions provide <lb/>evidence of the contribution that infrastructure investment makes towards augmenting the productivity of <lb/>private firms and, in some cases, make it possible to calculate a rate of return on aggregate infrastructure <lb/>investment. (For a review see Lakshmanan and Anderson, 2002.) <lb/>The two approaches are complementary. Micro-scale analyses have the advantage of being able <lb/>to measure the impacts of adding or improving a specific infrastructure element, but the scope of their <lb/>economic assessment is limited to effects on users of the element in question or closely related elements <lb/>and to firms and individuals in its immediate locale. The macro-scale analyses capture a broader range of <lb/>economic impacts, but they treat infrastructure investment as a homogenous good (measured in dollars or <lb/>network miles.) and are therefore of little use for assessing the worth of specific investments. Further, the <lb/>macro-scale approach sheds little, if any, light on the mechanisms that drive the observed economic <lb/>impacts. <lb/>To provide a more complete picture of the economic impacts of infrastruture, an intermediate <lb/>level of analysis is needed. For convenience, we refer to this level as &quot; meso-scale, &quot; although models in <lb/>this category might be applied at a variety of geographical scales. We define three requisites for models <lb/>in this class. <lb/>1. Unlike macro-scale analyses they should incorporate information about specific additions or <lb/>improvements to transportation infrastructure networks (although not necessarily at the level of detail <lb/>found in micro-scale analyses.) <lb/></body>

			<page>2 <lb/></page>

			<body>2. They should trace the economic processes that are triggered by infrastructure improvements. (As we <lb/>will explain below, these may take the form of static general equilibrium effects or dynamic <lb/>developmental effects.) <lb/>3. Finally, in order to assess the relative magnitude of different economic mechanisms and to inform <lb/>policy, they should be amenable to empirical implementation using data that are either available or <lb/>obtainable at reasonable cost. <lb/>As a contribution toward the development of meso-scale analyses, we introduce a computable <lb/>general equilibrium (CGE) model that incorporates a number of novel mechanisms for tracing the effects <lb/>of additions to the capacity of a transport network through the broader economy. Infrastructure <lb/>investments are modeled as reducing travel times over links in a network. The key novelty is to <lb/>incorporate travel time explicitly in the utility and profit maximization problems of households and firms. <lb/>For households, travel time for commuting and consumption activities enters a time budget that also <lb/>includes time devoted to work and leisure. For firms providing transportation services, travel time affects <lb/>the number of trips that can be provided by a given stock of vehicles, which in turn affects the prices of <lb/>intermediate and final goods. <lb/>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 discuss the broad economic <lb/>impacts of transportation infrastructure and the state of the art in assessing those impacts. Section 4 <lb/>reviews the relatively brief literature on assessing economic impacts of infrastructure investment with a <lb/>CGE framework. Section 5 constitutes the meat of the paper, presenting an overview of our model, a <lb/>complete algebraic specification, details of implementation and a discussion of data needs. Section 6 <lb/>provides a discussion and summary. <lb/>2. CONTEXT: THE BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE <lb/>INVESTMENT <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>The role of transportation infrastructure in the economy is multifaceted and plays out over a long period <lb/>of time. It is unlikely that any modeling framework can capture all possible mechanisms. For our purpose, <lb/>it is useful to make a distinction between two classes of economic impacts, which we call static general <lb/>equilibrium impacts and dynamic developmental impacts. Static general equilibrium impacts comprise a <lb/>broad range of effects coursing through the economy consequent on the time and monetary savings <lb/>induced by the infrastructure improvements. Such temporal and monetary savings alter, in turn, the <lb/>marginal costs of transport producers, individuals&apos; mobility and the demand for goods and services in the <lb/>context of lowered congestion. As these changes ripple through the market mechanisms, endogenous <lb/>changes occur in employment, output, and incomes. Dynamic developmental impacts ensue from the <lb/>mechanisms set in motion when transport infrastructure improvements activate a variety of interacting <lb/>processes that yield over time many sectoral, spatial, and regional effects which augment productivity. <lb/>They produce transformations in the structure and pattern of the economy – such as changes in the spatial <lb/>pattern of production; creation of new industries and inter-industry linkages; changes in the lifestyles and <lb/>preferences of households; and the evolution of institutions and markets. While static general equilibrium <lb/>impacts arise from the actions of a well-defined set of economic agents through the medium of markets, <lb/>dynamic developmental impacts involve complex interactions of economic, social, cultural and <lb/>institutional factors and are more idiosyncratic in nature. We therefore attempt to capture only the former <lb/>category of impacts in the CGE model. <lb/>General equilibrium effects occur within a system of market relationships that is stable and <lb/>relatively well understood. Most economic activities require some movement of goods and people. <lb/>Production requires the movement of intermediate inputs to the production site, the movement of workers <lb/>back and forth between their homes and places of employment (commuting) and the movement of <lb/>finished goods to market. Consumption activities also require movement as in the case of household trips <lb/>for shopping and recreation. To the extent that improvements to transportation infrastructure reduce the <lb/>cost of movement of goods and people, they affect the levels of economic activity in all parts of the <lb/>economy. <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>A number of general equilibrium mechanisms are described in detail below. But for the purpose <lb/>of illustration, consider the effect of infrastructure on employment. Most transportation analyses start with <lb/>the explicit or implicit assumption that the number of people who commute to work over a given network <lb/>is fixed. In an economy like the US, however, labor supply is by no means perfectly inelastic because <lb/>significant segments of the population, such as mothers with children and individuals past the normal <lb/>retirement age, face decisions as to whether to enter or remain in the labor force. Labor supply is normally <lb/>associated with the wage, but since commuting represents a significant cost of labor force participation, <lb/>infrastructure improvements could entice more people to work. Of course, in a general equilibrium <lb/>framework this would represent a shift in the labor supply function, which in turn would affect the <lb/>equilibrium wage and employment level. <lb/>A peculiar aspect of transportation infrastructure investments is that the cost reductions they <lb/>generate are often realized in time savings rather than monetary savings. Returning to the commuting <lb/>example, a road expansion that relieves congestion might have a minor effect on a commuter&apos;s out of <lb/>pocket cost (e.g. lower fuel costs due to efficiency improvements that stem from changes in the driving <lb/>cycle) but a major effect on commuting time. Time is a scarce resource for any potential worker, so less <lb/>time spent commuting means more time is available for work, leisure, consumption activities, childcare, <lb/>etc. Thus, in assessing the general equilibrium impacts of transportation infrastructure, the household time <lb/>budget is as important as the household expenditure budget. Depending on the magnitude of the wage <lb/>relative to the marginal utility of leisure, the impact of the decrease in commuters&apos; time costs on the labor <lb/>supply may be larger than that of their pecuniary savings. <lb/>A general equilibrium perspective on transportation infrastructure recognizes that reductions in <lb/>the pecuniary and time costs of transportation can lead to increases in the levels of various economic <lb/>activities and thereby to increased derived demand for transportation services. Thus, induced traffic flows <lb/>are a natural outcome of market mechanisms. To many transportation analyses, such flows are seen as <lb/>negating benefits from transportation infrastructure. A project whose congestion reduction effect <lb/>disappears due to increased traffic within a few years of its implementation is seen as a failure. This point <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>of view may be appropriate from an environmental perspective, where the goal of the project is to reduce <lb/>emissions via improved traffic flow, but there are conceptual difficulties from a broad economic <lb/>perspective. Induced trips are derived from increases in economic activities (labor supply, production, <lb/>consumption, recreation) that lead to increased welfare, so as long as there are more trips there is <lb/>presumably a benefit. This has an important implication: from a broader economic perspective, the <lb/>benefits of a transportation infrastructure project cannot be assessed solely in terms of resultant travel <lb/>time savings. This is especially true over the medium to long run, when the additional economic activity <lb/>made possible by the expansion of infrastructure capital stock increases the derived demand for <lb/>transportation to the point where it once again approaches the transportation network&apos;s capacity. <lb/>The fact that we do not try to capture dynamic developmental impacts in the CGE model is not <lb/>meant to detract from their importance. Impacts of this type are most pronounced in low-income <lb/>countries, where infrastructure improvements often represent significant and non-marginal enhancements <lb/>of infrastructure capacity, which (along with the transport services they make possible) can facilitate <lb/>interregional trade and integration. As infrastructure and service improvements lower money and time <lb/>costs and increase accessibility to various market actors—input suppliers, workers and customers— <lb/>market expansion, increased interregional integration and sustaining growth occurs over time. The <lb/>underlying mechanisms include gains from trade, technology shifts, and gains from agglomeration <lb/>supported by transport. A well-studied example of such developmental transformation is the experience of <lb/>the U. S. Midwest consequent on a 400% expansion of the rail network between 1848 and 1860 – <lb/>essentially linking the Midwest to Northeastern U. S. and the world economy. There is considerable <lb/>evidence that the development of railroads accelerated the settlement, agricultural expansion, and growth <lb/>and diversification of manufacturing, and initiated dynamic sequences that integrated the New England <lb/>and Mid-Atlantic regions with the Midwest (Fogel, 1964, Fishlow 1965, Lakshmanan and Anderson <lb/>2007). A more recent example of such developmental effects of major road investments is discernable in <lb/>Sri Lanka (Gunasekara, Anderson and Lakshmanan 2007 forthcoming). The broader literature on <lb/>transport and economic development suggests that transport infrastructure facilitates the transformation of <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>low-income economies from subsistence to commercial agriculture, the development of basic, transport-<lb/>intensive industries and the growth of cites (Haynes and Button, 2001). <lb/>It would be a mistake to think that developmental impacts occur only at an early stage of <lb/>economic development. Even in a mature economy, transportation infrastructure improvements might <lb/>promote structural changes such as increased decentralization or agglomeration of economic activity; <lb/>changes in the way business enterprises conduct operations such as inventory management, logistics and <lb/>other practices; enhanced opportunities for face-to-face interaction; and a range of new recreational <lb/>opportunities (Anderson and Lakshmanan, 2007.) These impacts, which affect the long-term evolution of <lb/>the economy, are difficult to measure and even more difficult to predict. Nevertheless they are important, <lb/>and a better understanding of developmental effects should lead to better decision-making on <lb/>transportation infrastructure. <lb/>3. CONVENTIONAL METHODS OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT <lb/>As we have stated earlier, current methods of impact assessment include the micro-scale CBA <lb/>and macro-scale econometric studies. CBA is nearly universal as a means of assessing the desirability of <lb/>specific projects. Conceptually, economic benefits are assessed as the consumer surplus, defined in <lb/>relation to the demand curve for the infrastructure facility in question. The effect of the infrastructure <lb/>improvement is represented as a rightward shift in the infrastructure supply curve, which results in a fall <lb/>in the price of using the facility—usually defined in units of time as opposed to money—for any given <lb/>level of demand. The associated economic benefit thus has two components: one based on the cost <lb/>savings enjoyed by the number of travelers who used the facility prior to the improvement, and a second <lb/>representing the benefits to new travelers who now choose to use the facility because of its lower price. <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Since the benefit is calculated in terms of time savings, it is necessary to apply a value of time to <lb/>recast the total benefit in monetary terms so that it can be compared against the project&apos;s cost. Benefits <lb/>may also be adjusted for the value of environmental externalities and traffic accidents. Since benefits <lb/>accrue annually over the lifetime of the facility and most costs are incurred at the beginning of its <lb/>lifetime, present values of the flows of benefits and costs are calculated to make them comparable. <lb/>In practice, the result of CBA can be highly sensitive to the assumed value of time and discount <lb/>rates. If these values are accurate, however, the beauty of CBA lies in the theoretical argument that <lb/>consumer surplus, which is a measure of travelers willingness-to-pay, captures the full range of economic <lb/>benefits.1 For example, other measurable benefits, such as property appreciation near the improved <lb/>facility, are chiefly outcomes of reduced travel time so including them in benefit calculation constitutes <lb/>double-counting (Forkenbrock and Foster, 1990). <lb/>Even proponents of CBA concede that there are broader economic impacts that are not captured, <lb/>but argue that the magnitude of these impacts for any particular project is probably small (Mackie and <lb/>Nellthorp, 2001). But such impacts summed across a number projects may be substantial, which suggests <lb/>that CBA is more appropriate for assessing individual projects than for assessing a program of <lb/>infrastructure spending. As an indication that certain broader impacts are excluded from CBA results, <lb/>notice that economic benefits are measured almost exclusively in terms of time savings. As we noted <lb/>earlier, general equilibrium benefits can accrue even in the absence of time savings. <lb/>To the extent that an infrastructure spending program significantly influences relative prices, its <lb/>effects are likely to be felt in markets that are removed from those under the narrow consideration of <lb/>micro-level CBA. (e.g., consider the impacts on West-coast commodity markets of a significant <lb/>infrastructure investment at the Port of Long Beach.) In such cases, analysis which (i) ignores changes in <lb/>prices by treating the latter as strictly exogenous and (ii) considers only those impacts which are spatially <lb/>or temporally proximate—or confined to transportation or related sectors—may well fail to fully account <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 The theoretical justification rests on the assumption of perfect competition. Venables and Gasiorek (1999) develop <lb/>a theoretical framework for assessing impacts under the assumption of monopolistic competition. <lb/></note>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>for the benefits of the investment in question. In traditional CBA the issue boils down to the conditions <lb/>under which the value of time is a theoretically valid measure of for the monetary impacts of these myriad <lb/>inter-market adjustments, and the extent to which these conditions are likely to be satisfied in practice. <lb/>Macro-scale assessments of the economic impact of productivity analysis generally take the form <lb/>of production and cost functions in which transportation infrastructure is included as an argument on the <lb/>right-hand-side. (For a review see Lakshmanan and Anderson, 2002.) Despite their rigorous grounding in <lb/>economic theory, there is a &quot; black-box &quot; quality about them because public capital does not function like <lb/>private capital in the production technology. For example, no firm has exclusive use of a highway, and for <lb/>any firm one might consider, there are large segments of the highway network that it does not use at all. <lb/>Still, a firm might benefit from a highway that it does not use directly via the indirect means of reduced <lb/>input costs. Clearly the mechanisms by which private productivity is enhanced by transportation <lb/>infrastructure are varied and complex. Thus, a positive output elasticity tells us that some economic <lb/>benefit is occurring, but sheds little light on the underlying mechanisms (Anderson and Lakshmanan, <lb/>2007). In particular, it is often very difficult to discern how much of the observed impact is due to <lb/>developmental as opposed to general equilibrium influences. <lb/>A further limitation of macro-level studies is that they treat transportation infrastructure as a <lb/>homogeneous good that can be measured in dollar terms. Such a measurement has some validity in the <lb/>case of private capital, because it is not unreasonable to assume that the value of a capital good reflects its <lb/>competitively determined marginal revenue product. In the case of transportation infrastructure, which is <lb/>allocated via mechanisms that are likely to emphasize distributional goals or political expediency over <lb/>economic efficiency, such an assumption is questionable. It is highly likely that investments of some <lb/>types and in some locations are more productive than others. <lb/>In short, the results of macro-studies point to an important relationship between public capital and <lb/>private productivity, but provide little in the way of either explanation or policy guidance. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. A REVIEW OF GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSES OF CONGESTION <lb/>We focus our attention on two sets of simulation studies, which develop models of the interplay <lb/>between infrastructure and congestion at the level of the aggregate economy. The first, by Mayeres and <lb/>Proost (1997), Conrad, 1997 and Conrad and Heng (2000), define an explicit index of congestion (Z), <lb/>modeled a function of the level of utilization of aggregate transportation infrastructure or capacity, where <lb/>the latter is expressed in terms of either aggregate transport activity or the size of the vehicle capital stock. <lb/>Congestion incurs a productivity penalty on firms and a utility penalty on consumers. The former <lb/>manifests itself through the reduced speed with which firms are able to ship their goods to market, while <lb/>the latter does do via the diminished quality of transport services consumed by households. The second <lb/>set of studies (Parry and Bento, 2001; 2002) model congestion through the device of an explicit <lb/>household time budget. Increases in travel times with the expansion of transport activity cause a reduction <lb/>in labor supply and the consumption of both leisure and services of transport producers. <lb/>Mayeres and Proost (1997) construct a stylized applied general equilibrium model which captures <lb/>the essence of the congestion problem without simulating the process by which infrastructure spending <lb/>affects the value of time. They consider a simple economy made up of a utility-maximizing representative <lb/>household and two representative firms, summarized algebraically as follows: <lb/>, , , <lb/>max ( , ; <lb/>) <lb/>P <lb/>P <lb/>C <lb/>q R <lb/>U C <lb/>Z q <lb/>ξ <lb/>− <lb/>Λ <lb/>Λ <lb/>(MP1) <lb/>subject to: <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>, ) <lb/>( <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>C q <lb/>R Z f h q <lb/>ϖ <lb/>− <lb/>+ + ≤ <lb/>(MP2) <lb/>q F = f 2 (h 2 ) <lb/>(MP3) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>h h <lb/>H <lb/>+ <lb/>Λ≤ <lb/>+ <lb/>(MP4) <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1/[1 ( <lb/>) /( <lb/>)] <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>Z <lb/>q <lb/>q <lb/>C A P R <lb/>= <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>(MP5) <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>In eq. (MP1) the household derives utility (U) from consumption of a final good (C), passenger <lb/>transport (q P ) and leisure (Λ). Eq. (MP2) says that firm 1 combines inputs of labor (h 1 ) and freight <lb/>transportation (q F ) according to the production function f 1 to produce the final good, which may be <lb/>consumed directly, allocated to passenger transport services, or used to create new transport infrastructure <lb/>(R). Firm 2 produces freight transportation services from labor (h 2 ) according to the production function f 2 <lb/>in (MP3), and the household&apos;s labor endowment (H) constrains labor-leisure choice in (MP4): Eq. (MP5) <lb/>specifies how the imbalance between aggregate transport activity and infrastructure capacity (CAP) gives <lb/>rise to congestion according to a capacity restraint function based on Evans (1992). In turn, Z adversely <lb/>influences both the productivity of the final goods producer and the quality of passenger transport enjoyed <lb/>by the household, according to the elasticities ξ and ϖ, respectively. Infrastructure investment alleviates <lb/>congestion by expanding transit capacity, though at the cost of reduced consumption. <lb/>Conrad (1997) and Conrad and Heng (2002) apply these ideas in the context of a large-scale <lb/>recursive-dynamic CGE model (GEM-E3). They elaborate the mechanisms underlying eq. (MP5) by <lb/>developing an explicit model of the influence of aggregate infrastructure on the utilization of vehicle <lb/>capital stocks. Their economy is made up of a representative utility-maximizing household and j = {1, ..., <lb/>J, Tr} firms, where firm Tr is a producer of transportation services. Firms&apos; capital stocks are partitioned <lb/>into intersectorally mobile &quot; jelly &quot; capital (k j ) and transportation capital (kt j ), which represents vehicles <lb/>and is a fixed factor. In the simplest version of their model the aggregate quantity of transportation <lb/>infrastructure (KI) is constant, and its divergence from the socially optimal level (KI*) is responsible for <lb/>congestion which reduces the productivity of kt: <lb/>1 <lb/>max ( ,..., ; <lb/>) <lb/>j <lb/>J <lb/>Tr <lb/>C <lb/>U C <lb/>C Z C <lb/>ξ <lb/>− <lb/>(CH1) <lb/>subject to <lb/>, <lb/>1 , <lb/>, <lb/>( <lb/>,..., <lb/>; , , ) <lb/>e <lb/>v j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>I j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>v <lb/>X <lb/>C <lb/>f X <lb/>X h k kt <lb/>+ ≤ <lb/>∑ <lb/>(CH2) <lb/>e <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>kt <lb/>kt Z ϖ <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>(CH3) <lb/></body>

The j th firm produces a unique <lb/>good which is both consumed and used as an intermediate input (X i, j ) to the i other firms (CH2). <lb/>Production is described by a nested CES function, f j , which combines intermediate inputs with labor (h j ), <lb/>jelly capital (k j ) and effective units of transportation capital ( ). The latter consists of a benchmark <lb/>quantity of fixed capital ( ) whose productivity is exponentially augmented by infrastructure in (CH4) <lb/>and attenuated by congestion in (CH3). These influences are modulated by the coefficient a and the <lb/>elasticity ϖ, respectively, and the factor exp(–a / KI) &lt; 1 can be interpreted as a capacity utilization <lb/>measure. Equilibrium between the demands for labor, capital and infrastructure and the endowments of <lb/>these factors (H, K and KI) is given by eqs. (CH6)-(CH8), and eq. (CH5) defines congestion in terms of <lb/>the weighted average utilization rate of transportation capital relative to the optimal utilization level, with <lb/>industry weights ω j . Conrad (1997) derives the condition for the optimum (CH9) under the assumption <lb/>that there exists an exogenous government-cum-social planner whose objective is to minimize the <lb/>economy&apos;s total expenditure on transportation. The resulting supply function for KI* is denominated over <lb/>the quantities of firms&apos; transportation capital stocks, their shadow prices ( <lb/>e <lb/>j <lb/>kt <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>This approach has the advantage of being straightforward to numerically parameterize. 2 <lb/>However, its main limitation is that it does not explicitly relate congestion to investment in infrastructure <lb/>and the value of time (e.g., the Lagrange multiplier on eq. (MP4)), whose role in CBA is to indicate when <lb/>the marginal benefits of alleviating the former exceed the marginal costs of the latter. The relevant <lb/>mechanism is captured by the second set of studies, which model the production of travel as requiring <lb/>inputs of time, which explicitly enter into a household time budget constraint. <lb/>Parry and Bento (2001) emphasize the impact of substitution among differentially congested <lb/>modes of travel on time expenditures. Theirs is a stylized model of commuting—production is modeled in <lb/>the simplest possible way and freight transport is not considered. The economy is made up of a utility-<lb/>maximizing household, a final goods producer and three transport firms (indicated by the subscript m), <lb/>each of which corresponds to a particular mode: congested roads (R), public transit (P) and non-congested <lb/>roads (F). <lb/>, , , , <lb/>max <lb/>( , ) <lb/>R <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>C <lb/>q q q <lb/>U C <lb/>Λ <lb/>Λ <lb/>(PB1) <lb/>subject to: <lb/>min( , ) <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>C <lb/>X <lb/>H <lb/>+ <lb/>≤ <lb/>∑ <lb/>Q <lb/>(PB2) <lb/>( , , ) <lb/>R <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>Q f q q q <lb/>= <lb/>(PB3) <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>min( <lb/>/ , / ) <lb/>, <lb/>min[ <lb/>/ , ( <lb/>/ <lb/>, <lb/>) <lb/>] <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>X <lb/>T <lb/>m <lb/>q <lb/>PF <lb/>X <lb/>D T <lb/>q <lb/>m R <lb/>d d <lb/>ν <lb/>τ <lb/>ν <lb/>τ <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>⎧ ⎪ ⎪ <lb/>= ⎨ <lb/>⎪ <lb/>− <lb/>⎪ ⎩ <lb/>(PB4) <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>H <lb/>T <lb/>Λ + <lb/>≤ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ T <lb/>(PB5) <lb/>The household derives utility from consumption of the final good and leisure, (PB1).

For public transit and uncongested roads, trip generation is modeled using a Leontief <lb/>transformation function, whose coefficients (ν m and τ m ) indicate the per-trip expenditures of money and <lb/>time. The implication is that for these modes the level of congestion is exogenous, with constant marginal <lb/>time expenditures τ m . By contrast, on congested roads the level of congestion is endogenous. The <lb/>modeling device used to represent this is the CES aggregator function D, which defines the degree of <lb/>substitutability between travel time and &quot; available road capacity &quot; , given by the linear function d 1 – d 2 q R <lb/>(where d 1 and d 2 are constants). Finally, the time budget constraint (PB5) requires that the sum of labor <lb/>supply, leisure and total commuting time exhaust the household&apos;s time endowment ( T ). <lb/>The simple logic of the model is that production creates a derived demand for transport. As trips <lb/>via congested modes (in this case roads, R) rise, so does congestion, which in turn reduces available <lb/>capacity and time spent traveling by those modes, inducing substitution of trips to less congested <lb/>alternatives. The critical parameters governing this process are the elasticities of substitution among <lb/>transit modes in f and between travel time and unused mode capacity in D, and the coefficients of the road <lb/>availability function. <lb/>Parry and Bento&apos;s (2002) extension enumerates trips on congested freeways (RF) and alternate <lb/>back roads (RB) as additional modes of travel, includes negative externalities such as accidents and air <lb/>pollution (which we indicate using the function E), and represents congestion in terms of travel time using <lb/>a more traditional approach. <lb/>, , <lb/>, <lb/>, , <lb/>max <lb/>( , , ) <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>, , , <lb/>RF <lb/>RB <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>C <lb/>q q q q <lb/>RF <lb/>RB <lb/>P <lb/>F <lb/>U C Q <lb/>E q q q q <lb/>Λ <lb/>Λ − <lb/>(PB1′) <lb/>subject to (PB3), (PB5) and: <lb/>m <lb/>m <lb/>C <lb/>X <lb/>+ <lb/>≤ <lb/>∑ <lb/>H <lb/>(PB2′) <lb/></body>

In particular, the simple representation of production <lb/>fails to capture the way in which travel delays impact firms or may themselves be exacerbated by the <lb/>shipment of finished goods to retail markets or households&apos; retail purchasing behavior. <lb/>Likewise, the specification of substitution possibilities in transportation is simplistic.

			<body>involved. The remainder of the paper addresses these issues and examines their implications for <lb/>constructing large-scale transport-focused CGE models. <lb/>5. A HYBRID MESO-MACRO APPROACH <lb/>Our proposed approach is a hybrid one which seeks to capture meso-level details of <lb/>infrastructure, congestion and transport within the traditional framework of a macro-level CGE model. <lb/>We consider a static economy with N representative profit-maximizing firms, each of which produces a <lb/>single, distinct commodity. Firms and commodities come in two varieties, I non-transport producers and <lb/>their associated goods and services, which we index using the subscript i = {1, ..., I}, and M transport or <lb/>logistics firms and their associated services, which we index with the subscript m = {1, ..., M}. To <lb/>distinguish between firms and the goods which they produce, we introduce the subscript j = {1, ..., I} to <lb/>enumerate non-transport producers. Furthermore, we define the set of transport producers in such a way <lb/>that each firm corresponds to a single disaggregate mode of transit, e.g., rail as well as truck freight <lb/>shippers, air passenger and freight travel, own-supplied passenger road travel using private vehicles, <lb/>purchased local/interurban passenger transit by road and rail, etc. Non-transport firms supply goods and <lb/>services to satisfy the intermediate demands of other firms as well as the final demands of households. <lb/>Transportation firms provide freight transport services to the non-transport firms and passenger transport <lb/>services to households. Households in the economy are modeled as a representative utility-maximizing <lb/>agent who owns the factors of production (hours of labor, H, and capital, K) and rents them out to the <lb/>firms in exchange for factor payments which finance the consumption of commodities. <lb/>The centerpiece of our approach is a representation of the process though which the operation of <lb/>markets for non-transport commodities and labor creates derived demands for transportation. In <lb/>particular, we assume that: <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>(a) Each unit of non-transport commodity requires freight trips to be shipped to sources of intermediate <lb/>or final demand. <lb/>(b) The representative agent&apos;s final purchases of these goods and services require retail shopping trips in <lb/>order for them to be converted into utility, and <lb/>(c) The agent&apos;s rental of labor to firms requires commuting trips. <lb/>The three kinds of mobility are distinguished using the superscripts TF, TC and TH, respectively. <lb/>We assume that households face two budget constraints, a pecuniary constraint that commodity <lb/>purchases not exceed factor income, and a temporal constraint that the duration of travel for shopping and <lb/>commuting, hours of work and leisure not exceed an aggregate endowment of time. The latter sets up a <lb/>tension between travel time expenditures for the purposes of consumption and income generation. For <lb/>households to increase their consumption they need more income, which in the short run can only be <lb/>obtained by renting additional hours of labor to firms, with the possible side-effect of more and/or longer <lb/>journeys to work. However, their ability to earn is constrained by the fact that consuming more non-<lb/>transport goods requires additional retail trips, and concomitant expenditures of time. <lb/>Firms do not have explicit time budgets, nevertheless we assume that time constraints influence <lb/>production in an implicit fashion. We treat non-transport firms as &quot; mills &quot; , whose products are <lb/>manufactured using labor, capital and intermediate inputs from other non-transport firms. In order for <lb/>these products to be consumed they must be shipped to markets, which creates a demand for trips <lb/>supplied by the transportation firms. A key feature of the model is that the latter firms do not produce <lb/>trips directly. Rather, their outputs take the form of generalized transportation services such as vehicles <lb/>operated on the road, trains on tracks, planes in the air, etc.—whose capacity is determined by the firms&apos; <lb/>stocks of transportation capital (i.e., vehicles). This allows us to model the mechanism by which <lb/>congestion imposes a productivity penalty on firms: speed, which along any given segment of the <lb/>transportation network is equivalent to the inverse of the travel time, is necessary to transform these <lb/>services into trips. Thus, given a certain capacity to produce transport services, increases in travel time <lb/>translate into fewer trips. Other things equal, the main consequence is a fall in the productivity of inputs <lb/></body>

			<body>to transportation and in rise in the average cost of trips, a decline in movements of passengers and non-<lb/>transport goods, and a reduction in production and consumption. <lb/>These devices allow us to model the impacts of congestion in a novel way. Congestion is the <lb/>increase in travel time arising out of the imbalance between the aggregate derived demand for mobility <lb/>and the capacity of the stock of transportation infrastructure to support the desired flux of trips. Our way <lb/>of representing travel admits three channels through which congestion may exert a drag on activity, <lb/>corresponding to (a)-(c), above: <lb/>•  An increase in the duration of households&apos; retail trips per unit of consumption, which attenuates<lb/>consumption through the time budget constraint. Depending on the relevant elasticities, the time spent <lb/>on work or leisure may rise or fall as well, but the standard result is a decline in utility. <lb/>•  A reduction in average productivity of transport-producers. Because congestion increases the duration<lb/>of freight trips of a given distance, it reduces the number of trips which transport producers can <lb/>supply with a given fleet of vehicles. The consequent dissipation of operating time—and thus <lb/>revenue—drives a wedge between the marginal cost of each transportation firm&apos;s output and the unit <lb/>value of its trips consumed by firms and households, much like a tax. <lb/>•  Dissipation of time in commuting, acting through the time budget constraint to reduce the economy&apos;s<lb/>aggregate labor supply. This effect is similar to a tax on labor. <lb/>To effectively inform traditional microeconomic cost benefit analysis, any attempt to capture <lb/>these influences using top-down economy-wide models must address a number of issues. First, <lb/>considering the impacts of congestion in the aggregate will yield limited insights, as typically only a <lb/>fraction of the links in an economy&apos;s transport network will be congested. These are the ones which are <lb/>candidates for infrastructure projects. Following from this observation, a second consideration is that trips <lb/>should be thought of as differentiated commodities, whose equilibrium allocation among network links <lb/>will be a function of transport producers&apos; marginal costs, firms and households&apos; demands for goods and <lb/>passenger mobility, and the distribution of travel times/congestion. In general, infrastructure investments <lb/>that are sufficiently large will give rise to simultaneous non-marginal changes in all of these variables, the <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>character of which will depend on both magnitude of the investments and their location on the network. <lb/>Finally, in order to properly capture the dissipative effect of congestion, a distinction needs to be made <lb/>between the production of transport services and the consumption of the trips which they make possible. <lb/>Logistics and passenger transport firms will allocate their outputs to the network segments which yield <lb/>the highest marginal revenue, while households and non-transport firms will allocate their demand for <lb/>trips to links with the lowest marginal cost. The key challenge is therefore to develop a computationally <lb/>tractable way of modeling the equilibrium between the supply-side transformation of transport services to <lb/>trips and the demand-side aggregation of trips into passenger and freight movements so as to resolve the <lb/>substitution of trips from congested links to uncongested alternatives. <lb/>The simplest way of doing this is to keep the spatial details of the network structure to a <lb/>minimum. Our strategy is to assume the existence of a generic transport network with l = {1, ..., L} links, <lb/>amongst which trips generated by the m transport producers are allocated in a competitive fashion. This <lb/>choice allows us to specify a top-down model of intermediate complexity which is able to capture the <lb/>macroeconomic feedbacks which affect—and are affected by—Wardropian equilibria, while serving as a <lb/>bridge to more disaggregate network equilibrium models (e.g., Ferris et al, 1999). We make the key <lb/>simplifying assumption that trips across different mode-link alternatives are imperfect substitutes, with <lb/>differing marginal costs to transport consumers and differing marginal revenues to transport producers. <lb/>Thus, when non-transport firms ship their product to market, or households supply labor or consume a <lb/>particular commodity, each of these actors simultaneously chooses travel distances/routes and modes by <lb/>allocating trips over l and m so as to minimize total transportation expenditure. Symmetrically, each <lb/>logistics or passenger transport firm simultaneously chooses travel distances/routes and payloads by <lb/>allocating the transportation services it produces to trips by l and j in the case of freight, l and i in the case <lb/>of retail shopping, and just l in the case of commuting, so as to maximize revenue. <lb/>We operationalize these ideas by specifying transportation demands as constant elasticity of <lb/>substitution (CES) functions of trips by mode. Thus, freight transport demand by the j th firm, <lb/>, is <lb/>TF <lb/>j <lb/>Q <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>modeled as a CES aggregate of the trips, <lb/>, made by transport mode m on network link l to ship j&apos;s <lb/>product to intermediate and final consumers. Similarly, we model the aggregate household demand for <lb/>transportation to consume the i th commodity, <lb/>, as a CES function of the retail trips, <lb/>, across all <lb/>combinations of transit modes and links, and the aggregate demand for transportation to supply labor, <lb/>Q TH , as a CES function of the various mode-and link-specific commuting trips, <lb/>. We use the same <lb/>device on the supply side, specifying the trips undertaken by each transport producer as a constant <lb/>elasticity of transformation (CET) expansion of that firm&apos;s output. Thus, firm m&apos;s trips <lb/>, <lb/>and <lb/>are modeled as a CET function of the aggregate supply of transportation services by mode, Y m . Parry <lb/>and Bento (2001) note that the ability to substitute between transport modes mitigates the cost of reducing <lb/>congestion. Our assumption that households and firms substitute among both transport modes and <lb/>network segments means that the elasticities in the aforementioned CES and CET functions will likely be <lb/>a key influence on the marginal benefit of investments to increase the capacity of congested links. <lb/>, , <lb/>TF <lb/>j l m <lb/>q <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>Q <lb/>, , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>q <lb/>, <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>q <lb/>, , <lb/>TF <lb/>j l m <lb/>q <lb/>, , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>q <lb/>, <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>q <lb/>The attractive feature of this formulation is that it automatically generates different levels of <lb/>congestion for each transport mode and network link.

			<body>The dependence of capacity on infrastructure investment is an exogenous input to the model that <lb/>must be developed from the existing characteristics of the transit network, the links which are candidates <lb/>for improvement, and the projected changes in traffic flows resulting from the proposed project. Eqs. (1) <lb/>and (2) establish the crucial connection between household trips to consume goods or commute back and <lb/>forth to work, and the trips undertaken by logistics firms to deliver commodities. Growth in any one type <lb/>of transportation adds to the total flux of trips across the transport network, raising trip times, and <lb/>inducing economic actors to re-allocate trips to less congested mode-link alternatives, as well as cut back <lb/>on overall travel. As mentioned above, the consequence of this is a decline in both the quantity of labor <lb/>supplied to producers and the goods and services consumed by households. In this way infrastructure <lb/>capacity acts as a fundamental brake on the expansion of economic activity. <lb/>5.1. <lb/>Algebraic Summary of the CGE model <lb/>We begin with a description of the households in our simulated economy. We assume the <lb/>existence of a representative agent whose utility is represented by the nested CES function shown in <lb/>Figure 1A. At the top level of the nesting hierarchy, the agent obtains utility (U) from non-transport <lb/>consumer commodities ( ) and leisure (Λ), with elasticity of substitution σ U and technical coefficients <lb/>α i and α Λ : <lb/>ˆ <lb/>i <lb/>C <lb/>( ) <lb/>/( <lb/>1) <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>ˆ <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>U <lb/>C <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>α <lb/>α <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>Λ <lb/>= <lb/>+ Λ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>∑ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>. <lb/>(3) <lb/>The second level of the utility hierarchy describes how the demands for commodities create derived <lb/>demands for personal transportation. We specify each unit of delivered commodity as a CES composite of <lb/>transportation services, <lb/>(i.e., trips for the purpose of retail purchases), and the relevant commodity <lb/>( ) whose consumption necessitates transport expenditures, with elasticity of substitution <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>Q <lb/>i <lb/>C 񮽙 <lb/>C <lb/>i <lb/>σ &lt; 1 and <lb/>technical coefficients TC <lb/>i <lb/>β and C <lb/>i <lb/>β : <lb/></body>

Note that eq. (4) <lb/>implicitly captures Lakshmanan and Hua&apos;s (1983) distinction between discretionary and non-<lb/>discretionary transportation: while travel is a necessary input to consumption ( C <lb/>i <lb/>σ &lt; 1) the actual quantity <lb/>of travel undertaken by households is discretionary. Consequently, our formulation captures the ability of <lb/>consumers to substitute passenger travel ( <lb/>) for the freight transportation component of , e.g., by <lb/>opting to travel to retail outlets to purchase goods versus having them delivered directly to the consumer&apos;s <lb/>place of residence. At the lowest level of the hierarchy the transportation services necessary to consume <lb/>good i are a CES composite of the shopping trips ( <lb/>) which occur on each link of the transport <lb/>network and mode of transit: <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>Q <lb/>i <lb/>C 񮽙 <lb/>, , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>q <lb/>( ) <lb/>/( <lb/>1) <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>, , <lb/>, , <lb/>TC <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>TC <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>TC <lb/>TC <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>i m l <lb/>i m l <lb/>l <lb/>m <lb/>Q <lb/>q <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>γ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>. <lb/>(5) <lb/>Here TC <lb/>i <lb/>σ is the substitution elasticity and , , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>γ <lb/>are technical coefficients which indicate how the retail <lb/>trips associated with each commodity are distributed across mode-link alternatives in the benchmark data <lb/>used to calibrate the model. <lb/>Households&apos; rental of their factor endowments is modeled in a similar fashion. We assume that <lb/>transport services are not necessary to supply capital to firms. However, to supply H units of labor the <lb/>agent must utilize transportation services, Q TH (i.e., trips for the purpose of commuting). Accordingly, the <lb/>aggregate supply of labor ( ) is modeled as a CES composite, with elasticity σ H and coefficients β TH <lb/>and β H : <lb/>H 񮽙 <lb/>( ) <lb/>( <lb/>/( <lb/>1) <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>H <lb/>H <lb/>Q <lb/>H <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>) <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>. <lb/>(6) <lb/>22 <lb/>As with retail trips, we model Q TH as a CES composite of the commuting trips ( <lb/>) by each network link <lb/>and transit mode, with elasticity σ TH and mode-link coefficients <lb/>, <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>q <lb/>, <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>γ : <lb/>( ) <lb/>/( <lb/>1) <lb/>( <lb/>1 )/ <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>l m <lb/>l <lb/>m <lb/>Q <lb/>q <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>γ <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>∑∑ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>. <lb/>(7) <lb/>The representative agent&apos;s budget constraint mandates that the value of consumption at retail <lb/>goods prices ( ) exhaust the income from factor rentals: <lb/>i <lb/>P 񮽙 <lb/>i i <lb/>i <lb/>PC <lb/>H rK <lb/>θ <lb/>≤ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ 񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>, <lb/>(8) <lb/>where θ denotes the marginal utility of time—i.e., the wage net of the marginal cost of commuting, and r <lb/>is the capital rental rate.

The assumption of Walrasian competitive <lb/>equilibrium allows us to express the production and aggregation relations in eqs. (3)-(7) and (10)-(14) in <lb/>terms of their dual cost functions and associated conditional input demand functions. The latter can then <lb/>be substituted into the supply-demand balance constraints (6), (8), (9) and (15)-(17) to yield a system of <lb/>nonlinear equations (Ξ) in commodity and factor prices, the activity levels of firms and the income level <lb/>of the representative agent. The result is the Walrasian excess demand correspondence of the economy. <lb/>The advantage of our approach is two-fold. First, on the consumer side, the price variable <lb/>consisting of the Lagrange multiplier on eq. (9) is the endogenous value of time, which takes full account <lb/>of not only the channels through which congestion&apos;s impacts manifest themselves, but also the general <lb/>equilibrium interactions among these effects. Second, in both eq. (9) and the cost functions for transport <lb/>producers (i.e., the dual of eq. (14)) congestion plays the role of a vector of differentiated, link-specific <lb/>taxes on trips. This is very useful, as it enables us to simulate congestion as an endogenous, nonlinear tax <lb/>whose level is determined by trip volumes according to eqs. (1)-(2). <lb/>5.2. <lb/>Data and Calibration <lb/>Numerical solution of the model requires that values be specified for the parameters of the excess <lb/>demand correspondence, Ξ. This procedure, known as calibration, is likely to be especially challenging <lb/>given that it requires the integration of economic and transportation data which are often incommensurate. <lb/></body>

			<body>Calibrating the purely macroeconomic, non-transport related components of the CGE model is a <lb/>fairly simple task, involving the selection of values for the elasticities σ U , <lb/>and <lb/>based on empirical <lb/>estimates, and the computation of values for the coefficients α i , α Λ , δ NT and δ T using a national-or <lb/>regional-level social accounting matrix (SAM). (For details see, e.g., Sue Wing, 2004.) We anticipate that <lb/>it will be somewhat more difficult to find econometric estimates for, or calibrate using related empirical <lb/>studies, values for the substitution elasticities <lb/>, or to infer values for the coefficients <lb/>NT <lb/>j <lb/>σ <lb/>T <lb/>m <lb/>σ <lb/>C <lb/>i <lb/>σ <lb/>TF <lb/>j <lb/>χ , TC <lb/>i <lb/>β and C <lb/>i <lb/>β <lb/>from data on freight transport margins. And since published estimates for the elasticities <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>do not exist, developing the data and econometric procedures to estimate these parameters will likely <lb/>involve a large amount of effort. A rough-and-ready way to proceed is to set up the model using the <lb/>values in the range assumed by Parry and Bento (2001, 2002), and perform sensitivity analysis. <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>σ <lb/>TF <lb/>j <lb/>σ <lb/>TC <lb/>i <lb/>σ <lb/>T <lb/>m <lb/>ψ <lb/>Calibrating the coefficients , , <lb/>TF <lb/>j l m <lb/>γ , , , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>γ , , <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>γ , <lb/>, <lb/>, , <lb/>TF <lb/>j l m <lb/>μ <lb/>, , <lb/>TC <lb/>i l m <lb/>μ and , <lb/>TH <lb/>l m <lb/>μ in the trip aggregation and <lb/>transformation functions is likely to be a significant undertaking. The key difficulty lies in defining the <lb/>topology of the transport network and associated traffic flows at a geographic scale for which there are <lb/>published inter-industry economic accounts. Although survey data on commuting and freight traffic flows <lb/>are readily available at the level of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), input-output data are rarely <lb/>tabulated at such a fine spatial scale.

			<body>the most promising source of economic data would seem to be county-level SAMs developed by <lb/>IMPLAN which are coterminous with MSAs that straddle major transportation corridors in the eastern <lb/>U.S. <lb/>6. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY <lb/>Provision of transportation infrastructure is one of the most visible, vital and costly ways in which <lb/>the public sector contributes to the private economy. Yet decisions about the levels and allocations of <lb/>transportation infrastructure investments must currently be made with incomplete information about their <lb/>economic impacts. Analytical tools are limited to micro-scale analyses, which may not capture the full <lb/>range of economic benefits induced by a project or program, and macro-scale analyses, which are too <lb/>broadly defined to provide guidance on the relative benefits of specific projects and programs. The <lb/>situation calls for analytical tools defined as a &quot; meso-level &quot; that can provide impacts assessments that are <lb/>both comprehensive and capable of representing specific expansions of infrastructure capacity, following <lb/>the three criteria we define in the introduction. This paper contributes to the development of such tools by <lb/>specifying a CGE model that is specifically designed to assess the broader economic impacts of <lb/>transportation infrastructure investments. <lb/>The model specified above draws on the limited CGE literature on transportation <lb/>infrastructure – especially the household time budgets of Parry and Bento (2001, 2002). It goes beyond <lb/>existing models both in terms of its technical specification and its overall scope. It specifies a set of <lb/>derived demands for transportation services that arise from production, consumption and labor supply <lb/>activities. It represents transportation infrastructure as a set of capacitated mode-link combinations on <lb/>which flows are assigned and congestion is modeled as increases in travel time. By embedding travel time <lb/>explicitly in the determination of household utilities and the prices and quantities of commodities <lb/></body>

			<body>produced in the economy, it incorporates in the model the phenomenon of congestion that is based on a <lb/>comprehensive, endogenous definition of the value of time. <lb/>Existing CGE models designed for the analysis of transportation infrastructure can, for the most <lb/>part, be classified s maquettes – that is, simplified or scaled down models designed to make rough <lb/>estimates of relative magnitudes or as steps toward the creation of more comprehensive models. By <lb/>contrast, the model specified above is intended as a practical tool for policy analysis. There are, however, <lb/>significant hurdles to overcome before it can be made operational, including defining an appropriate <lb/>geographical scale for its application, an appropriate level of detail for the set of mode-link combinations <lb/>and appropriate data and parameters for calibration. <lb/>The question that naturally arises is whether it is worth the effort. To some extent this comes <lb/>down to the empirical question of whether the broader economic benefits captured in the CGE model are <lb/>of significant magnitude relative to the more direct effects captured in CBA. But looking beyond the <lb/> &quot; bottom line &quot; of aggregate benefits, the CGE model generates a range of information that cannot be <lb/>obtained from existing models such as whether the benefits of a capacity expansion accrue mostly to <lb/>firms or households, whether household benefits are mostly in consumption activities or commuting and <lb/>whether some industries benefit more than others. Such information may be useful in assessing whether <lb/>specific objectives that policy makers attach to a project are likely to be met. Also, the CGE specification <lb/>is especially well-suited to assessing the impact of infrastructure programs because the implementation of <lb/>two or more capacity expansions can be modeled simultaneously. This will be useful in identifying <lb/>complementarities among projects by seeing, for example, whether the benefits of projects A and B <lb/>implemented simultaneously exceed the sum of the benefits of A and B implemented independently. <lb/>Ultimately, the value of a model such as the one we have specified lies in its laying bare a <lb/>plausible set of economy-wide interactions that are triggered by an improvement in transportation <lb/>infrastructure. In other words, it is an attempt to move beyond &quot; black box &quot; and &quot; bottom line &quot; approaches <lb/>to policy models to an approach that explains rather than just captures economic impacts. Naturally, <lb/>laying the underlying mechanisms bare opens the door to criticism based on underlying assumptions – <lb/></body>

			<body>especially as regards market imperfections. Furthermore, we recognize that there are a range of dynamic, <lb/>developmental impacts that the model does not include. Still, we believe that specifying and calibrating <lb/>our model is a useful step toward a better understanding of the economy-wide consequences of <lb/>transportation infrastructure in the economy. <lb/>7. APPENDIX: IMPLEMENTATIONAL DETAILS <lb/>Walrasian general equilibrium prevails when the price of commodities equals their marginal cost <lb/>of production with firms earning zero profits, there is zero excess demand for commodities and factors, <lb/>and consumer&apos; income equals their expenditure. These conditions form the basis for CGE models in a <lb/>complementarity format, which specify the economy as a vector of zero profit, market clearance, income <lb/>balance, and auxiliary equations. Each equation is paired with an associated dual variable with respect to <lb/>which it exhibits complementary slackness (see, e.g., Rutherford, 1995; Sue Wing, 2004): <lb/>1. Zero profit conditions for firms and households. These specify the equilibrium between commodity <lb/>prices and firms&apos; unit cost functions, and between the marginal utility of income and the aggregate <lb/>expenditure function. They complementary to the activity levels of firms and the utility level of the <lb/>representative agent. <lb/>2. Market clearance conditions for commodities and factors. These specify the equilibrium between the <lb/>aggregate demands for commodities and factors—which are functions of prices and activity levels, <lb/>and their aggregate supplies—typically indicated by firms&apos; activity levels and households&apos; factor <lb/>endowments. They are complementary to commodity and factor prices. <lb/>3. Income balance conditions. These specify the equilibrium between the value of households&apos; <lb/>expenditures and the value of their income, and are complementary to the income levels of the <lb/>households. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Auxiliary equations. These typically represent some sort of constraint on the economy that is a <lb/>function of both an auxiliary variable and other endogenous variables, which requires them to be <lb/>solved for along with the remaining variables. They are complementary to the auxiliary variable.. <lb/>Henceforth we use the shorthand symbol &quot; ⊥ &quot; to represent these complementary relationships. <lb/>7.1. <lb/>Zero Profit Conditions and Associated Demand Functions <lb/>As before, we begin with the households in the economy. Recasting the representative agent&apos;s <lb/>utility maximization problem as a dual expenditure minimization permits us to solve for the unit <lb/>expenditure function, ε, dual to (3): <lb/>1/(1 <lb/>) <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>ˆ <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>P <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>θ <lb/>ε <lb/>α <lb/>α <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>− <lb/>Φ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>∑ <lb/>, <lb/>⊥ U <lb/>(18) <lb/>where <lb/>is the price of the i th consumption good-transport services aggregate, and θ is the value of time. <lb/>This expression can be thought of as a zero-profit condition for the &quot; production &quot; of a utility good, to <lb/>which aggregate utility is the complementary activity variable. By Shepard&apos;s Lemma, the derivatives of <lb/>the zero-profit condition with respect to the prices of the inputs yields the conditional input demands. <lb/>Accordingly, final demands for commodities and leisure are given by: <lb/>ˆ <lb/>i <lb/>P <lb/>ˆ <lb/>ˆ <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>C <lb/>P <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>α <lb/>ε <lb/>− <lb/>= <lb/>U, <lb/>(19) <lb/>U <lb/>U <lb/>U U <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>σ <lb/>α θ ε <lb/>− <lb/>Φ <lb/>Φ = <lb/>, <lb/>(20) <lb/>Cost minimization in the aggregation of transport services and physical goods in eq.

			<body>Because θ is the Lagrange multiplier on a constraint which takes into account the fully endogenous price, <lb/>supply and demand responses across the entire spectrum of markets in the economy (as opposed to just <lb/>transportation), it represents the true general equilibrium value of time. It is also useful to observe that in <lb/>this expression the mode-and link-specific time costs play the role of differentiated taxes, whose values <lb/>are endogenous determined by trip volumes according to the capacity restraint formula (1)-(2). <lb/>The final market clearance condition is a placeholder equation that specifies the quantity of <lb/> &quot; utility goods &quot; as the ratio of the representative agent&apos;s aggregate income, Ω, to the unit expenditure <lb/>index. This expression is complementary to unit expenditure: <lb/>U = Ω / ε. <lb/>⊥ ε <lb/>(54) <lb/>7.3. <lb/>Income Balance Conditions and Auxiliary Variables <lb/>Income-expenditure balance is defined by the representative agent&apos;s money budget constraint, <lb/>(8), which is complementary to aggregate income: <lb/>i i <lb/>i <lb/>PC <lb/>H rK <lb/>θ <lb/>≤ <lb/>+ <lb/>∑ 񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>. <lb/>⊥ Ω <lb/>(8′) <lb/>The auxiliary variables in the model are the average trip times by mode and link (τ l, m ) in eq. (53) and the <lb/>congestion penalty parameter (Z l, m ) in eqs. (32) and (50)-(52). Assuming that Z l, m can be expressed as a <lb/>parametric function of τ l, m (e.g., as in Mayeres and Proost, 1997), we may specify two auxiliary equations <lb/>that are complementary to these variables: <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>4 <lb/>, , <lb/>, , <lb/>, <lb/>0 <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>, <lb/>1 0.15 <lb/>TC <lb/>TF <lb/>TH <lb/>i l m <lb/>i l m <lb/>l m <lb/>i <lb/>l m <lb/>l m <lb/>l m <lb/>q <lb/>q <lb/>q <lb/>τ <lb/>τ <lb/>κ <lb/>+ <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>∑ <lb/>, <lb/>⊥ τ l, m (55) <lb/>Z l, m (τ l, m ). <lb/>⊥ Z l, m (56) <lb/>7.4. <lb/>General Equilibrium in Complementarity Format <lb/>Given the above, we can now specify the general equilibrium of the economy as follows: <lb/></body>
