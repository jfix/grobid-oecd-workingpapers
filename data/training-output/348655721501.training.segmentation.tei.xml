			<body>PREFACE <lb/>Meeting international commitments to development co-operation such as the Millennium <lb/>Development Goals, the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development and the Gleneagles <lb/>G8 summit agreements to increase aid by around $50 billion per year by 2010 will require not <lb/>only increased resources, but also their judicious use. In this context policy makers and others <lb/>cannot limit their attention to the effectiveness of foreign aid alone; they must broaden the <lb/>discussion to include the development-related impacts of a spectrum of rich-country policies, <lb/>including those related to investment, trade and international migration. Such policies can work <lb/>at cross purposes on the ground in developing countries, thwarting poverty reduction and <lb/>hindering economic growth. Yet in most cases the policy impacts have been studied separately or <lb/>independently. The OECD Development Centre&apos;s Policy Coherence activities address this <lb/>knowledge gap by conducting well defined country case studies of the interaction of <lb/>rich-country policies in poor countries (including their interdependence with local policies), in <lb/>close collaboration with researchers and institutions in developing countries. To further that end, <lb/>the Centre has asked leading experts to take stock of what is known about the impact of four key <lb/>vectors of OECD member policies — those governing official development assistance (ODA), <lb/>foreign direct investment (FDI), migration and trade — on development in poor and emerging <lb/>economies. These four background papers, all of which will shortly be available publicly, <lb/>provide a key input into the Centre&apos;s Policy Coherence project. This paper is one of them. <lb/>OECD member policies do sometimes work at cross purposes in their development <lb/>impact. For example, restrictions on developing-country exports under the recently terminated <lb/>Multifibre Agreement (MFA) cost those exporters an estimated $50 billion annually, very <lb/>roughly equal to annual foreign-aid flows to developing countries during the same period. <lb/>Clearly this shows incoherence between trade and aid policies insofar as one objective of policy <lb/>making is to promote economic development. The growing number of African doctors in some <lb/>OECD members suggests another example. It reveals incoherence between foreign-aid policies, <lb/>which seek to increase the supply of health services in poor countries and in many cases pay to <lb/>train doctors, and migration policies, which selectively seek out doctors and provide powerful <lb/>incentives for them to leave their home countries. Of course, OECD member trade and migration <lb/>policies have objectives other than promoting development in poorer countries, and citizens and <lb/>policy makers may decide that in some cases those other objectives are more important than <lb/>development. Yet at the very least, this project seeks to make more explicit the magnitude of the <lb/>trade-offs among policies. What, in short, is the cost of policy incoherence? <lb/>In addition to identifying cases where rich-country policies work at cross purposes, a <lb/>cross-cutting issue is whether policies are complements or substitutes. Policies to promote ODA and <lb/></body>

			<body>FDI, for example, are complementary if aid flows to a country (to finance port infrastructure, say) <lb/>increase the attractiveness of that country as a destination for capital flows. Policies are substitutes if <lb/>the effects of diminished flows from one policy can be offset by increased flows from a second. Many <lb/>observers wonder whether the considerable remittance flows sent home by migrants might substitute <lb/>for foreign aid flows, reducing poverty and financing investment. Of course, the complementarity of <lb/>FDI and ODA or the substitutability of remittances and aid are at this point merely hypotheses. The <lb/>project aims to study such interactions more carefully; this paper provides one input. <lb/>Louka T. Katseli <lb/>Director <lb/>OECD Development Centre <lb/>August 2006 <lb/></body>

			<front>© OECD 2006 <lb/>7 <lb/>RESUMÉ <lb/>Cet article fournit une vue d&apos;ensemble à la fois théorique et pratique des relations existant <lb/>entre les échanges, l&apos;aide et les IDE, à la fois en termes d&apos;interactions politiques et d&apos;interactions <lb/>entre les flux de ressources. Les flux d&apos;aides d&apos;un pays à un autre peuvent avoir des effets <lb/>positifs ou négatifs sur les flux commerciaux des pays concernés. Ces effets peuvent agir à deux <lb/>différents niveaux. Il existe ainsi des liens macroéconomiques entre l&apos;aide et le commerce : l&apos;aide <lb/>fait augmenter l&apos;épargne, ce qui permet plus d&apos;importations, ou alors l&apos;aide fait monter le taux de <lb/>change réel, ce qui diminue les exportations. Il existe également des mécanismes <lb/>microéconomiques : une aide liée peut augmenter les exportations si elle est utilisée pour le <lb/>renforcement des <lb/>capacités productives et commerciales, mais d&apos;autres formes d&apos;aide liée peuvent tout <lb/>simplement aboutir à une inefficacité d&apos;allocation. Les flux d&apos;aide peuvent avoir une influence <lb/>sur les politiques commerciales des pays en développement qui les reçoivent, s&apos;ils agissent via le <lb/>syndrome du « mal hollandais » affectant les termes de l&apos;échange, ou via une aide liée <lb/>explicitement destinée à l&apos;achat des produits des pays donateurs. Les flux d&apos;aides interagissent <lb/>également avec les politiques commerciales de ces pays donateurs ; ainsi, la manière la plus <lb/>brutale d&apos;envisager cette question est peut-être de se demander si un pays en développement <lb/>donnée est mieux placé par l&apos;aide fournie ou par l&apos;accès au marché du pays donateur. La pensée <lb/>économique indique généralement qu&apos;un dollar d&apos;aide procure le même bien-être à un pays <lb/>pauvre qu&apos;un montant considérablement plus important de gains à l&apos;exportation (2.29 dollars <lb/>selon une étude souvent citée). Néanmoins, et sous certaines conditions qui peuvent prévaloir <lb/>dans de nombreux pays, l&apos;accès au marché du pays donateur peut apporter un plus grand <lb/>potentiel de développement ; cela dépend en partie de l&apos;ampleur relative des effets négatifs liés <lb/>aux flux d&apos;aides (par l&apos;intermédiaire du taux de change) et des effets dynamiques positifs de la <lb/>spécialisation des exportations. Une étude empirique sur ces questions semble frustrante étant <lb/>donné le manque de consensus constaté, ce qui peut être en partie dû à la difficulté d&apos;en établir <lb/>les causalités, en d&apos;autres termes de savoir si c&apos;est les échanges qui influe sur l&apos;aide, l&apos;aide qui <lb/>influe sur le commerce, ou s&apos;ils s&apos;influencent chacun mutuellement. <lb/>Cet article aborde ensuite la question des interrelations existant entre les flux d&apos;aide et les <lb/>politiques, et entre les flux d&apos;IDE et les politiques. Bien que l&apos;oeuvre théorique suggère que le <lb/>commerce et les IDE peuvent être à la fois des compléments et des substituts, en pratique il y a <lb/>toutes les raisons de penser que le commerce et les flux d&apos;IDE sont complémentaires. Les <lb/>nouveaux modèles théoriques du commerce suggèrent même que, dans les pays en <lb/>développement, la libéralisation du commerce et des politiques liées aux IDE ne sont pas des <lb/>substituts et qu&apos;elles peuvent avoir des interactions complexes : par exemple, la libéralisation des <lb/>IDE à elle seule peut encourager les IDE « horizontaux » c&apos;est-à-dire dirigés vers le marché, <lb/>tandis qu&apos;une libéralisation coordonnée des IDE et du commerce serait plus à même <lb/>d&apos;encourager les IDE « verticaux », à savoir destinés à une réduction des coûts. <lb/></front>

			<body>SUMMARY <lb/>This paper provides a theoretical and empirical overview of the relationships among <lb/>trade, aid and FDI, both in terms of policy interactions and interactions among resource flows. <lb/>Aid flows from one country to another can have positive or negative effects on trade flows <lb/>between those countries. These effects, in turn, may act at two different levels. There are <lb/>macro-level links between aid and trade: aid enhances saving, permitting more imports, or aid <lb/>raises the real exchange rate, depressing exports. There are also micro-level mechanisms: tied aid <lb/>may increase exports if it is spent on enhancing trade capacity, but other forms of tied aid merely <lb/>lead to allocative inefficiency. Aid flows can affect trade policy in the developing country that <lb/>receives them, whether via the Dutch disease effect on the terms of trade, or via the explicit tying <lb/>of aid to the purchase of donor country goods. Aid flows also interact with donor-country trade <lb/>policy; perhaps the starkest way to frame this question is to ask whether a given developing <lb/>country is made better off by aid spending or access to the donor country&apos;s market. Economic <lb/>thinking has generally posited that a dollar of aid provides the same welfare to a poor country as <lb/>a substantially larger sum of export earnings ($2.29 according to one widely-cited study). <lb/>Nevertheless, under certain conditions that may well prevail in many countries, access to the <lb/>donor country&apos;s market may provide greater development potential; this depends in part on the <lb/>relative magnitude of negative consequences of aid inflows (via the exchange rate) and positive <lb/>dynamic effects of export specialisation. Empirical research on these issues is frustrating in its <lb/>lack of consensus, which may arise in part from difficult problems of establishing causality, <lb/>i.e., does trade affect aid, does aid affect trade, or do they mutually affect each other? <lb/>The paper next tackles the question of interrelations among trade flows and policies and <lb/>FDI flows and policies. While the theoretical literature suggests that trade and FDI may be <lb/>complements or substitutes, in practice there are compelling a priori reasons to suspect that trade <lb/>and FDI flows are complements. New trade theory models furthermore suggest that <lb/>liberalisation of trade and FDI policies in developing countries are not substitutes and that they <lb/>have complicated interactions: for example, FDI liberalisation by itself might encourage <lb/> &quot; horizontal &quot; or market-seeking FDI, while co-ordinated FDI/trade liberalisation might be more <lb/>likely to encourage &quot; vertical &quot; or cost-reducing FDI. <lb/></body>

			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>This paper provides a theoretical and empirical overview of the interactions among aid <lb/>policies, foreign direct investment (FDI) policies, trade policies and trade flows, looking at <lb/>outcomes from the point of view of the recipient or host developing country. Figure 1 <lb/>summarises and illustrates the types of links discussed. Starting with the interactions between <lb/>aid and trade, linkage may relate aid and trade flows (A1). It can also go from aid policy to trade <lb/>flow (A2). A third possibility is an aid policy intended to influence trade policy in the <lb/>recipient/host country (A3), and an inherent question of clash or coherence connects donors&apos; aid <lb/>and trade policies (A4). Interactions also appear between FDI and trade (F1, F2, and F3). Based <lb/>on these various linkages, researchers can assess the joint impact of aid, trade and FDI policies on <lb/>the welfare of the recipient/host country. <lb/>Figure 1.

This target W can be a static or dynamic long-run aggregate welfare indicator like <lb/>national real income or growth, or it can relate to the degree of heterogeneity inside the recipient <lb/>country (poverty, inequality or distributive concerns). In mathematical terms, one seeks ideally <lb/>information on the sign of the cross derivative: <lb/></body>

Policy instruments affect economic flows, in turn <lb/>generating interactions between aid or FDI flows and trade flows. These interactions then should <lb/>influence the welfare objective. Policies can also link directly when they involve conditionality or <lb/>additionality. The empirical literature has often focused more on the relationships between flows <lb/>than on those between policies, because flows are more easily measured. <lb/>Two important policy dimensions need acknowledgement. The first concerns the <lb/>definition and analytical content of trade, FDI or aid policies. In practice, each will likely be a <lb/>finely grained, multi-dimensional vector of instruments. For instance, trade policy may contain <lb/>features like tariffs and trade taxes, quantitative restrictions, rules of origin, protective <lb/>administrative procedures (antidumping, countervailing duties, customs delays), trade <lb/>restraints, or various domestic discriminatory policies (subsidies, barriers to entry, standards and <lb/>regulations). Similarly, FDI policy may involve various types of subsidy, tax exemption schemes, <lb/>factor-content arrangements and investment regulations, while aid policy typically includes an <lb/>array of bilateral and multilateral instruments including conditional and tied aid, targeted and <lb/>general funds, safety nets, etc. Most of the literature generally takes an aggregate view of these <lb/>policy vectors, but it is important to keep in mind that each will find implementation through the <lb/>interplay of its several instruments. The conclusion of this paper will return more precisely to <lb/>this issue. <lb/>Second, all of these policy areas have important political-economy dimensions. Typically, <lb/>policy implementation generates gainers and losers within and across countries, in most cases <lb/>without appropriate compensation. These distributive impacts in turn stimulate rent-seeking and <lb/>rent-sharing responses among groups or coalitions of agents. Clearly, these aspects are crucial for <lb/>understanding the internal and external political constraints within which policy coherence or <lb/>incoherence can occur. The conclusion returns briefly to this point, but most of the paper <lb/>abstracts from it and therefore neither formally models the political decision-making process nor <lb/>exhaustively reviews the related political-economy literature. <lb/></body>

			<body>II. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AID POLICY AND TRADE <lb/>II.1 Conceptual Aspects <lb/>The Relationship between Aid Flows and Trade Flows <lb/>A first approach is to consider the possible causal relationships between aid flows and <lb/>trade flows (A1 in Figure 1). Aid may affect trade because it induces general economic effects in <lb/>the recipient country, because it is directly tied to trade and/or because it reinforces bilateral <lb/>economic and political links. The first plausible impact goes through the traditional <lb/>macroeconomic view that aid supplements domestic saving, leading to increased investment that <lb/>contributes to higher growth than would be possible without aid (White, 1992). The induced <lb/>growth implies a greater capacity of the recipient country to absorb foreign products including <lb/>those originating from donors. Along this line, aid flows will likely in the medium run generate <lb/>more international trade flows for the recipient country. In a related mechanism, aid often carries <lb/>conditions for structural economic reforms in the recipient country. When the targeted reform is <lb/>trade liberalisation, the effect of aid on trade is direct, but it could also be indirect as long as <lb/>reforms stimulate growth, which in turn may increase the import capacity of the recipient <lb/>economy. Note, however, that this line of reasoning also provides good arguments for a negative <lb/>rather than positive aid/trade relationship. Aid may in fact have only a negligible <lb/>macroeconomic effect due to fungibility (Heller, 1975). Even if all aid is saved and invested, it <lb/>may simply crowd out other domestic investment by increasing the price of investment goods. A <lb/>similar result may apply if aid is tied to counterpart funds. To raise these funds, the recipient <lb/>government may have to levy distortionary taxes and/or issue public debt, which can increase <lb/>interest rates and crowd out private investment. <lb/>Aid Dependency <lb/>In the same macroeconomic tradition, the most celebrated argument of a relationship <lb/>between aid and trade flows is probably that involving the so-called &quot; Dutch disease &quot; and &quot; aid <lb/>dependency &quot; effects in the recipient economy. It illustrates the potential conflict between aid <lb/>flows and export competitiveness. The story is quite well known. Aid flows will go to finance <lb/>expenditures on non-tradable goods and services. With the price of tradable goods given, a <lb/>relative price shift in favour of non-tradable sectors (a real appreciation of the exchange rate) can <lb/>occur. The immediate effect occurs on the demand side, where more of the cheaper tradables <lb/>(especially imports) will be demanded, leading to a deterioration of the external balance that in <lb/>turn will require more aid flows (the aid dependency effect). At the same time, the real <lb/></body>

			<body>appreciation of the exchange rate leads to a resource transfer from the tradable to the non-<lb/>tradable sector, causing a significant squeeze on export producers (the Dutch disease). The <lb/>impact of aid on trade flows of the recipient country therefore occurs in two steps. First, imports <lb/>tend to increase in the short run, while in the medium run domestic export capacity tends to <lb/>decrease. If there is an inter-temporal effect (like a learning externality effect of exports on <lb/>domestic productivity), the Dutch disease may have long-run negative implications for the trade <lb/>flows of the recipient country. If the country has idle capacity, however, the income effect of aid <lb/>might not translate into real appreciation as both the tradable and non-tradable sectors might <lb/>grow. Moreover, a developing country might even benefit from a real appreciation because of <lb/>low substitutability between domestic production and imported inputs (Nkusu, 2004). Yet if idle <lb/>capacity originates from rigidity on the production side, such as price or wage indexation, it is <lb/>not obvious that the tradable sector would gain in all cases from an aid transfer. <lb/>Aid Tying <lb/>Formal tying of aid to the recipient&apos;s purchase of goods from the donor provides the most <lb/>direct and obvious link between aid and trade. Because such aid generally takes the form of <lb/>goods procured by the donor, aid is itself trade in the form of donor exports. Tied aid may also <lb/>induce dynamic effects by increasing recipient exposure to donor export goods, which in turn <lb/>may encourage follow-up orders and expand future donor exports. Such aid is an instrument of <lb/>trade policy (Morrissey, 1991). Tying can also be informal, the result of political goodwill such <lb/>that the recipient may feel more inclined, if not obliged, to buy the donor&apos;s goods. Again, tying <lb/>may generate important allocative inefficiencies inside the recipient economy. Jepma (1991), <lb/>notes that exports under tied aid often exceed prevailing world prices by between 10 per cent <lb/>and 40 per cent. Capital-goods imports priced so highly may retard growth and therefore the <lb/>subsequent capacity of the country to trade with the rest of the world. Tied aid thus may have <lb/>differential temporal impacts on trade flows, increasing them in the short run and reducing them <lb/>in the long run. <lb/>Aid-induced trade dependency can also occur. Even when aid is not tied, for example, it <lb/>may fund projects requiring imports of capital goods produced only in the source country. Food <lb/>aid, it has been argued, tends by reducing local prices to distort the allocation of resources in <lb/>recipient countries away from local food production. Over time, this can exacerbate and prolong <lb/>the very shortages that the aid is intended to solve, with the outcome of prolonged dependence <lb/>on trade flows from donor countries. <lb/>Reverse Causality <lb/>As several authors have recognised (see the survey in Lloyd et al., 1998), the causality <lb/>between aid and trade flows obviously can also go the other way around. This paper focuses on <lb/>the causality link from aid to trade, but it is useful to remember the main arguments for reverse <lb/>causality. Trade can affect aid allocation in different ways. Lobby and business groups, which <lb/>may have particular trade interests, can influence aid allocation in donor countries, or donors can <lb/>simply give aid-allocation preferences to countries with which they have the strongest <lb/></body>

			<body>commercial ties. A donor might want to reward a recipient for the purchase of its export goods, <lb/>or it might want to consolidate or expand its markets where the expectations of aid-induced <lb/>trade dependency are highest. Conversely, the causal relationship can reverse if the donor uses <lb/>aid to promote export ties in countries with which it has weaker commercial links. <lb/>How Do Aid Flows Interact with Trade Policy in the Recipient Country? <lb/>Given the plausible channels of interaction between aid and trade flows, what about the <lb/>direct interactions between policy instruments? The route from aid instruments to aid flows <lb/>seems quite direct and needs little discussion. The interplay between aid flows/policies and trade <lb/>policies of the recipient or donor country (A3, A4 in Figure 1) is more complex. This subsection <lb/>reviews what theory has to say about foreign aid and trade policies in recipient countries and <lb/>their consequences for the recipients&apos; welfare as measured by aggregate national real income. <lb/>The next subsection investigates the links between aid and donor trade policies. <lb/>The Transfer Paradox <lb/>The conceptual background stems from the theory of income transfers in international <lb/>trade theory. How a transfer of real resources from one country to another affects both the source <lb/>and recipient countries has now become part of a well-established tradition in international <lb/>economics, well known since the Keynes-Ohlin controversy on German reparation payments <lb/>after World War I and Samuelson&apos;s clarification (1952). Beyond its direct income effect, an <lb/>international transfer will likely have important terms-of-trade effects on both the donor and the <lb/>recipient, the sign of which depends on the relative size of the marginal propensities to consume <lb/>in the two economies. The so-called &quot; orthodox &quot; view holds that the donor&apos;s terms of trade <lb/>should deteriorate because each country should have a larger domestic marginal propensity to <lb/>consume its exportable good (Keynes, 1929). Subsequent, significant work has considered the <lb/> &quot; anti-orthodox &quot; view that an income transfer improves the donor&apos;s terms of trade (see Jones, <lb/>1970; Chipman, 1974; Jones, 1975; and Li and Mayer, 1990). <lb/>A major issue involves how income transfers affect the welfare levels of the donor and <lb/>recipient countries. The literature has given considerable attention to the conditions under which <lb/>an international transfer is immiserising for the recipient country (the &quot; transfer paradox &quot; ). As is <lb/>well known from Leontief (1936), Samuelson (1947) and Mundell (1960), in a two-country world <lb/>with free trade and no distortions, immiserising transfers from abroad cannot arise when <lb/>markets are stable <lb/>1 <lb/>. In the interactions between aid instruments and trade policies, however, <lb/>transfers that worsen welfare in the recipient country become possible when one departs from <lb/>the distortion-free world 2 . First, consider a multilateral world economy and enlarge the set of <lb/>countries to more than the two economies participating in the transfer. Several contributions <lb/>have shown the possibility of perverse transfer outcomes in a three countries/agents context <lb/>(Gale, 1974; Chichilnsiky, 1980; Brecher and Bhagwati, 1981; and Yano, 1983). Bhagwati et al. <lb/>1. <lb/>Stability means that in global markets an excess demand for a particular good leads to an increase in the price of <lb/>this good in order to restore the initial competitive equilibrium. <lb/>2. <lb/>For more details, see the survey in Brakmann and Marrewijk (1998). <lb/></body>

			<body>(1983), however, demonstrate in their integrating analysis with a theory of distortions and <lb/>welfare that the transfer paradox cannot arise in a three-agent framework if the recipient and the <lb/>donor countries uniformly impose an optimal tariff policy jointly against the non participant <lb/>country. This result suggests a certain degree of complementarity between foreign aid and <lb/>regional trade policies crafted to avoid perverse welfare outcomes in a recipient economy. <lb/>Second, the transfer may take place in the presence of exogenous domestic distortions, of <lb/>which trade policies in the recipient or the donor countries represent an important case. As <lb/>Ohyama (1974), Brecher and Bhagwati (1982) and more generally Bhagwati et al. (1985) show, <lb/>exogenous price distortions such as tax and/or subsidy policies, can lead to the transfer paradox <lb/>and a recipient-country loss from the aid transfer. This is quite easy to grasp intuitively in the <lb/>case of a recipient&apos;s tariff policy, for example. Recall that an immiserising transfer occurs <lb/>basically because, after the transfer, the recipient faces deterioration in its terms of trade. This <lb/>leads to increased production and reduced consumption of the recipient&apos;s importable. Under <lb/>domestic tariff protection, however, this commodity already is &quot; over produced &quot; and &quot; under <lb/>consumed &quot; . The change in relative international prices therefore exacerbates this existing <lb/>situation, and the extra cost may suffice to ensure a welfare decline in the aid-receiving country 3 . <lb/>When this occurs, the preceding discussion suggests that trade liberalisation by the recipient can <lb/>act as a complement to the foreign aid instrument. Indeed, a reduction of the recipient&apos;s tariff <lb/>must accompany the transfer from abroad in order to minimise the possibility of a transfer <lb/>paradox in the recipient country 4 . <lb/>Probably the most interesting situation arises when the transfer itself creates domestic <lb/>distortions. Aid tying is of course the classical example. Ohyama (1974), Brecher and Bhagwati <lb/>(1982), Kemp and Kojima (1985), Schweinberger (1990) and Tajoli (1999) all are welfare analyses <lb/>of the general phenomenon. For instance, Brecher and Bhagwati (1982) consider a small open <lb/>economy where aid is accompanied by &quot; production additionality requirements &quot; — e.g. food aid <lb/>whose donor may require more domestic food production as a condition for the aid. In such a <lb/>case, production shifts away from its efficient allocation, and the recipient may end up poorer <lb/>after the transfer. When the donor demands that local imports be increased by the amount of the <lb/>aid provided, however, the use of an appropriate import policy to match this requirement <lb/>prevents immiserisation. Kemp and Kojima (1985) consider a situation where the tying takes the <lb/>form of an expenditure pattern forced on the recipient government, i.e. to spend a certain <lb/>fraction of the transfer on the importable good. In such a case, if the government&apos;s marginal <lb/>propensity to spend associated with the tying is larger than that of private agents, the <lb/>3. <lb/>An important necessary condition for the transfer paradox to occur in such a context requires the recipient&apos;s <lb/>importable to behave like an inferior good in donor-country consumption. This may initially appear rather <lb/>pathological, but two remarks can make the case empirically plausible. First, some products (like some foods) may <lb/>well be inferior for individual consumers, implying that inferiority at the national level cannot be automatically <lb/>dismissed. Second, even when each good is normal at the individual level, national consumption may well exhibit <lb/>inferiority when there is a certain pattern of individual heterogeneity. <lb/>4. <lb/>More specifically, the recipient cannot be impoverished if the tariff rate is adjusted to hold imports or exports to <lb/>their pre-aid level (Ohyama, 1974). <lb/></body>

			<body>deterioration of the terms of trade may be strong enough to induce a transfer paradox. This can <lb/>occur without existence of inferiority in national consumption patterns 5 . <lb/>Lahiri and Raimondos-Moller (1995) emphasise the importance of the form of trade policy <lb/>in its interaction with foreign aid. They consider the effect of aid when the recipient country <lb/>imposes a quantitative restriction on the importable good. A first result reveals that an increase <lb/>in untied aid unambiguously benefits the recipient country. Contrasting results emerge under <lb/>tariff or price distortions and with quantitative restrictions, where a transfer has no effect on the <lb/>wastage caused by the pre-existing distortions. Under a tariff restriction, a deterioration of the <lb/>terms of trade can reduce domestic imports, which already are too small compared with the <lb/>first-best level, therefore increasing further the wastage from the pre-existing tariff distortion. <lb/>This introduces the possibility of a transfer paradox. With a quantitative restriction, however, as <lb/>long as the restriction remains binding after the transfer, imports will not change and <lb/>consequently the transfer will generate no additional wastage. Because, in a stable two-country <lb/>world economy, the terms of trade effect can never by itself overcome the direct income effect of <lb/>a transfer, no possibility of an immiserising untied transfer can arise when the recipient country <lb/>uses quantitative restrictions. <lb/>Lahiri and Raimondos-Moller (1995) also consider tied aid that requires the recipient <lb/>country to increase imports of the commodity subject to quantitative restrictions. Such a transfer <lb/>reduces a pre-existing distortion, and one can see immediately that it improves world welfare. <lb/>Moreover, when the quantitative restriction is an import quota at less than the optimum level, <lb/>aid tied to more imports clearly also makes the recipient better off. More generally, a condition to <lb/>prevent immiserisation of the recipient country in such a situation is that the price elasticity of <lb/>the donor&apos;s export supply function must be high enough. Yet in such a case the rise in the price <lb/>of the recipient&apos;s importable necessary for the donor to be able to supply the additional demand <lb/>because of the tied transfer is relatively small. The secondary effects of the transfer via changes in <lb/>the terms of trade will be limited, and this ensures that the recipient benefits. <lb/>In many cases, donors earmark foreign aid to finance public consumption and public <lb/>inputs in recipient countries. This kind of aid tying can also generate endogenous distortions. <lb/>Again, changes in the terms of trade between donor and recipient open the possibility of an effect <lb/>on trade flows and the transfer paradox (Hatzipanayotou and Michael, 1995) 6 . Schweinberger <lb/>(2002) considers the effect of foreign aid in an economy with a public good whose labour costs <lb/>are financed by a tariff levied on a private importable good. Two interrelated distortions are <lb/>present in such an economy. First, the public good is under-supplied because of lack of <lb/>5. <lb/>Schweinberger (1990) considers an alternative tying rule, which constrains the spending of the income by the <lb/>private sector of the economy. This type of rationing creates a wedge between domestic and foreign consumer <lb/>prices and thus opens again the possibility of a transfer paradox. It also requires, however, that the domestic <lb/>consumer price in the recipient country be lower than the consumer price in the donor country, a situation that is <lb/>clearly unsustainable under free trade. <lb/>6. <lb/>More precisely, Hatzipanayotou and Michael (1995) show that when the imported and public goods are net <lb/>complements, and the consumer&apos;s marginal willingness to pay for the public good is larger than its unit cost of <lb/>production (which may be expected to hold in countries with few public goods), then a small aid transfer can <lb/>reduce the welfare of the recipient country. <lb/></body>

			<body>information or for political-economy reasons. Second, the trade policy distortion is implemented <lb/>on budgetary grounds. Tied aid in the form of an increase in the stock of the specific capital used <lb/>in producing the public good then will likely raise recipient welfare because it reduces the twin <lb/>distortions. It increases the production of the public good. If consumption of the importable is <lb/>complementary to consumption of the public good, then the transfer may in turn stimulate <lb/>imports, hence relaxing the initial tariff distortion and financing more production of the public <lb/>good. <lb/>Given the importance of the terms-of-trade effects induced by foreign aid, most of the <lb/>transfer literature has focused essentially on the two-country case. Yet some attention has also <lb/>gone to the impact of tied aid in a small open economy where the terms of trade remain fixed by <lb/>definition. In the seminal contribution, Johnson (1967a) showed that an exogenous increase in the <lb/>stock of a domestic resource (e.g. aid tied to this resource) may bring a welfare loss in a small, <lb/>tariff-ridden, open economy if it exacerbates overproduction in the protected import-competing <lb/>industry. Yano and Nugent (1999) extended this analysis, emphasising the importance of <lb/> &quot; non traded goods &quot; effects, meaning an expansion of the non-traded sector caused by foreign <lb/>aid. They again underline the possibility of immiserising transfer if non-traded goods are net <lb/>substitutes for protected importable goods. In such a case, the decline in the relative price of the <lb/>non-traded good resulting from the aid-induced expansion of the non-traded sector tends to <lb/>reduce the &quot; already too low &quot; imports of the recipient economy, leading to increased economic <lb/>distortions. They present empirical evidence suggesting that their non-traded-good effect <lb/>appears as more important than the standard Johnson effect in generating the possibility of <lb/>welfare-worsening impacts of foreign aid on small, open economies. Schweinberger (2002) <lb/>extends their analysis by showing how different assumptions about the mobility or immobility of <lb/>factors across industries affect the sign and magnitude of both effects. This channel for <lb/>potentially harmful effects of tied aid on trade flows and welfare contrasts with the usual &quot; Dutch <lb/>disease &quot; effect and real appreciation of the exchange rate generally mentioned in the macro <lb/>literature. <lb/>Aid versus Trade: Aid Flows Interacting with the Donor&apos;s Trade Policy <lb/>This sub-section considers the frequently debated issue of &quot; Aid versus Trade &quot; . What is the <lb/>better way to help a recipient country — foreign assistance or export access to the donor&apos;s <lb/>markets? Formally, one needs to compare the worth to the recipient of exports to the donor&apos;s <lb/>market with that of an equal amount of foreign assistance. Johnson (1967b) again produced the <lb/>first, seminal attempt along those lines. Thirwall (1976) and Yassin (1982) extended his analysis. <lb/>The treatment here follows Mosley (1985). To compare trade with aid, three types of economic <lb/>effects have relevance. First, the direct economic effects involve how a dollar of aid compares <lb/>with a dollar of foreign exchange earned by exporting. Second, indirect effects on the recipient&apos;s <lb/>economy can occur, in particular on the public sector, the supply of savings and domestic prices <lb/>affecting the private sector. Third, more general political-economy considerations relate to the <lb/>intrinsic worth of &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<body>Direct Effects <lb/>If aid is offered as a pure gift with no tying, it places additional resources for investment <lb/>directly in the hands of the recipient government. It thus saves the recipient country the excess <lb/>cost of import substitution, i.e. the cost of making at home the goods that aid makes it possible to <lb/>import. Following Johnson (1967b), the value of an amount of aid A is therefore equal to (1+c)A, <lb/>where c is the excess cost of import substitution. Exports do not provide additional resources for <lb/>investment directly. They do so only indirectly to the extent that they offer the possibility of <lb/>transforming domestic resources into goods more cheaply than domestic production of <lb/>importable goods, saving the excess cost of import substitution. The value of an amount X of <lb/>exports to the economy is therefore cX, and the relative worth of exports compared to pure aid <lb/>can be expressed as the cX/(1+c)A. From this, it follows that the value of exports can never exceed <lb/>the value of an equal amount of pure aid. At the margin, foreign aid is always worth more than <lb/>trade (Johnson 1967b). <lb/>Aid is rarely pure, however. It very often has a tied component related to the purchase of <lb/>goods in the donor economy or to some other potentially distortive policy action by the recipient <lb/>government, as the foregoing analysis shows. In that case, if r is the ratio of the price of goods <lb/>supplied by aid to the best competitive price obtainable on free markets, the relative worth of <lb/>exports becomes: [cX/(1+c)A] .r. In that case, the value of exports can exceed the value of aid <lb/>when cr &gt; 1+c which will hold only for relatively high values of c and r, that is, for countries &quot; far <lb/>enough &quot; from world markets (costly imports) and receiving relatively efficient aid (small degree <lb/>of tying). Moreover, much aid is not given on pure grant terms but as soft loans with below-<lb/>market interest rates. If F is the nominal amount of foreign assistance and g is the aid component <lb/>of assistance, the relative worth of exports becomes [cX/(1+c)Fg].r, and the condition for trade to <lb/>dominate aid becomes cr &gt; c(1+g). As Thirwall (1976) and Mosley (1985) argue, it remains the case <lb/>that c and r would have to be quite high and g relatively low to make such an inequality true. For <lb/>instance, for an excess import-substitution cost of 50 per cent (c = ½) and with no aid tying (r = 1), <lb/>trade would dominate aid only if the ratio of aid to assistance falls below 0.3, suggesting as <lb/>Thirwall (1976) says that aid is very likely to dominate export market access as an effective <lb/>policy. <lb/>Indirect Effects <lb/>Export revenues and aid income also of course have indirect economic effects on the <lb/>recipient country. They may influence the propensity to save and thereby the growth rate. They <lb/>may also affect relative prices, in particular the real exchange rate, as with the Dutch disease. <lb/>They may affect public-spending patterns as well. Clearly, if these effects differ for export <lb/>revenues and aid income, then they will certainly affect the relative worth of trade compared to <lb/>aid. They also take time to emerge, over a number of periods T. In that case, the new formula <lb/>becomes: <lb/></body>

While estimates of these side effects are quite primitive, <lb/>this simple example indicates that it is no longer obvious that aid dominates trade for all possible <lb/>parameter configurations. <lb/>The last effect to take into account reflects general political-economy considerations of the <lb/>relative merits of trade versus aid for the recipient country. If, for self-sufficiency reasons, the <lb/>recipient economy attaches an intrinsic weight w&gt;1 to the value of a dollar earned by exporting in <lb/>relation to the value of a dollar received as overseas aid, then the formula needs amendment to <lb/>reflect that concern, and the value of aid obviously diminishes relative to trade. <lb/>Aid or Market Access? <lb/>The previous approach is useful to derive a simple, rule-based comparison of the relative <lb/>worth of export revenues and foreign assistance for a recipient country, but from a policy point <lb/>of view it fails to place the discussion in a full cost-benefit context from the perspective of the <lb/>donor country. Kemp and Shimomura (1991) discuss this in a fully specified two-country, <lb/>two-goods general-equilibrium trade context. Formally, they consider the following problem. <lb/>Given a situation in which both countries impose effective but sub-optimal taxes on trade, which <lb/>instrument should the home country use to secure a given increase in welfare of the foreign <lb/>country — a lump sum transfer or an adjustment of its border tax? While a precise answer <lb/>depends on the initial pattern of trade taxes implemented by the two countries, Kemp and <lb/>Shimomura show that in general it is optimal for the home country to adjust both instruments at <lb/>the same time, suggesting a degree of complementarity between aid and trade policies. <lb/></note>

			<body>Adam and O&apos;Connell (2004) have also challenged the general Johnson presumption that <lb/>aid is unambiguously better than trade to assist a recipient country. Taking an explicitly dynamic <lb/>perspective and emphasising the role of learning-by-doing externalities, they show that the <lb/>balance in such a context shifts decisively in favour of market access rather than aid. Their <lb/>starting point is the observation that, other things equal, aid reduces export competitiveness in <lb/>the recipient country by an appreciation of the real exchange rate in a variant of the classical <lb/>Dutch disease (Van Wijnbergen, 1985). Hence a dollar of donor resources transferred via the <lb/>donor&apos;s own import liberalisation is better for the recipient&apos;s exports than a dollar transferred <lb/></body>

			<body>through grants. When externalities to exporting not internalised by an export subsidy exist, a <lb/>shift from aid to trade by increasing the recipient&apos;s export-sector productivity may actually make <lb/>both parties better off. The authors then extend their basic theoretical setting to a more fully <lb/>articulated dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of a stylised African economy <lb/>and examine the effects of a shift at the margin from aid to tariff preferences. They calibrate the <lb/>externality spillover parameter such that the optimal subsidy fully internalising the spillover <lb/>effect corresponds to the average duty of 11.5 per cent imposed on developing countries by the <lb/>United States between 1980-85. For such values of the dynamic externality, they show that <lb/> &quot; trade &quot; is superior to &quot; aid &quot; in terms of welfare for both economies. Allowing for capital <lb/>accumulation in the model magnifies the relative knowledge externality effect. On the other <lb/>hand, when the recipient country can finance infrastructure and public capital accumulation only <lb/>through distortionary taxation, &quot; aid &quot; regains some interest because of its direct effect on the <lb/>public budget. <lb/> &quot; Aid for Trade &quot; : The Complementarity between Aid and Trade Liberalisation <lb/>Despite much policy discussion on the importance of aid flows as a way to facilitate trade <lb/>(the so-called trade facilitation issues) and market access, little analytical work has dealt formally <lb/>with the subject. One exception, Lahiri et al. (2002), uses a standard two-country, two-goods trade <lb/>model in which countries can decide strategically their optimal trade policies. (This is the usual <lb/>tariff-war argument, which can be generalised to more sensible political-economy arguments). <lb/>Additionally, one country can make an international transfer (foreign aid) to the other, which is <lb/>free to accept or refuse that aid. Given that aid is given and received only if it increases welfare in <lb/>both countries, there can be no transfer paradox. Therefore, without altruism, the only value of <lb/>aid for the donor comes from the strategic spillover effects it has on the choice of trade <lb/>instruments between the two countries. <lb/>A result of the analysis is that when its level is decided before that of tariffs, foreign aid <lb/>may induce in the recipient country a more open trade policy and therefore give the donor an <lb/>incentive to give aid in the first place. The insight relates to standard ideas on optimal tax <lb/>policies. The recipient designs its optimal trade policy such that its marginal cost in terms of <lb/>dead-weight loss on domestic production and consumption is equal to its marginal benefit, <lb/>which produces a shift in the terms of trade to its advantage. It is well known that a transfer may <lb/>under certain circumstances induce a terms-of-trade effect in favour of the recipient country. In <lb/>such situations, because the terms of trade have already moved in the right direction, the <lb/>marginal benefit to the recipient country of using trade policies to affect its terms of trade <lb/>additionally is reduced. It chooses a more open trade policy at any level of the trade policy of the <lb/>other (donor) economy. In other words, transfers do in part the work that optimal trade taxes do; <lb/>they affect world prices and are in some respects a substitute for them. As a result, foreign aid <lb/>may shift downward the tariff reaction function of the recipient economy, providing a strategic <lb/>value for the donor economy. Whether trade flows increase between the two economies then <lb/>depends on the optimal response of the donor country to less protectionism in the recipient <lb/>country. In such a setting aid tied to reduced protection in the recipient country may be <lb/>Pareto-improving for both economies, as it can be viewed as a commitment device towards trade <lb/></body>

			<body>liberalisation. &quot; Aid for trade &quot; , in such a case, implements a better world economic resource <lb/>allocation in a way which is both credible and politically feasible. <lb/>II.2 Empirical Aspects of the Interaction between Aid and Trade <lb/>From Aid Flows to Trade Flows <lb/>A growing literature investigates empirically the link between aid and trade flows (A1 in <lb/>Figure 1). Most of the papers study the determinants of aid allocation, i.e. causality going from <lb/>trade to aid 7 . A few look at the reverse effect from aid to trade (Morrissey, 1993). One motivation <lb/>for these papers is to assess the efficiency of tied aid, the use of which the donor determines, <lb/>generally in the form of increased imports of services or goods from the donor. A special case is <lb/>mixed credits (a mix of commercial export credit, concessional loans and pure grants). Food aid <lb/>is also a type of tied aid (see below). Other intermediary types include aid loans, soft loans, <lb/>partial grants and concessional export credits. All in all, 48 per cent of bilateral EU aid is tied on <lb/>average. <lb/>Some papers use the gravity model, with bilateral exports as a dependent variable and <lb/>bilateral aid as an explanatory variable (see Nilsson, 1997, for EU countries and Wagner, 2003 for <lb/>a larger sample of 20 donors and 109 recipients). Wagner estimates an equation that takes into <lb/>account the possibility that the amount of aid is zero for some (donor, recipient) pairs, on a <lb/>repeated cross-section for five years during 1970-90: <lb/>where Xdr represents exports from the donor d to the recipient r, Adr is the amount of aid given <lb/>by d to r, Γdr is a linear function of the usual variables in a gravity model such as the GDP of <lb/>donor and recipient, distance and dummies for a common language, remoteness of the donor <lb/>and remoteness of the recipient. Wagner controls for unmeasurable common factors by <lb/>introducing in the gravity equation the residual of a preliminary regression on imports from the <lb/>recipient to the donor. He finds an elasticity of 0.163: increasing aid to a country by 10 per cent <lb/>increases donor exports to it by 1.63 per cent. This elasticity translates into an average of <lb/>1.85 cents of exports generated per additional dollar of aid. The effect is mostly <lb/>contemporaneous. Nilsson, on a sample restricted to EU countries during 1975-92, finds that $1 <lb/>of aid generates $2.6 of exports from donor to recipient. The average estimate hides huge <lb/>discrepancies, ranging from $0.67 for Denmark to $3.85 for France. All in all, the impact on <lb/>7. <lb/>These determinants respond either to recipient needs (humanitarian motives) or to donors&apos; interests (McKinley and <lb/>Little, 1979). The donor might be willing to extend its political influence (aid could, for instance, incite the recipient <lb/>country to join the donor&apos;s positions in UN voting), comfort a military ally or increase its export market share. <lb/>Dudley and Montmarquette (1976) build a structural model where aid enters in the utility function of the donor <lb/>country and test it in a cross section of developing countries for 1970 considering one donor at a time (hence, a <lb/>small number of observations). Most papers deal with reduced-form estimations, however. A good example with <lb/>multiple donors, recipients and years (1980-99) is Berthélemy and Tichit (2002). They find that aid will go to <lb/>countries attracting FDI from the world generally and linked to the donor by strong bilateral trade. <lb/>{ } <lb/>[ <lb/>] <lb/>ln <lb/>ln <lb/>0.163 ln (max 1, <lb/>) 1.75 <lb/>0 <lb/>dr <lb/>dr <lb/>dr <lb/>dr <lb/>dr <lb/>X <lb/>A <lb/>A <lb/>ε <lb/>= Γ + <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/></body>

			<body>exports is greater, the larger the donor country. The effect of aid on exports arises mostly from <lb/>bilateral aid as opposed to multilateral aid, for which the coefficient on exports is negative and <lb/>significant for Denmark, Italy and France. <lb/>Aid and Trade: What Is the Causality? <lb/>The causality between aid flows and trade flows clearly can go both ways, and assessing <lb/>its main direction is important. Lloyd et al. (2000) and Arvin et al. (2000) use Granger causality <lb/>tests. They find that the direction of causality depends on the pairing of donor and recipient <lb/>countries. In a sample of aid commitments between four EU donors and 26 African recipients <lb/>over 1969-95, Lloyd et al. find that trade determines aid for only 15 of 87 pairs (17 per cent), aid <lb/>determines trade for 13 per cent and the causality runs both ways for 7 per cent. It is hard to get a <lb/>clear picture of the link between aid and trade, even for a given donor. France could be the only <lb/>exception, where for a larger share of recipients (seven of 20, or 35 per cent) the causality runs <lb/>from aid to trade. <lb/>As a consequence of this time-series heterogeneity, one should examine the aid/trade <lb/>relationship on data pre-tested to identify sub-panels according to the direction of causality and <lb/>not, as is usually the case, on pooled panel data. When the causality goes from aid to trade, Lloyd <lb/>et al. (2001) find that the effect is first negative and becomes positive after two years. For changes <lb/>in a recipient&apos;s shares of aid and imports respectively from a donor, an increase in the share of <lb/>aid seems indeed to have a positive effect on the share of imports. The negative effect of aid-flow <lb/>on trade-flow levels is completely ignored if the estimation is performed on the whole sample, <lb/>regardless of preliminary Granger causality tests. This means that a positive impact of aid on <lb/>trade is a spurious result that appears if the estimation coefficients are constrained to be the same <lb/>for all pairs of countries. When the causality goes from trade to aid, the effect of a change in the <lb/>trade level on aid is not significantly different from zero with control for other variables. In <lb/>contrast, a change in the import share does seem to have a positive impact on the share of aid. <lb/>Donors give more aid to recipients that buy proportionately more imports from them, reflecting <lb/>the strategic motive in aid allocation. This last result is also found on the total sample, suggesting <lb/>that it is a robust finding <lb/>Food Aid 8 <lb/>Food aid has received special attention in the empirical literature. It is defined as an <lb/>international sourcing of concessional resources in the form of or for the provision of food (Barett <lb/>and Maxwell, forthcoming). It comes in various types: programme aid, emergency aid or project <lb/>aid, such as food for work or supplementary feeding programmes for children and pregnant <lb/>women. It has been much criticised. It is a second-best instrument and quite expensive, even <lb/>compared with other forms of aid, because of high agricultural prices on EU and US markets. <lb/>Moreover, a rising share of processed goods in food aid favours agri-business and monopolistic <lb/>competition in food shipping. The most important distinction with respect to trade is between <lb/>8. <lb/>This section draws on Barett and Maxwell (forthcoming), chap. 4. <lb/></body>

			<body>food aid in kind or through money transfers. The first type can be either distributed directly or <lb/>monetised and sold on local markets. The second entails buying food either on local markets or <lb/>in third countries (triangular purchase). <lb/>The FAO ensures that food aid respects the Usual Marketing Requirements (UMR), which <lb/>are commitments to maintain normal levels of commercial food imports. The philosophy behind <lb/>the UMR is that food aid must be aid that would not otherwise be forthcoming in cash and food <lb/>that would not otherwise be purchased (Maxwell and Singer, 1979) 9 . The UMR are based on the <lb/>assumption that the marginal propensity to consume out of in-kind aid is higher than that for <lb/>money transfers. Empirical evidence suggests that this is not the case and that food aid adds to <lb/>food consumption at roughly the same rate as cash transfers, the order of magnitude being from <lb/>30 per cent to 60 per cent of the food aid shipped. This has to do with Engle curve and income <lb/>effects (the rise in income does not translate entirely into demand for food). Yet it might change <lb/>over time, and thus the impact of food aid on trade needs study in a dynamic perspective. Barett <lb/>et al. (1999) do this using a vector auto-regression approach fitted on US cereal-programme food <lb/>aid sent to 18 developing countries between 1961-95. They find that in the short run commercial <lb/>imports of the recipient country indeed decrease (-30 per cent of food aid), but in the long run a <lb/>J-curve appears, and commercial imports resume after five years. This rise in imports benefits <lb/>third countries more than the donor country. A possible explanation for this long-term rise <lb/>comes from induced shifts in consumer tastes, income effects and transaction costs reduced by <lb/>the development of distribution channels 10 . Yet there are considerable differences in the <lb/>magnitudes of aid, production and trade. The mean aid volume in the sample is only 9 per cent <lb/>of mean production and 17 per cent of commercial imports. Therefore, even if the conditional <lb/>expectation of food aid&apos;s effect on commercial imports does follow a J-curve, one cannot say that <lb/>food aid drives recipient-country trade patterns. <lb/>From the viewpoint of a developing country, if food aid could substitute for commercial <lb/>imports it would in fact ease the balance of payments constraint and free resources for imports — <lb/>of investment goods, for example. It would then equate with untied financial aid, which might be <lb/>a more efficient instrument. &quot; There is a certain inconsistency in proposals which talk about food <lb/>aid as providing balance-of-payments support while insisting that developing countries cannot <lb/>be helped to pay for the food imports they are forced to make commercially. &quot; (Maxwell and <lb/>Singer, 1979). Analysts of this issue need a clearer picture of recipient countries&apos; food trade with <lb/>donors as well as third countries. A first step in this direction is an OECD study (2004), which <lb/>suggests that the effect of aid depends on the modalities of delivery (grant or loan, programme, <lb/>9. <lb/>In practice, the UMR sets a limit to food aid, namely average recipient-country imports of the commodity over the <lb/>preceding five years. The UMR is waived for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and for emergency aid. <lb/>10. Food aid, according to Barett and Maxwell, is akin to &quot; a free-sample marketing campaign &quot; . They cite anecdotal <lb/>evidence of the United States encouraging the shift from rice to wheat or from soft wheat to hard wheat in which <lb/>North America has a comparative advantage. Genetically modified (GM) food aid provides another example. In <lb/>2002, Mozambique and Zimbabwe accepted potentially GM food aid from the United States under certain <lb/>conditions (food must be milled before shipping), but Zambia turned it down because it feared denial of market <lb/>access for its own products in Europe. <lb/></body>

			<body>project or emergency, bilateral or multilateral) and on the product types (cereals, pulses or oils <lb/>and fats) 11 . <lb/>To summarise, the literature on aid and trade flows suggests that most the impact of aid <lb/>on trade and even the direction of the causality are driven by factors related to specific <lb/>donor/recipient pairs. This justifies the use of case studies, which would scrutinise the <lb/>non-economic factors (institutions or historical ties) that could explain the specificity of the <lb/>relationships and its likely impact on trade via aid. The general empirical studies also highlight <lb/>the importance of the sectoral structures of recipient countries, distinguishing between tradables <lb/>(both exportable and import-competing goods) and non-tradables, the evolution of their relative <lb/>prices and the extent of factor mobility between the two sectors. A recipient&apos;s overall macro <lb/>environment matters too; the transfer paradox illustrates how aid can interfere with balance-of-<lb/>payments and fiscal constraints. Important features of aid in that respect concern whether it is <lb/>spent on traded or non-traded goods (say, health or education expenditures), and how it is <lb/>distributed domestically among various groups of the population. From a practical point of view, <lb/>because of the differences in magnitude between aid and trade in many countries, the <lb/>significance of the impact of aid on trade will likely depend on the types of calculation — <lb/>marginal vs. mean effects, in levels or in shares. <lb/>Aid for Trade: Trade Facilitation and Tariff Compensation Schemes <lb/>Trade facilitation is aid meant to alleviate the cost of suppressing barriers to trade. The <lb/>first type of such aid involves compensating schemes or monetary transfers proportional to the <lb/>losses incurred by recipient countries during trade liberalisation. This aid resembles structural <lb/>adjustment loans, which are often conditioned on indicators of trade liberalisation, but they take <lb/>place during economic crises and their conditionality extends beyond trade policies to macro <lb/>stabilisation, budgetary issues and financial-system reforms. Some regional trade agreements <lb/>include compensating transfers, e.g. the EU&apos;s structural funds 12 . In another example, the EU put <lb/>in place the MEDA funds directed to Mediterranean countries that joined a common Free Trade <lb/>Area (the Barcelona Partnership). Mediterranean countries were expected to face sharp losses in <lb/>tariff revenues following the suppression of their duties on European industrial imports. These <lb/>losses could be significant for some countries like Tunisia, which sources 70 per cent of its <lb/>imports in the EU and where tariff duties represent over 20 per cent of total fiscal revenue. <lb/>MEDA commitments for the Mediterranean countries in 1995-01 amounted to 1 805 million <lb/>euros. Of this, 59 per cent went to alleviate the macroeconomic and social costs of trade <lb/>liberalisation (balance of payments and social safety-net support), and 40 per cent was allocated <lb/>to private-sector development (vocational training, business centres and guarantees for loans by <lb/>small and medium enterprises). <lb/>11. The methodology used in OECD (2004) has flaws. Commercial net imports, domestic production and consumption <lb/>of the recipient country are estimated separately, taking into account neither the simultaneity of the three <lb/>equations&apos; variables nor the possible endogeneity of aid. <lb/>12. The evaluation of the impact of structural funds on the convergence of members of a regional agreement is beyond <lb/>the scope of this paper, which focuses on trade-related technical assistance. <lb/></body>

			<body>Trade facilitation activities cover two main categories 13 : <lb/>• Trade policy and regulations: support to aid recipients&apos; effective participation in<lb/>multilateral trade negotiations, analysis and implementation of multilateral trade <lb/>agreements, trade policy mainstreaming and technical standards, trade facilitation <lb/>including tariff structures and customs regimes, support to regional agreements <lb/>and human resources development in trade; and <lb/>• Trade development: business development, access to trade finance, trade<lb/>promotion in some sectors. <lb/>Until the creation of the WTO, GATT technical assistance largely took the form of <lb/>trade-policy courses. Bilateral co-operation provided the channel for most trade-related <lb/>assistance. In 1996 the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-<lb/>Developed Countries (IF) was launched. The IF brings together six-international agencies 14 to <lb/>collaborate with bilateral donors to ensure greater coherence in the provision of trade-related <lb/>technical assistance. The core of the IF is the provision of diagnosis reports, which include action <lb/>matrices stating with priority rankings the various tasks offered to external funding. An action <lb/>matrix is established at least theoretically after discussion with local stakeholders co-ordinated <lb/>by a Focal Point (usually in the Ministry of Trade). Another initiative is the Joint Integrated <lb/>Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP), launched by the WTO, UNCTAD and the ITC in <lb/>selected Least-Developed and other African countries 15 . In 2001, the Doha Development Agenda <lb/>Global Trust Fund was launched, and the IF and JITAP were revamped and expanded in 2003. <lb/>Bilateral and multilateral trade-assistance commitments increased to a total of almost $2.8 billion <lb/>in 2003 (see WTO/OECD, 2004, for details on the distribution of these activities by donor, <lb/>recipient and category of assistance). <lb/>Trade-related assistance has faced many critiques. According to Prowse (2002, p. 1 239), it <lb/> &quot; has been delivered frequently randomly, indiscriminately and more often than not on a <lb/>stand-alone basis &quot; . She points to the lack of co-ordination between multilateral agencies involved <lb/>in capacity building, such as the IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, UNDP, the World Bank and the WTO, not <lb/>to mention other specialised agencies (BIS, FAO, ISO, UNIDO, WCO, WIPO), regional bodies <lb/>and bilateral donors. Within the WTO, the implementation of the Special and Differential <lb/>treatment, by which a least-developed country might be given longer transition periods for the <lb/>implementation of GATT/WTO obligations and maintain some trade restrictions or subsidies, is <lb/>handled by each relevant WTO committee. For instance, the Committee on Sanitary and <lb/>Phytosanitary Standards will implement an assistance programme independently from the <lb/>13. Activities to enhance the infrastructure necessary for trade, such as transport, storage, communications or energy <lb/>are excluded. <lb/>14. These are UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP, WTO, IMF and the World Bank. The International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint <lb/>venture of the WTO and UNCTAD. The IF received $19 million in pledges through 2003, of which around <lb/>$10 million was disbursed through 2003. <lb/>15. The JITAP is a more a results-oriented programme than the IF. By September 2003, the JITAP had received <lb/>$12.6 million in its Common Trust Fund. <lb/></body>

			<body>committee on Intellectual Property Law. A consequence of this fragmentation of aid is that it is <lb/>often short-lived and is not integrated in a global development strategy of the country. <lb/>The IF initiative, intended to overcome these issues, remains mostly donor-driven and <lb/>lacks local ownership. The process involves Geneva-based representatives more than local <lb/>governments, and the local IF co-ordinator (the &quot; Focal Point &quot; ) usually resides in the trade <lb/>ministry, which most often has less political muscle than Ministries such as Planning or Finance <lb/>(and Customs). More profoundly, trade-related assistance suffers from conflicting rationales <lb/>(Shaffer, 2005). One is to facilitate trade liberalisation and the implementation of WTO <lb/>agreements; the other supports trade-related aspects of development, including the capacity to <lb/>re-negotiate WTO rules from a development perspective. The present emphasis rests clearly on <lb/>the former. The first domain in which the WTO designed trade assistance activities was the <lb/>Singapore Issues, among them intellectual property rights, which might not be a first-rank <lb/>concern for the least-developed countries (LDCs). A temptation even arose to link the <lb/>continuation of trade assistance to the conclusion of the Doha negotiating round. <lb/>The fragmentation of trade-related assistance does not help an overall assessment of its <lb/>impact on trade, not to say growth. The methodology used in the few available studies estimates <lb/>the costs of trade transactions and simulates the impact of a decrease in them. No study known <lb/>to the present authors directly evaluates the impact of trade assistance on reducing trade <lb/>transaction costs. An OECD report (2003) gives some estimates of those costs. They range from <lb/>1 per cent to 15 per cent of traded goods&apos; value. The computations are based mostly on business <lb/>surveys and make some assumptions for the opportunity costs (in monetary terms) of time delay <lb/>or inventory holding. Trade transaction costs seem higher for agricultural products (due to <lb/>additional sanitary and phytosanitary inspections). They also are higher for developing <lb/>countries, and considerable variation in border waiting times exists particularly for countries <lb/>with per capita incomes of less than $9 000. <lb/>Researchers have taken two routes based on these evaluations of trade transaction costs: <lb/>• Introducing trade transaction costs in a gravity model of bilateral trade, along<lb/>with the usual variables such as tariffs or distance. Examples are Wilson et al. <lb/>(2003) for APEC and Wilson et al. (2004) for a larger sample of 30 developed <lb/>countries and 45 developing countries. <lb/>• Introducing trade transaction costs in a CGE model (Hertel, 2004). Trade<lb/>facilitation is introduced as technical progress in trading activities that reduces the <lb/>cost of trading (indirect effect) and can entail a reduction in logistics duties paid to <lb/>the public sector (direct effect). Examples appear in Fox et al. (2003) and OECD <lb/>(2003). <lb/>Wilson et al. (2004) derive their measures of trade facilitation from cross-country business <lb/>surveys and build four indices — for port efficiency, the customs environment (hidden barriers <lb/>or bribes), the regulatory environment (corruption) and the service infrastructure (speed and cost <lb/>of internet access and its contribution to inventory reduction). These indicators correlate highly <lb/>with each other and with per capita incomes. The gravity model, which does not control for the <lb/>endogeneity of trade costs, shows that higher trade-facilitation index values indeed have a <lb/></body>

			<body>positive impact on bilateral trade, especially the service infrastructure and the regulatory <lb/>environment. Full elimination of the 8.5 per cent average tariff would equate for the importing <lb/>country to improvements of 15.6 per cent in port efficiency, 17 per cent in the regulatory <lb/>environment and 6.6 per cent in the service infrastructure. The corresponding gains for the <lb/>exporter are 5.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 7.8 per cent. The tariff elimination also is equivalent to <lb/>a 10 per cent better customs environment for the importer. When the sample is restricted to <lb/>South-North trade, variables of the North as importer, such as tariffs, are not significant. Thus, <lb/>the regression would suggest that tariffs are not an impediment to South-North trade. A high <lb/>coefficient on the regulatory environment in the exporting country (from the South) points to <lb/>possible large gains following its reform. In South-South trade, tariffs are significant and the <lb/>service infrastructure is important for trade in both directions. The estimates of the gravity model <lb/>are then used for simulation. If below-average countries are put at a level halfway to the average <lb/>for the entire set of countries, the volume of trade will increase by 9.7 per cent ($377 billion). The <lb/>gain will be smaller for Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), sub-Saharan African and <lb/>Latin American exports than for South Asian exports, because they have less access to OECD <lb/>markets. <lb/>The CGE simulations in OECD (2003) take into account a loss in logistic duties and <lb/>reduced corruption following trade facilitation. Thus, the positive impact is attenuated by an <lb/>adjustment in the government sector. They also model diversity in trade transaction costs due to <lb/>sectors&apos; and firms&apos; heterogeneity. They show that an overall and uniform reduction of trade <lb/>transaction costs by 1 per cent of the value of world trade would entail a trade gain of $38 billion. <lb/>Reducing border waiting times accounts for 80 per cent of it. Most of it would go to OECD <lb/>countries (69 per cent) and to a lesser extent the Asia-Pacific Region. MENA and the Latin <lb/>America/Caribbean (LAC) region would each get 5 per cent of the benefit and sub-Saharan <lb/>Africa a mere 2 per cent. If the improvement in trade facilitation results in closing the gap to best <lb/>practice (that is, the lower the initial level, the larger the improvement), non-OECD countries <lb/>receive 63 per cent of the gain in trade (Table 1). In turn, these trade gains result in a welfare <lb/>improvement of 0.13 per cent of GDP worldwide. This figure can rise to 0.85 per cent of GDP for <lb/>sub-Saharan Africa in a scenario with differential improvement in trade transaction costs. Again, <lb/>however, the study reports no results on growth or income distribution. <lb/>For least-developed countries, including many sub-Saharan African countries, the <lb/>potential benefit of trade facilitation programmes (or reductions in trade transaction costs) seems <lb/>to depend on improvement of their market access 16 . Industrialised countries have designed <lb/>preferential schemes to facilitate access to their markets for developing countries, such as the <lb/>generalised system of preferences (GSP), or more recently, the EU&apos;s &quot; Everything but Arms &quot; <lb/>initiative and the US African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA). Recent studies point to under-<lb/>use of these preferences (Brenton, 2003; UNCTAD, 2003; Candau et al., 2004). Reasons include the <lb/>extent of product coverage (especially for agriculture and textiles) and the costs of <lb/>16. Anecdotal evidence points to contradictory objectives in trade-related assistance and market-access policies. Bogart <lb/>and Trzeciak-Duval mention that the EU announced in February 2004 an Action plan on Commodities to favour <lb/>diversification in exports from the developing countries. Yet the EU restricted market access for some of the <lb/>commodities targeted by the action plan, such as sugar and rice (Bogart and Trzeciak-Duval, 2004, p.12). <lb/></body>

This is a <lb/>significant gap in the literature. Case studies planned for the present OECD Development Centre <lb/>project may help to bridge the gap by gathering country-level data.

In the absence of complete evaluation of <lb/>how trade-facilitation activities affect trade flows and development outcomes, the existing <lb/>papers tend to hope that reduction in trade transaction costs will have a significant effect <lb/>provided that developing countries have sufficient market access in the North. Such arguments <lb/>might point to a possible complementarity between aid and market-access policies in the North. <lb/></body>

			<body>© OECD 2006 <lb/>28 <lb/>III. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FDI AND TRADE <lb/>III.1 Conceptual Aspects <lb/>Standard Trade Theory and Factor Mobility <lb/>One can consider FDI as simply a factor movement between two countries and examine <lb/>how it affects trade volumes between them (F1 in Figure 1). In the standard Heckscher-Ohlin <lb/>model of trade with two countries, two factors and two goods, the traditional view is that factor <lb/>mobility (particularly capital mobility or FDI) substitutes perfectly for goods mobility, i.e. trade. <lb/>In the first formal exposition of this idea Mundell (1957) noted that in the presence of tariffs, the <lb/>relatively low-priced factor in each country will be that country&apos;s abundant factor. Factor <lb/>mobility in response to international factor-price differences would thus lead to the elimination <lb/>of trade by eliminating the factor-proportion basis for it. Perfect factor mobility would produce <lb/>an international equilibrium in which factor prices and commodity prices are identical to those <lb/>characterising a free-trade equilibrium with factor immobility. According to this view, factor <lb/>movements and commodity trade are substitutes in both the welfare and volume-of-trade senses, <lb/>and more FDI flows should associate with less trade. In an important contribution Markusen <lb/>(1984) extends the Mundell analysis to show a number of situations in which factor movements <lb/>(FDI in particular) and goods trade in fact complement one another in the sense that increased <lb/>factor movements between two economies lead increased trade flows. The basic idea considers <lb/>the following set of assumptions: <lb/>a) countries have identical relative factor endowments; <lb/>b) countries have identical technologies; <lb/>c) countries have identical homothetic preferences; <lb/>d) production has constant returns to scale; <lb/>e) production is characterised by perfect competition; and, <lb/>f) there are no domestic distortions in either country. <lb/>Under these assumptions, two countries have no reason to trade with each other. <lb/>Relaxing only assumption a) provides the standard Heckscher-Ohlin motive for trade in <lb/>commodities. Markusen (1984) showed that retaining a) but relaxing assumptions b), d), e) or f) <lb/>provides a reason for a complementarity between factor movements and trade. The basic <lb/>intuition is that, in all of these cases at the initial trading equilibrium with no factor mobility, <lb/>there is no factor-price equalisation; a country will have a relatively high factor price for the <lb/></body>

			<body>factor used intensively in the production of its export sector. Thus factor mobility must lead to an <lb/>inflow of the factor used intensively in the production of the export good. This in turn adds a <lb/>factor-proportion basis for trade and an increase in the volume of trade between the <lb/>two economies. Taken together, these different models suggest the general idea that trade flows <lb/>and FDI flows are substitutes in only a restricted set of circumstances. They will most likely be <lb/>complements when technologies differ across countries, when there are external or <lb/>agglomeration economies of scale, when firms compete in oligopolistic fashion and when there <lb/>are local distortions in product or factor markets. <lb/>Standard Trade Theory and Interactions between FDI and Trade Policies <lb/>The ideas outlined above deal with commodity trade and factor movements, but they do <lb/>not address the interactions between FDI and trade policy instruments and their welfare impacts <lb/>on the host country. Johnson (1967b) showed in an early contribution that an exogenous increase <lb/>in the stock of a domestic resource, capital for example, might bring a welfare loss in a tariff-<lb/>ridden, small and open economy if it exacerbates overproduction of the protected import-<lb/>competing industry. Clearly, if a discrepancy also arises between domestic product and national <lb/>income because the increase in the capital stock is foreign-owned (FDI), then it is even more <lb/>likely that national welfare may decrease. Brecher and Diaz-Alejandro (1977), Markusen and <lb/>Melvin (1979) and Brecher and Bhagwati (1981) all note that tariff-generated FDI may reduce the <lb/>real income of the host country or even of the world as a whole. Tariffs imply that a reduction of <lb/>imports at constant terms of trade depresses national income by lowering the volume of trade. If <lb/>tariff-generated FDI has the Mundell effect of curtailing trade, this tends to lessen income in the <lb/>absence of a favourable terms-of-trade change. This result therefore reveals situations where a <lb/>tariff reduction in the host economy tends to increase the welfare gain associated with FDI flows. <lb/>Looking at instruments, this suggests that a trade liberalisation policy may complement an FDI <lb/>policy promoting capital movements. <lb/>Bhagwati and Brecher (1980) and Brecher and Bhagwati (1981) show that free trade may <lb/>be inferior to subsidised trade or no trade for a large country when it has a foreign-owned <lb/>domestic factor of production (like FDI capital). This comes from the discrepancy in the volume <lb/>or pattern of trade between the economy as perceived in the aggregate (with both domestically <lb/>and foreign-owned factors) and the economy as perceived from the national point of view <lb/>(domestic factors only). All this line of research suggests that trade liberalisation (and even <lb/>subsidisation in some cases) in the host country may at the margin complement FDI <lb/>liberalisation from the welfare point of view, because it decreases the likelihood of the <lb/>Johnson/Bhagwati-Brecher phenomenon when an FDI inflow occurs. <lb/>The New Trade Theory and Multinationals <lb/>Research in the early 1980s saw the beginning of the industrial-organisation approach to <lb/>trade. It brought increasing returns to scale and imperfect competition into the general <lb/>equilibrium model of trade. Two branches of this line of research discuss the relationship <lb/>between trade and FDI. The first describes multinational and FDI activities as &quot; vertical FDI &quot; in <lb/>the sense that single-plant firms fragment the production process into stages based on factor <lb/>intensities and locate activities according to international differences in factor prices (Helpman, <lb/></body>

			<body>1984, 1985; Helpman and Krugman, 1985). Multinational activity will arise between countries <lb/>that differ in factor endowments. The second branch considers &quot; horizontal FDI &quot; and emphasises <lb/>the role of firm-level and plant-level economies of scale as well as trade costs between countries <lb/>(Brainard, 1993; Markusen and Venables, 1998, 2000). Contrary to the vertical FDI model, the <lb/>horizontal FDI model predicts that, given moderate to high trade costs, multinational activity <lb/>arises between countries similar in size and relative factor endowments. Markusen (1997, 2001) <lb/>integrated the two branches into what is now known as the &quot; capital-knowledge &quot; approach, <lb/>stressing the role of skill-intensive, knowledge-based assets that can be fragmented from <lb/>production and become joint inputs into multiple production facilities. <lb/>What does this new approach tell us about the complementarity or substitutability <lb/>between FDI and trade flows? Clearly, affiliate production and trade flows should be substitutes <lb/>in the &quot; horizontal &quot; approach, although the relationship can become subtler when the firm <lb/>produces both intermediate and final goods. It is also reasonable to say that affiliate production <lb/>complements trade in the &quot; vertical &quot; approach. Markusen and Maskus (2002) draw out the <lb/>implications of how FDI liberalisation affects trade flows. The type of FDI (and therefore the <lb/>impact on trade flows between two countries) depends on differences in country size, relative <lb/>skill endowments and trade costs. More precisely, when countries are similar in size and relative <lb/>factor endowments and trade costs are moderate to high, FDI liberalisation tends to stimulate <lb/> &quot; horizontal FDI &quot; and to reduce exports from the source country to the host country. On the other <lb/>hand, when countries differ in relative factor endowments and in size and trade costs are low, <lb/>then FDI liberalisation will likely stimulate &quot; vertical FDI &quot; and promote trade — through exports <lb/>of intermediates from the source to the host country or of assembled products from the host-<lb/>country export platform back to the source country or to a third destination. <lb/>The New Trade Theory and Interactions between FDI and Trade Policies <lb/>Markusen (1997) provides a variation of the same argument, concentrating directly on the <lb/>relationship between trade and investment liberalisation from the viewpoint of a small, <lb/>developing host economy facing a large, developed source country. This is one of the very few <lb/>papers that explicitly consider the degree of complementarity or substitutability between two <lb/>policy instruments rather than the relationship between trade and FDI flows (the policy <lb/>outcomes). While precise results derive from numerical simulations and therefore depend on the <lb/>configuration of parameters, three general conclusions emerge. First, investment and trade <lb/>liberalisation do not seem to be substitutes in that they often have opposite effects on important <lb/>variables (like sectoral outputs, factor rewards, etc.). Second, they have quite different effects <lb/>together than does either one alone. For instance, FDI liberalisation alone may lead to horizontal <lb/>FDI, but coupled with trade liberalisation it may promote vertical FDI. In a welfare sense, trade <lb/>and investment liberalisation serve as complements. Finally from a distributive point of view, <lb/>they may together avoid the curse of Stolper-Samuelson, in the sense that the real incomes of all <lb/>factors can rise under full liberalisation, even if the relative price of one factor may fall. <lb/></body>

			<body>III.2 Empirical Analyses of FDI and Trade <lb/>Many empirical studies have examined the relationship between trade and FDI. As with <lb/>the aid and trade relationship, the outcomes are quite mixed. The difficulty arises because <lb/>empirical work must take into account different stages of production, intra-firm and inter-firm <lb/>trade and the effects on third countries. Therefore it needs very disaggregated data. The first <lb/>studies looked at the impact of FDI on exports from the point of view of the source country, <lb/>i.e. FDIN,S1 versus EN,S1 in Figure 2. They found that trade and investment are complements. Lipsey <lb/>and Weiss (1981), for instance, found a positive effect of US firms&apos; foreign production on US <lb/>exports. <lb/>Figure 2. FDI/Trade Relationships <lb/>N: Home (Source) Country <lb/>S1: FDI Host Country <lb/>S2: Third Country <lb/>FDIN,S1 <lb/>FDI <lb/>Trade in Intermediate <lb/>Goods (I) <lb/>IN,S1 <lb/>IS2,S1 <lb/>Trade in Final Goods (F) <lb/>FN,S! <lb/>Total Exports (E) of Country <lb/>S1 <lb/>ES1,N <lb/>ES1,S2 <lb/>EN,S1 <lb/>Total Exports (E) of Country <lb/>N <lb/>EN,S2 <lb/>The picture changes however, when one introduces different stages of production and <lb/>disaggregates exports into flows of intermediate and finished goods. Lipsey and Weiss (1984) <lb/>found a strong complementarity between affiliate production and exports of intermediate goods, <lb/>but no significant relationship between affiliate production and exports of finished goods. <lb/>Belderbos and Sleuwaegen (1998) find evidence of substitution between foreign production and <lb/>trade at the firm level when import protection or voluntary export restraints (VERs) threaten <lb/>firms in the destination market. This &quot; tariff jumping &quot; investment substitutes for trade, as they <lb/>show for Japanese electronic firms in Europe during 1986-88. On the other hand, Japanese firms <lb/>that acquired European firms or invested in distribution subsidiaries exported relatively more to <lb/>Europe. Bloningen (2001), looking at product-level data on Japanese automobiles and automobile <lb/>parts exported to or produced in the United States, identifies large substitution effects in <lb/>consumer goods between US-based affiliates and Japanese exports. On the other hand, increased <lb/>demand for imported inputs in vertical relationships stems from complementarity. <lb/></body>

			<body>In a dynamic perspective, Bergsten et al. (1978) found that an initial complementarity <lb/>turns to substitution as the host country gains competitiveness and becomes an export platform. <lb/>Their analysis introduces the effects on third countries (in Figure 2, ES2,S1). Trade between <lb/>affiliates (say, in countries S1 and S2) might eventually replace trade between the home country <lb/>and the affiliate in S1. Integrating both the different stages of production and the third-country <lb/>effect, Svensson (1996) shows with Swedish data that exports of intermediate goods from the <lb/>source country increase (IN,S1), and exports of final goods decrease (FN,S1), the net effect being <lb/>close to zero and negative when the third-country effect is taken into account (the replacement of <lb/>exports from the source country to the third country, EN,S2, by exports from the host country, <lb/>ES1,S2). <lb/>The relevant question for developing countries will concern the impact of inward FDI on <lb/>their exports and imports. In terms of Figure 2, answering it would require data on gross exports <lb/>and imports of source and the host countries and restricting the sample to North-South FDI. <lb/>Fontagné and Pajot (1997, 1999) take a first step in this direction by distinguishing inward and <lb/>outward FDI on the one hand and exports and imports on the other. They show clearly <lb/>asymmetric effects for a given country. The samples, however, contain data on 14 industrial <lb/>countries (11 in Europe, the United States, Japan and the EU12) and one &quot; partner country &quot; which <lb/>accounts for the rest of the world. In fact, they work with two datasets, one disaggregated at the <lb/>industry level for France only, the other taking FDI as a whole for 14 declaring countries facing <lb/>15 partners over the years 1984-93. Their regression takes the form: <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Tij = T(GDPi, GDPj , ∆GDPij, Yi , Yj , ∆Yij, DISTij , REGij , PRODi, FDIji, FDIji ) <lb/>where GDPi is the GDP of country i, ∆GDPij is the difference in GDP between the two countries, <lb/>Yi is income per capita in country, i, ∆Yij is the difference in per capita income, DISTij measures <lb/>distance, REGij is a dummy indicating a regional trade agreement , PRODi is average industry <lb/>productivity, FDIji is inward FDI and FDIji is outward FDI. <lb/>Table 2 summarises the results. In manufacturing, a $1 FDI outflow from France generates <lb/>24 cents of imports from the host country, but the trade balance is in favour of France, with a net <lb/>export of 35 cents. The result is robust to the introduction of productivity effects (economies of <lb/>scale) or to considering all sectors. In the larger data set, an FDI outflow of $1 generates 31 cents <lb/>of imports. But again, the foreign investment creates net exports from the source country of $1.86 <lb/>(=2.17-0.31). Thus foreign investment creates net exports for a source country, revealing a <lb/>complementarity between FDI and trade for the source country and a substitution for the host <lb/>country. This analysis ignores potential productivity benefits arising from importing inputs that <lb/>might be sophisticated enough to entail technology transfers. <lb/>A proper testing of the FDI-trade relationship is difficult in a way similar to testing the <lb/>aid and trade relationship, because of problems of simultaneity (endogeneity of FDI in the trade <lb/>equation) and direction of the causality. Moreover, theory predicts that firms&apos; heterogeneity <lb/>matters. If FDI is vertical, multinational firms split their stages of production among various <lb/>locations, which will likely enhance trade. If FDI is horizontal, they produce final goods in <lb/>multiple locations, which will likely substitute for trade. Unfortunately, there is no way to <lb/>distinguish between horizontal and vertical FDI in the data. <lb/>Amiti and Wakelin (2003) address these problems in a novel way. They start from <lb/>Markusen&apos;s model (1997) and derive testable implications for complementarity or substitution <lb/>between trade and FDI depending on the size of the countries, differences in factor (skill) <lb/>endowments and trade costs. They estimate a gravity model of bilateral exports as a function of <lb/>trade and investment costs in the countries of origin and destination of exports. They measure <lb/>investment costs by an index of various impediments to investment (government restrictions on <lb/>foreign companies, immigration rules, restrictions on raising capital and anti-trust laws) 17 . They <lb/>also introduce interaction terms of investment costs with differences in country size and in skill <lb/>endowments. The interaction terms are meant to capture the non-linearity in the relation <lb/>between trade and FDI liberalisation. The model is estimated for each year from 1986-94 on a <lb/>sample of 36 countries including 13 developing countries. Of particular note are the partial <lb/>derivatives of exports with respect to investment costs in the destination and origin countries of <lb/>the trade flows (reproduced here for 1994): <lb/>ln <lb/>5.15 0.13ln <lb/>0.27 ln <lb/>0.81ln <lb/>ln <lb/>ij <lb/>ijt <lb/>ijt <lb/>jt <lb/>j <lb/>X <lb/>DY <lb/>D S K I L L <lb/>T C <lb/>IC <lb/>∂ <lb/>= − <lb/>+ <lb/>− <lb/>+ <lb/>∂ <lb/>17. The investment cost index is the simple average of scores from the World Economic Forum surveys on foreign <lb/>investor controls, immigration laws, cross-border ventures, hiring practice, anti-trust laws, state of justice, state of <lb/>capital markets, and protection of intellectual property rights. The index ranges from 0 to 100 with higher values <lb/>indicating higher investment impediments. <lb/></body>

Therefore, investment liberalisation in the North should enhance exports from <lb/>developing countries, as long as trade costs are not too high. On the other hand, if country i <lb/>reduces its investment cost, the difference in skills between the two countries does not matter for <lb/>trade flows and the trade-cost variable switches sign from negative in the early years to positive <lb/>after 1991. The interactive term between investment cost and country size (ln DYij*ln IC) has an <lb/>unexpected positive sign. Amiti and Wakelin relate that finding to the replacement of national <lb/>firms likely to be big exporters by multinationals when investment costs fall. <lb/>To summarise, Amiti and Wakelin find that when factor endowments are different in <lb/>two countries and trade costs are low, vertical FDI will occur, enhancing intra-firm trade and <lb/>increasing exports, provided that the difference in country size is not too large. When the <lb/>two countries are similar in factor endowments and trade costs are high, horizontal FDI that will <lb/>substitute for exports becomes more likely. Using data from 1994, they show that 70 per cent of <lb/>their sample exhibits a negative derivative for <lb/>ln <lb/>ln <lb/>ij <lb/>j <lb/>X <lb/>IC <lb/>∂ <lb/>∂ <lb/>, i.e. a complementarity between <lb/>investment liberalisation and trade. The average elasticity was –0.15 in 1994, down from –0.53 in <lb/>1986. As country characteristics and trade costs change over time, the impact of investment <lb/>liberalisation on trade does not stay constant either. The implication for a developing country <lb/>would be that investment liberalisation should accompany trade liberalisation in order to <lb/>magnify the complementarity between trade and investment, which the difference in factor <lb/>endowments will enhance. All in all, the empirical literature on the impact of FDI on trade <lb/>suggests complementarity for developing countries. The result is specific, however, to the type of <lb/>FDI (horizontal or vertical), the stage of production (intermediate or final) touched by the FDI <lb/>inflow and the potential technological spillovers associated with it. Third-country effects seem <lb/>important, as well as the evolution over time. All these parameters are difficult to gather, but <lb/>doing so might be feasible for some case studies. <lb/></body>

			<body>IV. CONCLUSION <lb/>This survey has some implications for the case studies envisioned in the current OECD <lb/>Development Centre project. What has this review of the literature revealed? A first, quite robust <lb/>element is the identification of complementarity between trade and FDI flows and policies. There <lb/>are theoretical arguments for it, and the few empirical papers addressing this issue directly <lb/>support them. An important policy implication, however, lies in the risk of a two-tier system in <lb/>which emerging developing countries (East Asia, South Asia and China) would attract both <lb/>investment and trade while other less-developed economies (in sub-Saharan Africa) would not. <lb/>On the other hand, the literature so far does not provide straightforward and robust <lb/>results on complementarity between aid and trade flows. Yet there is a presumption of possible <lb/>complementarity between aid and trade policy that would reduce domestic distortions in the <lb/>developing country (e.g. provision of a public good or domestic market reforms). In the classical <lb/> &quot; aid vs. trade &quot; debate, the theoretical arguments would urge aid, a more direct instrument, over <lb/>market access. The balance might change, however, if countervailing terms-of-trade effects are <lb/>significant (immiserising aid) and if learning through exports is possible through productivity <lb/>gains in exporting firms that might spill over to non-exporting firms. These conditions seem <lb/>relevant for a stylised African economy but remain to be verified in real cases. The reasoning <lb/>treats only marginal effects, however. <lb/>The cross-country empirical literature, while suggesting some complementarities across <lb/>policy areas like trade, FDI and aid policies, faces a number of important limitations that more <lb/>detailed case-study analyses may overcome. First, most complementarity results are based on <lb/>measures of flows rather than of the policy instruments. This causes problems because many <lb/>different unobserved factors may affect the relationships between instruments and observed <lb/>flows. Second, these analyses do not take into account how institutional details may affect the <lb/>pattern of complementarities across policy areas in a given country. This may be crucial for <lb/>policy implementation. Third, cross-country analyses give an aggregate view of the policy areas <lb/>under investigation. They do not distinguish between various instruments within a given policy <lb/>area (trade, FDI or aid) and therefore give at best an average view of the impacts of these <lb/>instruments and their interactions. They also are ill suited for understanding the impact of <lb/>lagged effects and interactions, because the identification power of the regressions often comes <lb/>more from inter-country variability than from time variability. Finally, they consider aggregate <lb/>policy impacts in countries without discussing the distributive implications within them. This <lb/>precludes the consideration of political-economy issues, which again may be quite important. <lb/>Country case studies can overcome some of these problems, particularly by <lb/>disaggregating policy instruments. Policies for trade, FDI and aid are in fact multidimensional <lb/></body>

			<body>vectors. More formally, for a given country i, policy vectors could be defined as [Trdkt], [Frdkt] and <lb/>[Ardkt], where T, F and A correspond to trade, FDI and aid policies, and r refers to the recipient or <lb/>host country, d to a donor or source country interacting with i, k to a particular policy instrument <lb/>and t to a time period. The disaggregation of the policy vector Z ε {T,F,A} between policy <lb/>instruments may have important implications for bringing to light the issue of substitutability or <lb/>complementarity between two instruments within and across policy areas. First, two different <lb/>instruments, Zk and Zk&apos;, within the same policy area, Z ε {T,F,A}, may indeed have differential <lb/>impacts when interacting with another policy area, W ε {T,F,A}. Think, for instance, of tariffs <lb/>versus quantitative restrictions within the trade policy vector T. It is well known that they may <lb/>have different economic impacts, making it quite likely that they may also have different <lb/>interactions with another policy vector like F (FDI) or A (aid). Second, two instruments, Zk and <lb/>Wk񮽙 in two different policy vectors, Z ε {T,F,A} and W ε {T,F,A}, may also generate different <lb/>forms of complementarity or substitution than two other instruments, Zk񮽙񮽙 and Wk񮽙񮽙 &apos; in their <lb/>respective policy areas. Disentangling these finely grained forms of interaction goes beyond <lb/>analyses based on average measures of policy and may be quite important for effective policy <lb/>implementation. The disaggregation of the policy vectors of the source/donor country, Zd and <lb/>Zd&apos;, is also important. It should naturally illuminate the question of policy coherence and <lb/>complementarity in these countries. It may also reveal how for a given country different <lb/>instruments within or across policy areas interact with those of another source/donor country. <lb/>Finally, the time dimension t is obviously important, to exploit the dynamics of interactions <lb/>across policy areas and understand the nature of lags and delays that may appear in country i. <lb/>Country case studies can more closely investigate three key issues. First, they can <lb/>characterise more precisely the local determinants of complementarity between policy areas. <lb/>Case studies may allow more focus on how other domestic market distortions (like labour or <lb/>capital market distortions) and local governance problems (corruption, local capture and politics) <lb/>may interfere with policy and the implementation of particular instruments within each policy <lb/>area. Second, they can explore distributive and political-economy questions. Typically, one may <lb/>expect from case studies a more disaggregated view of the impact and interactions of various <lb/>policies. Understanding who are the likely winners and losers can be important for the political <lb/>feasibility of implementing policy reforms. Finally, case studies can detect how interactions <lb/>across policy areas diffuse over time within the economy and how temporary or permanent <lb/>shocks may affect them. Here, the task is to identify the importance of lags and delays and the <lb/>role of expectations of future policy changes. <lb/></body>
