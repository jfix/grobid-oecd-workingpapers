At the same time, however, there are <lb/>concerns about whether all regions will gain from more autonomy. Decentralisation may not lift all boats, <lb/>with &quot; poor &quot; regions losing competitiveness with respect to better endowed ones, thus increasing regional <lb/>disparities. The present work investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional <lb/>inequality within countries. Particular attention is paid to the different channels through which <lb/>decentralisation can affect disparities: taxing powers, spending autonomy and the vertical fiscal imbalance. <lb/>The empirical analysis, which is conducted on a sample of 30 OECD countries for the period 1995-2011, <lb/>suggests that a balanced fiscal structure, where local spending is mainly financed by local taxation, reduces <lb/>regional disparities, by providing an incentive to better use local resources and implement policies that <lb/>favour economic development. <lb/>Keywords: Fiscal decentralisation, regional inequality, panel data <lb/>JEL Classification: H71; H77; R11 <lb/>***** <lb/>RESUME <lb/>Décentralisation budgétaire et disparités régionales <lb/>Si la décentralisation budgétaire peut permettre d&apos;améliorer l&apos;efficience de la fourniture des biens et <lb/>services publics locaux et promouvoir une meilleure adéquation entre les politiques publiques et les <lb/>préférences des citoyens, la question de savoir si toutes les régions peuvent tirer parti d&apos;une plus grande <lb/>autonomie est source de préoccupation. Il est possible que la décentralisation ne profite pas à toutes les <lb/>régions, et qu&apos;elle se traduise, pour les régions « pauvres » par une perte de compétitivité par rapport à <lb/>d&apos;autres mieux dotées, exacerbant ainsi les disparités régionales.

Une <lb/>attention particulière y est accordée aux différents vecteurs par lesquels la décentralisation peut influer sur <lb/>les disparités : compétences en matière fiscale, autonomie au niveau des dépenses et déséquilibre <lb/>budgétaire vertical. Cette analyse empirique menée à partir d&apos;un échantillon de 30 pays de l&apos;OCDE sur la <lb/>période 1995-2011, tend à démontrer qu&apos;une structure budgétaire équilibrée, dans laquelle les dépenses <lb/>locales sont financées essentiellement par la fiscalité locale, a pour effet de réduire les disparités <lb/>régionales, car elle incite à une meilleure utilisation des ressources locales et à la mise en oeuvre de <lb/>politiques qui favorisent le développement économique. <lb/>Mots-clés : décentralisation budgétaire, inégalités régionales, données de panel <lb/>Classification JEL : H71 ; H77 ; R11 <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)54 <lb/></front>

			<body>FISCAL DECENTRALISATION AND REGIONAL DISPARITIES <lb/>By David Bartolini, Sibylle Stossberg and Hansjörg Blöchliger 1 <lb/>1. Introduction and main findings <lb/>1. <lb/>Differences in GDP per capita across OECD countries have decreased over the past twenty years. <lb/>This process of economic convergence, however, masks increasing disparities within most countries. The <lb/>average level of inter-regional disparities in per capita GDP is currently above the level of cross-country <lb/>disparities. At the same time, many countries underwent far-reaching reforms to their intergovernmental <lb/>fiscal frameworks, such as the devolution of new responsibilities in education, health care or economic <lb/>affairs, and the assignment of additional taxing powers. Views differ sharply about whether fiscal <lb/>federalism reforms will further deepen regional disparities or, on the contrary might help regions converge. <lb/>While some point out that decentralisation provides jurisdictions with the incentives and the capacity for <lb/>growth-oriented policy, thereby fostering convergence, others point out that devolution could exacerbate <lb/>differences in regional competitiveness. <lb/>2. <lb/>An important element of this debate is the source of revenue used by sub-national governments to <lb/>finance local spending. There are two main sources: own resources and transfers from other levels of <lb/>government. Own resources (such as local taxation and fees for services) provide the local government <lb/>with a strong incentive to enlarge the tax base, becoming more competitive and more efficient in the use of <lb/>resources, which enhances regional growth but not necessarily convergence. Transfers tend to equalise the <lb/>fiscal capacity of regions, thus allowing common standards of public goods across the country, but provide <lb/>little incentive for lagging regions to catch up with the frontier – especially if the gains in terms of <lb/>increased tax base are captured by the central government. <lb/>3. <lb/>This paper sheds light on the role played by intergovernmental fiscal frameworks in shaping <lb/>regional economic development. The main findings are: <lb/>1. <lb/>Hansjörg Blöchliger and David Bartolini are in the Economics Department and the Public Governance and <lb/>Territorial Development Directorate of the OECD and Sibylle Stossberg is with the German Federal <lb/>Ministry of Finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen).

			<body> Tax and revenue decentralisation, measured by the share of sub-central government (SCG) tax <lb/>(or revenue) on total tax (or revenue), tend to reduce regional disparities; for instance, a 10 <lb/>percentage point increase in revenue decentralisation reduces regional disparities by 11% (or 4 <lb/>basis points of the coefficient of variation). The reduction of regional disparities seems to be <lb/>driven by the responsibility to raise tax revenue as shown by the significant impact of two <lb/>indicators of tax autonomy: the Regional Authority Index (RAI) and the OECD tax autonomy <lb/>index. <lb/> By contrast, the vertical fiscal imbalance – an indicator of the share of spending not financed <lb/>through own resources – is associated with larger regional disparities. The estimation results of <lb/>the impact of the vertical fiscal imbalance support the hypothesis that the reduction of regional <lb/>disparities passes through the incentive to raise own resources to finance sub-central spending. <lb/> The disparity-reducing effect is particularly strong at the extremes of the distribution, i.e. for the <lb/>richest and poorest jurisdictions. The ratio between the top 10 th percentile and the bottom 10 th <lb/>percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP is most affected by fiscal <lb/>decentralisation. <lb/> The impact of revenue decentralisation on the incentive to activate regional sources of growth is <lb/>confirmed by the results of a growth regression conducted on the top and bottom 25 th percentile <lb/>of the distribution of regional per capita GDP within countries. The positive impact of tax <lb/>decentralisation on GDP per capita growth is stronger in lagging regions, where there is more <lb/>scope for activating or using local resources more efficiently, than in leading regions. <lb/>4. <lb/>These results suggest that decentralisation should be implemented in a balanced way, with sub-<lb/>central spending largely covered by own (tax) revenue. Transfers from the central government, are <lb/>beneficial to the extent that they do not counteract the incentive to raise tax revenues. Indeed, while central <lb/>government transfers may be necessary – in the short run – to achieve national common standards of sub-<lb/>central public goods and services, the analysis shows that a trade-off exists with the incentives necessary to <lb/>foster regional conversion. <lb/>5. <lb/>The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework and <lb/>the existing empirical evidence on the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities, <lb/>and also includes a discussion of the main channels through which fiscal decentralisation affects regional <lb/>disparities; next, Section 3, provides a discussion of the methodology used to measure regional inequality <lb/>and fiscal decentralisation, and a description of the empirical strategy; Section 4, describes the estimation <lb/>results, and provides a discussion of their robustness; finally, Section 5, extends the analysis by <lb/>considering the impact of fiscal decentralisation on percentile ratios and on the growth rate of high and low <lb/>income regions. <lb/>2. Fiscal decentralisation and regional inequality <lb/>2.1. Theoretical framework <lb/>6. <lb/>Intergovernmental fiscal frameworks – the allocation of responsibilities and resources across <lb/>government levels – are part of the institutional set-up affecting regional convergence or divergence. The <lb/>predominant view is that fiscal decentralisation, while increasing the efficiency of sub-central public <lb/>finances, may induce greater regional disparities (Besley and Ghatak, 2003). A larger role of sub-central <lb/>governments induces a better match of policies with citizens&apos; preferences (Oates, 1972), thus increasing <lb/>efficiency, but it also reduces the scope for central government intra-regional transfers, which aim at <lb/></body>

			<body>reducing regional income differences (Prud&apos;homme, 1995). As such, there are arguments both in favour of <lb/>an &quot; equalising &quot; role of fiscal decentralisation and of a &quot; diverging &quot; role. <lb/> Proponents of fiscal decentralisation argue that the potential for growth is larger in &quot; poor &quot; or <lb/>lagging regions than in rich regions. Fiscal decentralisation operates through the incentive to <lb/>better use local resources for growth, for which there should be more scope in lagging regions <lb/>than in regions that are already at the efficiency frontier (Rodriguez-Posé and Ezcurra, 2010). <lb/>Through this channel fiscal decentralisation can ignite a virtuous process of regional <lb/>convergence. Moreover, fiscal decentralisation can help jurisdictions beat the forces of <lb/>agglomeration: fiscal autonomy represents an essential instrument for peripheral jurisdictions to <lb/>compete with the gravitational pull of agglomerations (Baldwin and Krugman, 2004) <lb/> Sceptics of fiscal decentralisation argue that only well-endowed regions would benefit from fiscal <lb/>decentralisation, thus increasing regional disparities. In particular, the playing field is considered <lb/>uneven with important differences in institutional capacity (financial capacity and competence of <lb/>the local administration) and in socioeconomic endowments (productivity, infrastructure, etc.) <lb/>(Rodriguez-Posé and Gill, 2005). Furthermore, competition for mobile factors of production is <lb/>likely to lead to a &quot; race to the bottom &quot; with inefficiently low tax rates, thus accentuating the <lb/>problems of less well-endowed regions (Wilson, 2015). Finally, even if tax competition leads to <lb/>an efficient allocation of resources, as in the voting-with-your-feet model of Tiebout (1956), <lb/>regional disparities may increase. <lb/>2.2. Evidence from empirical studies <lb/>7. <lb/>The empirical literature has only recently started to investigate the links between fiscal <lb/>decentralisation and regional disparities. One of the first contributions is Shankar and Shah (2003) who <lb/>propose a comprehensive discussion of the methodology and investigate the relationship between regional <lb/>disparities and federal countries, suggesting that federal countries cope better with regional inequality than <lb/>unitary countries because policies are less interventionist and focus on promoting factor mobility and <lb/>minimum standards across the federation. A more direct investigation of the link is conducted by <lb/>Rodriguez-Posé and Gill (2004). They compare national trends in fiscal decentralisation and regional <lb/>disparities for the period 1980-2000, finding that decentralisation increases disparities because it fosters <lb/>agglomeration effects. These studies, however, were all conducted with cross-section methodologies, thus <lb/>the time dimension was not considered. <lb/>8. <lb/>Lessmann (2006) considers both a cross-section and a panel of 17 OECD countries over the <lb/>period 1980-2001. The author considers an econometric model where the coefficient of variation of <lb/>regional per capita GDP is regressed on several indicators of fiscal decentralisation (separately <lb/>considered), and a set of national characteristics that are supposed to affect regional inequality. The results <lb/>of both the OLS estimation and the fixed effect estimation show that all indicators of fiscal decentralisation <lb/>significantly reduce regional disparities. These results are confirmed by Lessman (2009), who conducts a <lb/>similar analysis in a sample of 23 OECD countries for the period 1982-2000, and by Ezcurra and Pascual <lb/>(2008) who restrict the analysis to a panel of 12 EU countries and to expenditure decentralisation. <lb/>9. <lb/>The abovementioned results may depend on the type of countries considered, i.e. developed <lb/>countries. Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra (2010) conjecture that the impact of fiscal decentralisation depends <lb/>on the level of economic development. Using a panel of 26 countries (19 high income and 7 low income), <lb/>they find that political and expenditure decentralisation reduces regional disparities only in high income <lb/>countries, while considerably increasing them in low income countries. Lessman (2012) confirms the <lb/>importance of the level of economic development using a panel of 54 countries over the period 1980-2009. <lb/></body>

			<body>The author finds that the interaction between fiscal decentralisation and level of national GDP per capita <lb/>has a negative impact on regional disparities, suggesting an important conditioning role of GDP per capita. <lb/>10. <lb/>Finally, Kyriacou et al. (2013) tests the hypothesis that the quality of government rather than the <lb/>level of development mediates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities. The <lb/>authors use an unbalanced panel of 24 OECD countries over the period 1984-2006, showing that <lb/>decentralisation reduces disparities in high government quality settings, but increases disparities in low <lb/>government quality settings. Thus, they conclude that the different response of high and low income <lb/>countries is driven by differences in the quality of the government. <lb/>11. <lb/>Although the empirical evidence seems to support the idea that fiscal decentralisation reduces <lb/>regional inequality, there is not much investigation into the channels that drive this result. The present <lb/>work addresses this issue by explicitly considering the channels through which spending is financed <lb/>(vertical fiscal imbalance) in a panel that covers also the time after the financial crisis. <lb/>2.3. Channels from decentralisation to disparities <lb/>12. <lb/>The present work argues that the crucial channel through which decentralisation affects regional <lb/>development and convergence is the incentive to increase own (tax) revenue. A balanced fiscal structure <lb/>implies that most of local spending is financed by own revenues, thus providing a strong incentive to create <lb/>and expand such revenue sources. Blöchliger and Pinero-Campos (2011) argue that equalisation transfers <lb/>reduce fiscal disparities in the short term, but may reduce development incentives in the long run. The <lb/>importance of a balanced fiscal structure is investigated also by Goerl and Seiferling (2014). They show <lb/>that decentralisation may reduce household income inequality but it needs to satisfy additional conditions, <lb/>among which a balanced distribution of expenditure and taxation at the local level. <lb/>13. <lb/>The source of financing of local spending makes a difference in terms of the incentive to raise the <lb/>tax base. While transfers are unrelated (or negatively related) to economic performance, own resources <lb/>depend on the regional economy. Thus local policy makers have a strong incentive to use available <lb/>resources and to put in place business-friendly policies. In the case of large transfers there is no need to <lb/>expand the tax base in order to provide services to citizens; in fact, any increase in the regional tax base is <lb/> &quot; appropriated &quot; by the central government. <lb/>14. <lb/>There are mainly two channels through which local governments can expand their tax base: <lb/> Competition: competing for resources – people, firms or financial resources – with other regions; <lb/> A better use of existing resources: activating an endogenous process of development, which <lb/>exploits sources of development, through the implementation of business-friendly regional <lb/>policies and the more efficient use of untapped sources of development – e.g. human capital, <lb/>local labour force, local amenities, etc. <lb/>15. <lb/>Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of these two channels. The first channel may lead to <lb/>either increasing or decreasing inequality, while the second channel would likely lead to regional <lb/>convergence. The importance of the second channel lies in the idea that lagging regions may have <lb/> &quot; inactive &quot; resources, so that policy can have a higher marginal impact in those regions than in the better-<lb/>performing ones, thus leading to a reduction in regional disparities (Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra, 2010). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)54 <lb/></body>

From fiscal autonomy to regional inequality <lb/>Note: The links between boxes represent unidirectional causal relationships, going from left to right. <lb/>16. <lb/>There is some evidence that spending decisions of SCGs may depend on the size of the vertical <lb/>fiscal imbalance. Data show a positive correlation between sub-central tax revenue and the share of SCG <lb/>spending on economic activities (see Figure A.1, in the appendix). Recent studies have shown that tax <lb/>decentralisation enhances local growth-enhancing investments (Fredriksen, 2013; Kappeler et al., 2013), <lb/>thus shifting local spending towards more investment in infrastructure and education. Improving the <lb/>transparency and efficiency of the regulatory framework is also important to attract investments from <lb/>outside the region and mobilise local resources. <lb/>3. Empirical set-up <lb/>17. <lb/>This section provides a discussion of the measurement issues encountered when considering <lb/>regional inequality and fiscal decentralisation. Next, some stylised facts about the level and trend of <lb/>regional inequality are provided. Finally, the econometric model is laid out. <lb/>3.1. Measurement issues: Indicators for regional inequality and fiscal decentralisation <lb/>3.1.1 Measuring regional inequality <lb/>18. <lb/>The analysis focuses on regions defined according to the OECD Territorial Level 2 (TL2) <lb/>typology (Box 1). The TL2 regional level represents a partition of the national territory, which is small <lb/>enough to investigate internal geographical differences, and, at the same time, sufficiently large to avoid <lb/>strong effects of cross-border commuting. OECD countries display large variations in terms of the number <lb/>of TL2 regions and their size, ranging from 2 regions in Ireland to 51 in the United States, and from an <lb/>average population of 0.7 million inhabitants in Norway to 12.8 million in Japan (Table 1). <lb/></body>

			<body>19. <lb/>Regional disparities – or regional inequality – are measured in terms of regional GDP per capita, <lb/>defined in terms of constant USD. Taking the value of GDP in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) <lb/>allows an international comparison of the level of GDP between regions belonging to different countries. 2 <lb/>20. <lb/>Regional GDP can be defined according to either the production or the income approach; it is not <lb/>possible to use the expenditure approach because of the absence of data on imports and exports between <lb/>regions. In practice, most countries use the production approach, but for non-market activities, such as <lb/>general government and the health industry, the income approach is used. Regional GDP includes the <lb/> &quot; gross product &quot; of the public administration as a whole, which consists of both sub-central and national <lb/>government bodies for the share allocated to the region (European Union, 2013). <lb/>21. <lb/>This definition implies that production or income is allocated to the region where the production <lb/>unit is located. As a consequence, commuting for work-related reasons may affect regional GDP per <lb/>capita, as people producing the GDP in one region may reside in another region, thus inflating the figures <lb/>of GDP per capita. The geographical unit of analysis (TL2 regions), however, is large enough to contain <lb/>most workers commuting within its borders. <lb/></body>

In Canada, where regional price <lb/>indices are available, accounting for regional differences in PPPs would reduce the level of regional <lb/>disparities by at least 15% (Albouy, 2005). <lb/></note>

			<body>Box 1. The OECD regional classification <lb/>In any analytical study conducted at the sub-national level, defining the territorial unit is of prime importance. The <lb/>OECD classification is based on two territorial levels. The higher level (Territorial Level 2 – TL2) consists of 335 &quot; large <lb/>regions &quot; , while the lower level (Territorial Level 3 – TL3) is composed of 1 679 &quot; small regions &quot; .

			<body>the impact of fiscal decentralisation on regional disparities as one policy may influence the other. For this <lb/>reason, and for comparability with the existing literature, regional GDP per capita is used for measuring <lb/>regional disparities. <lb/>23. <lb/>Once the geographical scope and the unit of measure are defined, a statistical indicator, which <lb/>synthesises the information on the distribution of regional GDPs needs to be chosen. The most common <lb/>indicator is the coefficient of variation (COV). It is a normalised version of the standard deviation, as <lb/>shown in the equation below, where í µí± is the number of regions, í µí± í µí± is per capita GDP of region i, and í µí¼ is <lb/>the unweighted mean of regional per capita GDPs. <lb/>í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± = <lb/>√ 1 <lb/>í µí± <lb/>∑ (í µí± í µí± − í µí¼) 2 <lb/>í µí± <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>í µí¼ <lb/>= <lb/>í µí¼ <lb/>í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí± <lb/>24. <lb/>The COV requires a distribution with (1) a mean different from zero and (2) that all values are <lb/>positive. Both conditions are met by the use of GDP per capita. The interpretation of the value is in terms <lb/>of percentages with respect to the mean value. For instance, COV=0.03 means that the dispersion of the <lb/>distribution of regional GDPs is 3% of the mean. <lb/>25. <lb/>The main advantage of this measure is that it is mean independent, so that it can be easily <lb/>compared across countries. For instance, the COV is independent of the level of GDP, so that countries <lb/>with a different level of GDP can be consistently compared. This is an advantage over other inequality <lb/>measures such as the GINI coefficient and the Theil index, which are affected by the size of the <lb/>distribution and the unit of measure. Furthermore, the COV satisfies the Pigou-Dalton principle (roughly, a <lb/>transfer from a richer to a poorer region should unambiguously reduce the degree of inequality). <lb/>26. <lb/>There are, however, two possible sources of concern, when using this indicator. Firstly it is not <lb/>invariant to the number of regions in the country, as it assumes values in the range [0, √í µí± − 1]; secondly, <lb/>it does not take into account the size of the regions, i.e. the disparity is not weighed for the share of the <lb/>population living in each region. <lb/>27. <lb/>Some authors (for instance, Lessmann (2006) and Ezcurra and Pascual (2008)) use a population <lb/>weighted version of the COV (wCOV) to control for the distribution of the population over the regions, so <lb/>that the index would reflect less the disparities arising from less populated regions. <lb/>í µí±¤í µí° ¶í µí±í µí± = <lb/>√∑ [(í µí± í µí± − í µí¼ í µí± ) <lb/>2 * í µí± í µí± ] <lb/>í µí± <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>í µí¼ í µí± <lb/>The right term under the square root, í µí± í µí± , represents the population share of region i with respect to the <lb/>national population, and í µí¼ í µí± represents the national mean per capita GDP. The population weight reduces <lb/>the importance of less populous regions, so that the index will show a low level of variation even though <lb/>some regions are much poorer than the rest, as long as their population is negligible with respect to the <lb/>country&apos;s population. <lb/>28. <lb/>This analysis is based on the unweighted COV. Apart from the highlighted benefits of using the <lb/>COV, there are other motives that justify this choice. First, if the analysis aims at measuring economic <lb/>development and regional disparities, there is no reason to give larger regions a higher weight. Second, <lb/>using population weights has the drawback of understating disparities between urban and rural regions, <lb/>where the latter are (by definition) less populated (Spiezia, 2003). And third, the empirical analysis is <lb/></body>

The plot shows substantial differences in the <lb/>level of the COV among countries and substantial differences also with respect to its evolution. 3 The plot <lb/>suggests that countries with a low COV in 1995 have seen their regional disparities increase in the 1995-<lb/>2011 period, while countries with a high COV in 1995 have experienced a reduction in regional disparities. <lb/>Figure 2.

Measuring fiscal decentralisation <lb/>30. <lb/>Fiscal decentralisation is a complex phenomenon, which comprises several dimensions (Box 2). <lb/>Measuring the degree of decentralisation of a country is an attempt to summarise in a numerical indicator <lb/>the vertical and horizontal fiscal relationships between different levels of government. It is important to <lb/>account for both the quantitative (as appears in the budgets of sub-national government) aspects of <lb/>decentralisation and the qualitative aspects, such as the actual autonomy and capacity to conduct public <lb/>policies. <lb/>31. <lb/>Of particular interest for the present work is the actual mix of revenue and expenditure <lb/>decentralisation. OECD countries all present a share of local spending that is larger than the share of local <lb/>revenues, leading to a so-called vertical fiscal imbalance. The theoretical framework presented in section 2 <lb/>highlights the importance of financing expenditure with own taxes in order to provide the incentive to <lb/>implement growth-enhancing policies. <lb/>3. <lb/>See the appendix for country details. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2. The challenge of measuring fiscal decentralisation <lb/>The common measure to assess fiscal decentralisation is the share of resources assigned to SCGs. Spending, <lb/>revenue or tax ratios drawn from the OECD National Accounts or OECD Revenue Statistics allow measuring one <lb/>aspect of the extent of sub-central fiscal powers. These ratios, however, only poorly measure the true fiscal discretion <lb/>that SCGs enjoy in practice. On the revenue side, central government may limit tax autonomy, i.e. the ability to set tax <lb/>bases and/or rates, while on the expenditure side, central government regulation may strongly influence SCG <lb/>spending, thereby reducing discretion in setting policy. In some countries, the transfer of financial responsibility hardly <lb/>reflects more than a change in accounting, as essential regulatory power remains at the central level. The traditional <lb/>decentralisation ratios are therefore often inadequate, which becomes apparent once they are used to test how fiscal <lb/>frameworks affect outcomes such as economic growth, efficiency in the provision of services or citizen&apos;s satisfaction. In <lb/>recent years, the OECD Fiscal Network has worked on new indicators, focusing on sub-central tax autonomy or on <lb/>sub-central spending power, to complement and improve decentralisation statistics (Kim, Lotz and Blöchliger, 2013). <lb/>Since intergovernmental fiscal frameworks have many dimensions and since it is difficult to judge ex ante, which <lb/>indicator best reflects the relationship between decentralisation and regional disparities, the various empirical analyses <lb/>presented in this paper use a wide array of indicators. The following four decentralisation indicators are used <lb/>alternatively and, in order to avoid multicollinearity, one by one (sequentially) in otherwise identical equations: <lb/> Spending decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central to general government spending); <lb/> Revenue decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central own revenue to general government revenue); <lb/> Tax revenue decentralisation (the ratio of sub-central tax revenue to general government tax revenue); <lb/> Tax autonomy (the ratio of taxes over which SCGs have some base or rate-setting autonomy to general <lb/>government tax revenue), taken from the OECD Fiscal Decentralisation database. <lb/>One additional indicators is used: <lb/> Fiscal authority, an indicator which accounts for the degree of authority of local governments in setting rates <lb/>and bases of local taxes. The indicator assumes values from 0 (no authority) to 5 (high authority). This <lb/>indicator is part of a set of regional authority indexes (RAI) aimed at measuring the political, administrative, <lb/>and fiscal authority of sub-national governments. <lb/>Despite this agnostic view about the relevance and reliability of the various indicators, there is a priori evidence <lb/>that some of them are better than others in reflecting true sub-central fiscal policy autonomy. Revenue shares appear <lb/>to better reflect fiscal and regulatory power than spending shares, because sub-central spending is often financed by <lb/>large transfers with many regulatory strings attached. Institutional indicators that encompass several dimensions of <lb/>policy making are probably best in providing insights into SCGs&apos; actual power. Since institutional indicators provide a <lb/>richer picture of the policy framework than simple spending and revenue ratios, they provide a better basis for specific <lb/>policy guidance. Examples for institutional indicators are the Fiscal Network&apos;s tax autonomy indicators or the spending <lb/>power indicators, the latter being available for a few countries only and the fiscal authority index produced within the <lb/>regional authority project (RAI). <lb/>Source: Blöchliger, H. (2013), &quot;Decentralisation and Economic Growth -Part 1: How Fiscal Federalism Affects Long-Term <lb/>Development&quot;, <lb/>OECD <lb/>Working <lb/>Papers <lb/>on <lb/>Fiscal <lb/>Federalism, <lb/>No. <lb/>14, <lb/>OECD <lb/>Publishing, <lb/>Paris. <lb/>DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k4559gx1q8r-en <lb/>32. <lb/>For these reasons, not one but several indicators of fiscal decentralisation are considered. The <lb/>most reliable indicator for the empirical analysis are the OECD indicators of tax, revenue and expenditure <lb/>decentralisation, all expressed as share of local with respect to total values (Box 2). The indicator <lb/>measuring the vertical fiscal imbalance is determined as 1 minus the ratio between local revenues and local <lb/>expenditure. Although these (quantitative) indicators may overestimate the actual level of fiscal <lb/>decentralisation, they are used in the present study (as well as in most of the academic works), because <lb/>they are available for most OECD countries over more than twenty years. In order to check for this <lb/>shortcoming of the quantitative indicators, two measure of the actual degree of autonomy are considered: <lb/>the OECD tax autonomy indicator and the fiscal authority index produced within the Regional Authority <lb/>project (Hooghe et al., 2015). <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2. Some stylised facts <lb/>3.2.1. Regional inequality <lb/>33. <lb/>Regional disparities have slowly risen over the past 15 years. Across the OECD the differences in <lb/>sub-central GDP per capita, as measured by the coefficient of variation, rose from 0.26 to 0.28 between <lb/>1996 and 2013. Most strikingly, rising disparities within OECD countries were accompanied by an even <lb/>more pronounced decline in disparities between these countries. Put in other words, countries are <lb/>converging, while regions are diverging. Only recently have inter-regional disparities begun to shrink <lb/>again. <lb/>Figure 3. Regional inequality is decreasing between but increasing within countries <lb/>Note: The indicator OECD within is the coefficient of variation of regional GDP per capita within each country, averaged over the <lb/>OECD countries available in our sample; the indicator OECD between is the coefficient of variation of national GDP per capita <lb/>between those countries. The sample includes 26 OECD countries; among the current member countries the following are excluded: <lb/>Luxembourg and Estonia because of the presence of only one TL2 region; Iceland, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey <lb/>for lack of regional data for the whole period considered. <lb/>Source: Calculations based on data from OECD National Accounts and OECD (2016), &quot;Regional economy&quot;, OECD Regional <lb/>Statistics (database), DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/region-data-en. <lb/>34. <lb/>A similar trend of increasing within country regional disparity emerges also with the use of other <lb/>indicators of variation. As mentioned in section 3.1, the Theil index is not suitable for cross-country <lb/>comparisons because it is subject to changes when the composition of the sample, i.e. number of regions, <lb/>changes. However, it has the advantage of being decomposable into the within and between components of <lb/>inequality. This allows assessing how much of the inequality in regional per capita GDP is due to <lb/>differences between countries and how much to differences within countries. <lb/>35. <lb/>Table 2 shows an increase in regional inequality from 0.102 points in 1995 to 0.148 in 2011. The <lb/>decomposition of the index shows that the component of regional inequality explained by within country <lb/>disparities has increased from 42.16% in 1995 to a peak of 53.91 in 2007 – thus showing an increasing <lb/>trend before the global financial crisis – and declining to around 48% by 2011. Garcilazo and Oliveira <lb/>Martins (2013) find a similar trend using the Gini coefficient as the measure of national and regional <lb/>disparities, for the period 1995-2005. In particular, they observe a reduction of the Gini index between <lb/>OECD countries, and an increase of the Gini index of regional GDP within countries. Despite the general <lb/>ECO/WKP(2016)54 <lb/></body>

Fiscal decentralisation and regional inequality <lb/>37. <lb/>The theoretical framework developed in section 2 indicates that one of the main channels through <lb/>which fiscal decentralisation affects regional inequality is the incentive that tax decentralisation provides to <lb/>improve the competitiveness of the region, by competing for external resources and by activating internal <lb/>resources. A preliminary analysis of the data confirms this thesis. Figure 6 presents two plots in which <lb/>regional inequality is related to tax autonomy (left panel) and to the vertical fiscal imbalance (in the right <lb/>panel). The bi-variate association between regional inequality and tax autonomy is indeed negative, <lb/>confirming the hypothesis that more budgetary responsibilities are associated with less regional inequality. <lb/>Similarly, the bi-variate relationship between regional inequality and the fiscal vertical imbalance supports <lb/>the thesis that local spending not financed by own taxation leads to increasing regional disparities. <lb/></body>

The econometric model and the data <lb/>39. <lb/>The empirical analysis is conducted on an unbalanced panel of 30 OECD countries over the <lb/>period 1995-2011. The time period is constrained by the availability of regional data on per capita GDP. <lb/>The period considered, however, spans over more than 15 years allowing for a sufficient time variation to <lb/>capture changes in regional disparities and economic phenomena, such as the great moderation era and the <lb/>following global financial crisis. The dependent variable is the coefficient of variation of regional GDP per <lb/>capita expressed in constant PPP USD. The explanatory variables consist of a set of fiscal decentralisation <lb/>indicators, and a set of control variables that reflect country&apos;s characteristics supposed to affect regional <lb/>disparities. The estimations also include country fixed effects to account for all unobserved factors that <lb/>may affect regional inequality other than the control variables, and time dummies to account for common <lb/>shocks, like the recent global financial crisis. <lb/>40. <lb/>The econometric model consists of variables at the country level. Regional statistics are only <lb/>used to construct an indicator of regional disparities for each country and every year. The following <lb/>equation was estimated, where the subscript i indicates the country, and t refers to the year, <lb/>í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí»¼ + βí µí°¹í µí°· í µí±í µí±¡ + γí µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí± + í µí»¿ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ <lb/>FD corresponds to the different measures of decentralisation. In some regressions two measures of <lb/>decentralisation are considered at the same time, but in general measures of decentralisation are considered <lb/>one at a time, to avoid problems of multicollinearity. 4 The matrix X represents a set of control variables <lb/>which includes socioeconomic variables, territorial indicators, and public finance indicators. <lb/>4. <lb/>Table A.1 in the appendix presents the matrix of bi-lateral correlations between the variables. It shows that <lb/>the correlation between the fiscal decentralisation indicators is quite high. By contrast, the correlation <lb/>between the other explanatory variables is not large. <lb/></body>

			<body>41. <lb/>Fiscal decentralisation is measured by three budgetary indicators, the tax, revenue, and <lb/>expenditure share, and two indicators of fiscal power, the tax autonomy indicator and the Regional <lb/>Authority Index (Box 2). As expected the variation between countries is higher than the variation within <lb/>the same country, but there is still some variation within the same country. Table 3 presents the descriptive <lb/>statistics of the coefficient of variation, the local tax share, the local expenditure share and the local <lb/>revenue share, which show the standard deviation across countries (between) and over time in each country <lb/>(within). <lb/>Table 3.

The column <lb/> &quot; observations &quot; provides information on the total number of country-time observations N, the number of countries n, and the number of <lb/>periods T (this figure is not an integer because the panel in unbalanced). <lb/>42. <lb/>The set of control variables includes the level of GDP per capita and its squared value, supposing <lb/>the level of regional disparity follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with the level of development. <lb/>Spatial inequality has been associated to the process of economic development by Williamson (1965), <lb/>which applied Kutznets&apos;s income relationship to geographical inequality. Accordingly, the level of <lb/>regional disparity should rise in the first phase of development, because shocks and some natural factors of <lb/>production are geographically located, and then the diffusion of the development process should reduce <lb/>inequality following an inverted U-relationship. <lb/>43. <lb/>Other economic variables that can affect regional disparities are human and physical capital <lb/>investment, testing the hypothesis of a negative relationship between the national level of human and <lb/>physical capital and regional disparities. The share of national valued added in the manufacturing sector is <lb/>also included, as activities linked to the manufacturing sector are less concentrated in metropolitan areas <lb/>than the service sectors. Therefore an economy with a high share of manufacturing is expected to display <lb/>lower regional disparities than an economy mainly based on services. The New Economic Geography <lb/>literature emphasises the role of trade and globalisation for economic development and regional industrial <lb/>specialisation (Fujita et al., 1999). Scholars in this field maintain that opening national markets puts <lb/>regions in direct competition with foreign regions, thus allowing access to more markets. In view of these <lb/>considerations trade openness measured as the sum of exports and imports divided by national GDP is <lb/>included. <lb/></body>

			<body>44. <lb/>Territorial variables can also affect regional inequality. The distribution of people and firms over <lb/>the national territory may determine the emergence of agglomeration economies in some areas. The <lb/>concentration of people and firms is beneficial to economic development as it increases productivity, <lb/>although the impact on regional disparities is ambiguous (OECD, 2014). If economic activities are <lb/>concentrated in a few regions, the gap with other regions would tend to increase. By contrast, within each <lb/>region the concentration of factors of production in few locations may decrease regional disparities. In <lb/>order to account for agglomeration effects, two indicators are included in the analysis: the share of the <lb/>population living in urban areas, and the degree of geographical concentration of the population. The latter <lb/>index is of particular importance as it captures the total concentration of a country&apos;s population in each <lb/>region with respect to the regional surface area. <lb/>45. <lb/>Finally, an indicator of the size of the public sector is also considered. Countries with a larger <lb/>public sector may be better able to tackle regional disparities (Rodriguez-Pose and Ezcurra, 2010), <lb/>although it might also induce greater corruption (Tanzi, 1998), thus raising regional inequality. <lb/>46. <lb/>Table 4 presents summary statistics of the main control variables, while a full list of all the <lb/>explanatory variables is presented in Section A1 of Appendix A. <lb/>Table 4.

			<body>49. <lb/>The analysis considers the three main indicators of fiscal decentralisation separately in the first <lb/>three columns, expenditure decentralisation and the vertical fiscal imbalance together in column 4, and the <lb/>impact of the vertical fiscal imbalance in column 5. The estimation results show that both tax <lb/>decentralisation and revenue decentralisation reduce regional disparities, although only the tax share is <lb/>statistically significant. These results are in line with the theoretical framework, suggesting that the more <lb/>the SCG budget is funded by revenues coming from the local economy the higher the incentive to promote <lb/>regional growth. Moreover the question arises, whether revenue decentralisation benefits lagging regions <lb/>more than high income regions. Answering this question will be the focus of section 5.2. <lb/>50. <lb/>The evidence on the spending side shows that expenditure decentralisation and the vertical fiscal <lb/>imbalance have both a statistically significant and positive sign when estimated separately, but when taken <lb/>together they have no longer a significant impact on regional disparity. In fact, the estimation results of an <lb/>instrumental variable model (Table 8) shows that only the coefficient associated with the vertical fiscal <lb/>imbalance is statistically significant. This suggests that the vertical fiscal imbalance rather than expenditure <lb/>decentralisation affects regional disparities. Furthermore, weak 5 evidence is provided also by the <lb/>estimation of a model in which expenditure decentralisation and its interaction with the vertical fiscal <lb/>imbalance are considered (Table A3). The estimation results show that when the interaction term is <lb/>considered the coefficient associated with expenditure decentralisation is negative, but not statistically <lb/>significant, while the coefficient of the interaction term is positive and statistically significant. <lb/>51. <lb/>The control variables have the expected sign. 6 In particular, economic development, measured by <lb/>the country&apos;s GDP per capita and its square, displays a statistically significant concave relationship with <lb/>regional disparities. The coefficient associated with the level of GDP per capita is positive while the square <lb/>is negative, providing evidence for an increasing and concave relationship of regional disparities with the <lb/>economic development of a country. The coefficient associated with physical capital formation is negative <lb/>and significant, suggesting that investment (even aggregated at the country level) tends to reduce regional <lb/>disparities. Also the share of manufacturing value added significantly reduces regional disparities, as <lb/>manufacturing activities tend to be less geographically concentrated than those of the service sector. Trade <lb/>openness tends to increase disparities, but is not statistically significant in most cases. Population size <lb/>increases regional disparities, as it is a proxy for the size of the country and larger countries tend to display <lb/>wider regional disparities. By contrast, the more the population is geographically concentrated the lower <lb/>are regional disparities, suggesting a positive effect of agglomeration forces. Finally, the size of <lb/>government, measured by total government expenditure as a ratio of GDP, tends to increase regional <lb/>disparities. This is contrary to the widespread view that a bigger government (more public spending) <lb/>should reduce inequality between regions. <lb/>52. <lb/>The message stemming from the analysis is that the way decentralisation is achieved, matters for <lb/>regional disparities. For instance, an increase of 10 percentage points in the share of SCG revenues is <lb/>associated with a reduction of regional disparities by 4 basis points of the COV, or an 11% decrease if the <lb/>COV is evaluated at the mean value (0.36). Similarly a reduction of 10 percentage points of the fiscal <lb/>vertical imbalance is associated with a reduction of regional disparities by 1 basis point of the COV, or a <lb/>4% decrease. Clearly a reduction of the vertical fiscal imbalance can be achieved also in case of an <lb/>increase of sub-central spending, as long as it is matched by a greater increase in sub-central revenues. <lb/>5. <lb/>Those results are weak because the model is estimated without country and time fixed effects. <lb/>6. <lb/>Although not reported, a specification of the baseline model with the level of unemployment among the <lb/>control variables was also estimated. The associated coefficient, however, is never statistically significant <lb/>and does not change the estimated coefficients of the other explanatory variables. <lb/></body>

			<body>4.2. Extending the baseline model <lb/>53. <lb/>The results of the baseline model are confirmed by the inclusion of some indicators of the degree <lb/>of autonomy in taxation and the inclusion of specific taxes and expenditure functions. Table 5 presents the <lb/>results of the estimation of the baseline model with these indicators. The impact of fiscal autonomy on <lb/>regional inequality is negative and statistically significant. In particular, both measures of autonomy (fiscal <lb/>authority from the RAI dataset, and tax autonomy from the OECD Fiscal network dataset) confirm the <lb/>importance of local taxation for reducing regional inequality. <lb/>54. <lb/>This result suggests that providing local governments with fiscal autonomy does not increase <lb/>disparities, as suggested by part of the economic literature. It rather provides an incentive to increase the <lb/>tax base by attracting more firms and people and implementing business friendly policies. <lb/>55. <lb/>A finer distinction of the type of local tax does not add much to the analysis. Table 6 (column 3 <lb/>and 4) shows that both local income and property taxes reduce regional inequality, although not <lb/>statistically significant. Likewise, the distinction of local spending into social welfare spending and <lb/>education related spending does not provide any further insight. Table 6 (column 5 and 6) shows that the <lb/>coefficient associated with social welfare spending is positive as well as the coefficient associated with <lb/>education spending – the latter is not statistically significant, though. Overall the impact of national GDP <lb/>per capita (and its square value) on regional disparities is the same as in the baseline model, confirming the <lb/>inverted-U relationship. <lb/></body>

			<body>of Fiscal decentralisation in countries with different level of GDP; that is, the interaction term is not <lb/>significantly different from zero. This might be due to the focus on OECD countries, which reduces the <lb/>differences in terms of GDP per capita. <lb/>57. <lb/>In order to account for institutional quality the baseline model is extended with indicators which <lb/>capture different aspects of institutional quality.

The <lb/>indicators are supposed to capture the way in which public expenditure is managed at the local level. Three <lb/>indicators are considered: corruption, rule of law and government effectiveness. The first two indicators <lb/>capture the &quot; respect &quot; of citizens and public officials of the institutions and norms that govern economic <lb/>activities. The level of corruption is a main candidate for a negative impact of expenditure decentralisation <lb/>on regional inequality (Tanzi, 1996). Government effectiveness is supposed to capture the quality of public <lb/>services. A composite indicator of institutional quality (quality) is constructed by taking the arithmetic <lb/>mean of the three indicators. <lb/>58. <lb/>Table 7 shows that the most important indicator is corruption, which tends to increase regional <lb/>disparities. The other institutional variables as well as the respective interaction terms are not significant. <lb/>Interestingly, when corruption is included in the analysis the coefficient of expenditure decentralisation <lb/>becomes negative, although no longer statistical significant. Overall, the non-significance of most of the <lb/>indicators of government quality suggests that the impact of fiscal decentralisation on regional inequality is <lb/>largely independent of the quality of the government in OECD countries. The low statistical significance of <lb/>the estimated coefficient can also be due to one of the major caveats of using these perception-based <lb/>indicators: the lack of consistency over time, due to the change in the composition of the indicators <lb/>(Furceri and Mourougane, 2010). <lb/>Table 7.

			<body>4.3. Robustness checks <lb/>59. <lb/>The results of the analysis might suffer from a problem of reverse causality. The econometric <lb/>model assumes that the level of decentralisation within a country affects the level of regional disparities. <lb/>However, it could be argued that disparities may trigger a process of decentralisation, as persistent <lb/>inequality between regions may lead to political movements that advocate more independence. In order to <lb/>test for endogeneity, the previous econometric analysis is replicated using an instrumental variable <lb/>approach, where the lagged values of the fiscal decentralisation indicators are used as instruments. The <lb/>idea is that current levels of regional inequality should not affect past levels of decentralisation, so that the <lb/>correlation found in the analysis should go from decentralisation to regional inequality. <lb/>60. <lb/>The estimation results shown in Table 8 confirm the main results of the baseline model. All <lb/>coefficients maintain the same sign and statistical significance is actually increased for most of the <lb/>coefficients.

			<body>concern, however, is partly accounted for by the nature of the fixed effect estimator. The estimated <lb/>coefficient is not just the result of a cross-country comparison, but mainly of within country (i.e., over <lb/>time) comparison. In this sense, the estimated coefficients reflect also the change over time of the <lb/>variables, thus suggesting that, regardless of the initial level of regional disparities, an increase of the <lb/>vertical fiscal imbalance does increase regional disparities. Nevertheless, as a further robustness check, the <lb/>impact of regional disparities on transfers is estimated – i.e., transfers are treated as the dependent variable, <lb/>while regional disparities are included among the explanatory variables. This regression analysis shows <lb/>that regional disparities have no statistically significant impact on transfers, thus supporting the hypothesis <lb/>that the vertical fiscal imbalance does increase regional disparities. 8 <lb/>62. <lb/>The estimation results are also robust to a different indicator of economic performance, GDP per <lb/>worker. This indicator captures labour productivity and better reflects the economic potential of the region. <lb/>Productivity was not used in the baseline model because data are available for a limited number of years <lb/>and countries. The estimation results show that revenue decentralisation reduces between region <lb/>differences in labour productivity. <lb/>63. <lb/>The results of the baseline model may be affected by the particular time period considered (1995-<lb/>2011). This period is characterised by an initial phase of generalised economic expansion which <lb/>culminated with the outburst of the global financial crisis in 2007, leading to the subsequent period of <lb/>recession and subdued recovery. In order to control for this possible bias, the econometric model is <lb/>estimated over two sub-periods: pre-crisis (1995-2008) and post-crisis (2008-2011). The estimation results <lb/>provide similar figures for the two sub-periods, suggesting that the crisis hardly changed the link between <lb/>fiscal decentralisation and regional disparities (results are available upon request). <lb/>64. <lb/>Regional disparities display some degree of persistence over time. This may create some <lb/>problems of autocorrelation. In order to assess this problem, the Woolridge test for autocorrelation in panel <lb/>data was conducted (Woolridge, 2002). It shows that there is not a big problem as the null hypothesis of <lb/>absence of autocorrelation can be accepted at the 5% significant level. Nevertheless, a dynamic <lb/>specification of the baseline model is estimated, where the one year lag of the dependent variable is <lb/>included among the explanatory variables. The estimation strategy is based on the corrected Least Square <lb/>Dummy Variable (LSDVC) estimator proposed by Bruno (2005). This estimator can be used in the <lb/>presence of an unbalanced panel with a small number of individuals (i.e. countries in this case). The <lb/>estimation results confirm the baseline model. Although most of the variables lose significance, which is <lb/>captured by the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable, the coefficient associated with revenue <lb/>decentralisation is still negative and significant at the 10% level (Table A.5 in the appendix). <lb/>65. <lb/>A single country, which experienced a large change in either fiscal decentralisation or regional <lb/>disparity or both, may drive the estimation results. In order to rule out this possibility, the estimation of the <lb/>baseline model has been conducted with the exclusion of one country at a time. The baseline results were <lb/>confirmed. <lb/>66. <lb/>Finally, the estimation results could be affected by the type of indicator used to measure regional <lb/>disparity. As argued in the text, the coefficient of variation is the most common indicator used in this type <lb/>of analysis. As a robustness check, the Gini index of within countries disparities is used as the dependent <lb/>variable. The estimation results reported in Table A.4 in the appendix confirm the results of the baseline <lb/>model, suggesting that the results are not driven by the choice of the statistical indicator summarising the <lb/>distribution of regional output. Furthermore, the baseline model is also estimated using the weighted <lb/>coefficient of variation as measure of regional disparity – i.e., the coefficient of variation is calculated <lb/>8. <lb/>Detailed estimation results are available upon request. <lb/></body>

The main results remain valid. <lb/>5. Further analysis <lb/>67. <lb/>The analysis so far has shown the importance of tax decentralisation and a balanced fiscal <lb/>structure for regional convergence but did not focus on whether the reduction of inequality is due to a <lb/>catching up process which sees relatively poorer regions improving their economic situation, or because of <lb/>the decline of relatively rich regions. In order to shed light on this issue, the empirical analysis is replicated <lb/>using as dependent variable various percentile ratios. Furthermore, a growth regression is conducted on <lb/>various percentile ratios of the distribution of regional per capita GDP, in order to assess whether the <lb/>impact of decentralisation is stronger in richer or poorer regions. <lb/>5.1.

			<body>the reduction of disparities can be the result of a catching up process or a relative decline in the <lb/>performance of the top regions. An example of the latter phenomenon is provided by countries badly <lb/>affected by the global financial crisis and the subsequent great recession (like Greece), where the reduction <lb/>of regional disparities is probably driven by the drop in GDP experienced by the capital region. <lb/>5.2. Catching-up or slowing down? <lb/>71. <lb/>The empirical analysis conducted so far suggests that revenue decentralisation reduces regional <lb/>disparities. It is still not clear, however, what part of the regional distribution is most affected by <lb/>decentralisation, and in which way. A reduction of regional disparities is consistent with both a negative <lb/>performance of regions with the highest GDP per capita (top regions), or a positive performance of the <lb/>regions with the lowest GDP per capita (bottom regions). In both cases, within countries regional <lb/>disparities would decrease. <lb/>72. <lb/>In order to shed some light on this important issue, the analysis shifts from regional disparities to <lb/>regional convergence. In order to assess whether within country convergence comes from the catching up <lb/>of low income regions or from the bad performance of income rich regions, a separate sample of rich and <lb/>poor regions is constructed. These two samples are constructed by taking the regional GDP per capita level <lb/>of the top and bottom 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional outcome within each country. In other <lb/>words, the original dataset is split into a sub-sample consisting of the top performing regions within each <lb/>country and a sub-sample of the lagging regions within each country. <lb/>73. <lb/>The empirical strategy consists in estimating the impact of fiscal decentralisation on the <lb/>economic growth of the two sets of regions, separately. The econometric model is represented by the <lb/>following equation: <lb/>ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ − ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 = í µí± + í µí»½ 1 í µí°¹í µí°· í µí±(í µí±¡−1) + í µí»½ 2 ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 + í µí»½ 3 í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¼ í µí± + í µí»¾ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ <lb/>where ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡ represents the natural log of per capita GDP of the top (bottom) 25 th percentile in country i at <lb/>time t; í µí°¹í µí°· í µí±í µí±¡ represents fiscal decentralisation indicators for country i at time t-1; í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ is a set of control <lb/>variables – similar to the baseline model; í µí»¼ í µí± and í µí»¾ í µí±¡ represent country and time fixed effects; í µí¼ í µí±í µí±¡ is the error <lb/>term. <lb/>74. <lb/>The left hand side of the econometric equation represents the growth rate of the top (bottom) per <lb/>capita GDP in each country for the period 1995-2011. This is supposed to be affected by the lagged value <lb/>of GDP per capita (ln í µí±¦ í µí±í µí±¡−1 ), and the lagged value of fiscal decentralisation measures. The coefficient í µí»½ 2 <lb/>accounts for the catching up hypothesis originated from Solow&apos;s growth model, that is low income <lb/>countries (regions in our case) should growth faster than high income ones. In the current empirical <lb/>specification this parameter accounts for between country convergence among the richest (poorest) regions <lb/>in each country. <lb/>75. <lb/>The focus of the analysis is on the estimation of í µí»½ 1 under the two distinct sets of regional GDP <lb/>levels. If the channels through which fiscal decentralisation reduces within countries regional disparity is <lb/>greater incentive for low income regions to use their resources, we would expect í µí»½ 1 to be larger for the <lb/>bottom 25 th percentile than for the top income regions. <lb/>76. <lb/>Since the econometric estimate includes the lagged value of GDP as explanatory variables, the <lb/>estimation of this model incurs a problem of serial correlation of the error term. For this reason GDP is <lb/>instrumented with its 2 and 3 year lagged values (Acemoglu et al., 2006). The instrumental variable two <lb/>stage least square (IV 2SLS) estimation results are reported in Table 10. <lb/></body>

			<body>77. <lb/>The estimation results show that the one year lagged value of subnational tax share positively <lb/>affects the growth rate of both set of regions; however, it is larger in magnitude and statistical significance <lb/>for the bottom regions. The coefficient of revenue decentralisation is never significant, while the <lb/>coefficient associated with sub-central fiscal authority is positive and highly significant only for the bottom <lb/>25 th percentile regions. <lb/>78. <lb/>As regards expenditure decentralisation, the estimated impact on the regional growth rate is <lb/>positive for both sets of regions. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients, however, reveals that the <lb/>positive impact on economic growth is larger in the high income regions than in the bottom ones. This <lb/>provides some evidence for a role of expenditure decentralisation in increasing regional disparities. <lb/>79. <lb/>In line with the theoretical framework (section 2), this result provides evidence that lagging <lb/>regions can benefit more than richer regions from tax decentralisation. The responsibility to raise tax <lb/>revenue in order to finance local spending provides a strong incentive to attract resources and activate local <lb/>ones. However, while the first channel (competing for resources) should work in the same way in top and <lb/>bottom income regions, the second channel (activating unused resources) is likely to produce a higher <lb/>marginal benefit in lagging regions where the scope for activating resources is larger. <lb/></body>

The dependent variable in models 1-4 is the growth rate <lb/>of the bottom 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP (gb); the dependent variable of the models 5-8 is the growth <lb/>rate of the top 25 th percentile of the distribution of regional per capita GDP (gt).

Differences in productivity seem to determine regional disparities <lb/>80. <lb/>Regional GDP per capita can be decomposed into three factors: GDP per worker; the <lb/>employment rate and the activity rate. This factor decomposition reveals that the main driver of differences <lb/>in regional GDP per capita is differences in productivity (Figure 8). Employment and activity rates are <lb/>much more evenly distributed, suggesting that productivity is the main determinant of differences in GDP <lb/>per capita (OECD, 2015). Exceptions to this pattern are Italy and Spain, where employment differs widely <lb/>across regions, and Japan, where the active population is concentrated in few jurisdictions. More work is <lb/>necessary to determine, how fiscal decentralisation affects each channel. <lb/></body>

Differences in productivity drive regional disparities <lb/>Coefficient of variation of each factor, contribution to total variation, 2010 <lb/>Note: The variation of regional GDP per capita is decomposed into the contributions of labour productivity (GDP per worker), labour <lb/>resource utilisation (those employed as a share of the active working population) and the activity rate (per cent of the active working <lb/>population in total population). Since the relationship between GDP and its components is multiplicative, the variability of each <lb/>component does not exactly add up to the variability of GDP per capita. <lb/>Source: <lb/>Estimates <lb/>based <lb/>on <lb/>OECD <lb/>(2016), <lb/>&quot;Regional <lb/>economy&quot;, <lb/>OECD <lb/>Regional <lb/>Statistics <lb/>(database) <lb/>DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/region-data-en. <lb/></body>

			<body>APPENDIX A <lb/>A1. List of independent variables <lb/>Fiscal decentralisation indicators <lb/>SCG tax share: Ratio of sub-central government tax revenue in total tax revenue (Source: Fiscal <lb/>Decentralisation database). <lb/>SCG revenue share: Ratio of sub-central government revenues (including taxes) in total revenues (Source: <lb/>Fiscal Decentralisation database). <lb/>SCG expenditure share: Ratio of sub-central government spending over total spending of the public sector <lb/>(Source: Fiscal Decentralisation database). <lb/>Vertical fiscal imbalance: Indicator calculated as (1 − <lb/>í µí±í µí° ¶í µí°º í µí±í µí°¸í µí± <lb/>í µí±í µí° ¶í µí°º í µí°¸í µí±í µí± <lb/>), where SCG REV represents the amount of <lb/>revenues at the sub-central level, and SCG EXP represents the amount of spending at the sub-central level <lb/>(Source: Fiscal Decentralisation database). <lb/>Tax autonomy: Ratio of tax revenue over which SCGs have some autonomy in setting the base and/or rate <lb/>over total tax revenue. Since observations are only available for 1995, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011, a panel <lb/>variable has been created by interpolation (Source: OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database). <lb/>Fiscal authority: Indicator of the regional authority in setting tax rates and bases independently from the <lb/>central government. It goes from 0 (no fiscal power) to 4 (regional government can set both the rate and <lb/>the base of at least one major tax). Data are from the Regional Authority Index database which aggregates <lb/>annual scores from 231 regional government/tiers in 65 countries for the period 1950-2010. The indicator <lb/>is for the national level, obtained by the aggregation of regional scores, weighted by the regional <lb/>population (Hooghe et al. 2015). <lb/>Local income tax ratio: Ratio of sub-central income tax revenue in total income tax revenue, covering 35 <lb/>OECD countries for the period 1990-2010 (Source: OECD Tax Revenue Statistics). <lb/>Property tax ratio: Ratio between the revenue from property taxation and the total tax revenue (Source: <lb/>OECD Tax Revenue Statistics). This indicator is included because in most OECD countries the property <lb/>tax is mainly a sub-central government tax, which although not always under the complete authority of the <lb/>sub-central government, it does contribute substantially to the local budget. <lb/>Local welfare spending, local education spending: Ratio of the sub-central spending to the total spending <lb/>in the respective COFOG spending area (Source: OECD COFOG Database (SNA 93)). Data cover 24 <lb/>OECD countries for the period 1995-2012. <lb/>Control variables <lb/>GDP per capita: National GDP per capita measured in constant PPP USD (base year 2005) (Source: <lb/>OECD National Accounts database) <lb/>Human capital: Indicator based on the average years of schooling by country (Source: OECD Analytical <lb/>Database). <lb/></body>

			<body>Gross capital formation: Annual gross capital formation as share of GDP (Source: World Bank WDI <lb/>database). <lb/>Trade openness: Sum of the value of exports and imports of goods and services divided by the country&apos;s <lb/>GDP (Source: OECD Analytical Database). <lb/>Share of VA in manufacturing: Value added in the manufacturing sector as share of national GDP (Source: <lb/>World Bank WDI database). <lb/>Urbanisation: Share of urban population over total population. Urban population refers to people living in <lb/>urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population <lb/>estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects (World Bank WDI <lb/>database). <lb/>Population concentration: See Section A2 below. <lb/>Public debt: Central government debt as a share of GDP (Source: World Bank WDI database). <lb/>Government expenditure: Consolidated government expenditure as a share of GDP (Source: OECD Fiscal <lb/>Decentralisation database) <lb/>A2. Geographic Concentration Index <lb/>81. <lb/>The index of geographic concentration of the population for a country with N regions is <lb/>calculated as the following expression: <lb/>∑ |í µí± í µí± − í µí± í µí± | <lb/>í µí± <lb/>í µí±=1 <lb/>2 <lb/>where p represents the population share of region i with respect to the country&apos;s population; a represents <lb/>the surface area of region i with respect to the total surface of the country. For each region the indicator <lb/>takes the absolute value of the difference between the two shares and sums over all regions. Data are from <lb/>the OECD Regions and Cities database. <lb/>82. <lb/>The indicator is based on the idea that an evenly (not concentrated) distribution of a country&apos;s <lb/>population over the territory is achieved when the regional share of population and surface area coincide. <lb/>In this case the index has value zero. By contrast, when the regional population share is larger than the <lb/>surface area, the indicator assumes values greater than zero. The numerator is divided by two as for any <lb/>region in which the population share is higher than the surface area share there must be a &quot; complementary &quot; <lb/>region with the exact opposite condition. <lb/>A3. Bi-variate correlation matrix among the variables used in the econometric model <lb/>83. <lb/>Table A.1 shows that the different indicators of fiscal decentralisation are correlated, thus <lb/>supporting the choice of presenting results in which they are used in isolation. The correlation matrix also <lb/>shows that the pair-wise correlations between the other explanatory variables are not large. <lb/></body>

Correlation between SCG tax share and SCG spending on economic affairs <lb/>87. <lb/>The importance of the financing channel for SCG spending is highlighted by the chart in <lb/>Figure A.1, where the SCG share of tax revenue is plotted against the SCG share of spending in economic <lb/>related affairs. <lb/>Figure A.1. Positive correlation between spending on economic affairs and SCG tax revenue share <lb/>1995-2011 <lb/>Note: Values are shares of local with respect to total taxes or spending. Each dot represents one country in a specific year. <lb/>Source: Own elaboration on data from OECD national accounts database and OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database, <lb/>http://www.oecd.org/tax/federalism/oecdfiscaldecentralisationdatabase.htm. <lb/>A7. Dynamic specification of the baseline model <lb/>88. <lb/>Table A.5 presents the results of the estimation of a dynamic model, where the lagged dependent <lb/>variable is included among the explanatory variables. This model specification takes into account that the <lb/>value of regional disparities is persistent over time, i.e. the value in a given year is mainly determined by <lb/>the value in the previous year. <lb/>89. <lb/>The results of the estimation show that the main variables of interest maintain the same sign <lb/>although they tend to lose statistical significance. This is because most of the yearly change (about 70%) is <lb/>explained by the lagged value of the same indicator. The only statistically significant coefficient is the <lb/>impact of revenue decentralisation, suggesting that the main impact on regional disparity is determined by <lb/>the decentralisation of revenue to the sub-national level. <lb/></body>
