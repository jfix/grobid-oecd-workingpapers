	<div type="abstract">This paper examines, in France, the relationship between imports – and trade more<lb/> generally – and employment. It builds on the burgeoning literature relating trade and<lb/> labour markets, taking into account theories of firm-level trade and previous empirical<lb/> work. The analysis in the paper draws on three data sources to establish a matched firm-<lb/>level data set covering trade, economic variables and employment for the time period<lb/> from 1995 to 2004. The data set covers manufacturing firms. The paper develops<lb/> estimates of the relationship between employment and trade activity at the firm level, first<lb/> on an aggregate basis and then at industry level. Additional assessments are made with<lb/> respect to the firms&apos; experience with changes in imports of finished goods and<lb/> intermediates. The conclusion sums up the results and relates these to previous work on<lb/> the relationship of trade and employment in France, pointing to some possible<lb/> explanations and areas for further research.<lb/> JEL classification: F16 (Trade and labour market interactions)<lb/></div>
