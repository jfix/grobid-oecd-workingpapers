The results indicate that there are certain roles and responsibilities assumed by the <lb/>public debt managers in this field, while the degree of involvement differs widely across <lb/>countries. We also observed that the debt management offices&apos; (DMOs) involvement is more <lb/>prominent in the management of government credit guarantees, while contingent liabilities <lb/>arising from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and government sponsored insurance <lb/>programmes appear to be outside the domain of public debt managers in most cases.

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Contingent liabilities are significant sources of fiscal risks. History has shown that if governments <lb/>do not effectively manage fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities and take necessary risk <lb/>management measures in a timely manner, they can be caught unprepared for their fiscal burden. <lb/>From a sovereign debt management perspective, effective management of fiscal risks arising <lb/>from contingent liabilities has long been a concern because realisation of these risks has direct <lb/>consequences on governments&apos; fiscal positions and thereby public debt managers&apos; debt and cash <lb/>management policies and operations. <lb/>Our research shows that governments have increased their use of guarantees and other types of <lb/>contingent liabilities since the global financial crisis; in fact, the use of such instruments was a key <lb/>element of policy response to the crisis. Areas where this increase is most evident are; financial sector <lb/>support; credit enhancement for infrastructure financing in traditional and PPP procurement models; <lb/>and SME financing. Thus, effective management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has become <lb/>more important for governments than in the past. <lb/>Against this background, this paper explores the role of public debt managers in managing <lb/>explicit contingent liabilities based on country practices. To this end, we considered responses to a <lb/>survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs 1 of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries <lb/>(Brazil and South Africa) conducted by the OECD&apos;s Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit <lb/>in October 2013. Additionally, the paper examines task force members -Turkey (Chair), Sweden, <lb/>Denmark, Iceland, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa -experiences (Annex A). <lb/>One key finding of this study shows that the degree of DMO involvement in this area varies <lb/>widely across countries, as well as by types of contingent liabilities, of Debt managers&apos; experiences <lb/>are also quite diverse, stemming mainly from weight variance of different sources of contingent <lb/>liabilities in task force countries, and from differences in their public financial management <lb/>frameworks. However, there are similarities among countries with respect to fiscal risk management <lb/>tools and methods employed for managing and mitigating risks of contingent liabilities, such as <lb/>guarantee issuance guidelines, budgetary limits, contingency reserve funds, parliamentary reporting, <lb/>etc. Study findings point to the more active involvement of DMOs in management of government <lb/>credit guarantees compared to other sources of contingent liabilities. <lb/>The study analyses country practices in three categories of contingent liabilities from the public <lb/>debt management (PDM) perspective: i) government credit guarantees, ii) contingent liabilities arising <lb/>from PPPs and iii) government sponsored insurance schemes. It provides insights and <lb/>recommendations to help DMOs enhance their management practices. In countries where DMOs do <lb/>not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal risk management in general and contingent liability <lb/></body>

			<body>management in particular, the following recommendations may be relevant for other government <lb/>units. <lb/>In the area of government credit guarantees, this research builds largely upon information <lb/>collected in responses to the OECD survey. The recommendations include conducting cost and risk <lb/>analysis before guarantee issuance, charging fees at levels covering at least the expected costs, clearly <lb/>defining and limiting the guarantees in time and scope in credit guarantee contracts, applying ceilings <lb/>to promote fiscal discipline, increasing governments&apos; ability to cover possible future losses and <lb/>monitoring the overall position through contingency reserve funds, and enhancing transparency by <lb/>sharing both quantitative and qualitative information. <lb/>This study suggests certain areas for more active involvement by public debt managers in the <lb/>management of contingent liabilities arising from PPPs. DMOs can collaborate with the central <lb/>budget authority and PPP units in data consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on PPP <lb/>contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting. The study highlights the need <lb/>for a central government unit analysing PPP guarantees to inform decision-making authorities on <lb/>associated costs and risks. At the portfolio level, central monitoring of contingent liabilities under PPP <lb/>contracts for ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability is considered essential where public debt managers <lb/>can be effectively involved. It is important to note that guarantee valuation is key for informing PPP <lb/>decision making, since guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and private partner. <lb/>Under the government sponsored insurance schemes category, the study focuses on explicit <lb/>contingent commitments by governments under such schemes. It recommends that clear legislative <lb/>frameworks should define the scope and nature of the role of government within insurance <lb/>programmes. Regular co-ordination and communication mechanisms between relevant agencies and <lb/>public debt managers over fiscal risks arising from the financial system are essential for effective <lb/>information sharing. <lb/></body>

			<body>PART 1. INTRODUCTION <lb/>1.1. <lb/>Background and purpose <lb/>OECD best practices in the area of contingent liability management from the perspective of debt <lb/>managers were formulated in 2005 with the study &quot; Explicit Contingent Liabilities in Debt <lb/>Management&apos;&apos; 2 (2005 Report). The 2005 report recommends centralisation of risk management of <lb/>government debt portfolio including contingent liabilities and suggests that public debt managers are <lb/>well positioned to assume this duty. The report characterises contingent liabilities as a latent form of <lb/>sovereign debt, and discusses that their management might call for involvement of public debt <lb/>managers. <lb/>During the 22 nd OECD Global Forum on Public Debt Management (24-25 January 2013, Paris), <lb/>where the 2005 Report was distributed as a background document, there was a discussion on the <lb/>policy framework for capturing, measuring and mitigating the fiscal risks arising from contingent <lb/>liabilities. Delegates agreed there was a need to carry out further studies on the role of public debt <lb/>managers in contingent liability management, focusing more on the implementation side to add to the <lb/>analytical framework provided by the 2005 report. Delegates also suggested that new work should <lb/>cover post crisis developments and PPP guarantees. <lb/>In October 2013, the OECD&apos;s Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a <lb/>survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries <lb/>(Brazil and South Africa.to which 33 countries (out of 36), replied. The survey included detailed <lb/>questions about management of explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. As the next step, a task <lb/>force was formed, consisting of seven countries -Turkey (Chair), Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Mexico, <lb/>Brazil and South Africa, to work with the OECD on this subject area, Task force members drafted <lb/>detailed and comprehensive reports (Annex A) on their contingent liability management structures <lb/>and operations. <lb/>Given this background, the aim of this paper is: <lb/>i) to explore the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management, drawing on the <lb/>information compiled through the OECD survey and the task force country contributions ii) provide <lb/>policy conclusions and recommendations for DMOs. The paper benefits from, and builds upon, the <lb/>2005 report&apos;s analytical framework. 3 <lb/>2 The 2005 Report was drafted by an ad hoc expert group of the OECD WPDM. Members of the expert group <lb/>were: Lars Hörngren, Swedish National Debt Office (SNDO), Sweden (chairman). Jan Holmberg, <lb/>State Treasury, Finland. Morten Kjaergaard, Government Debt Management, Danmarks Nationalbank, <lb/>Denmark. Wojciech Rzasiecki, Ministry of Finance, Poland. Jacek Skrzynski, Ministry of Finance, <lb/>Poland. Marek Szczerbak, Ministry of Finance, Poland. Magnus Thor, Swedish National Debt Office, <lb/>Sweden. <lb/></body>

			<body>1.2. <lb/>Types of contingent liabilities and the study&apos;s scope <lb/>Various definitions of the term &quot; contingent liability &quot; exist in fiscal management literature. The <lb/>OECD&apos;s Best Practices for Budget Transparency defines contingent liabilities as &quot; … liabilities whose <lb/>budgetary impact is dependent on future events which may or may not occur (2002: 13) &quot; . They are <lb/>defined as &quot; obligations whose timing and magnitude depend on the occurrence of some uncertain <lb/>future event outside the control of the government &quot; by Cebotari A. (2008: 5). There are also some <lb/>other definitions in accounting and statistical standard manuals. 4 A common feature of these <lb/>definitions is the existence of &quot; uncertainty &quot; over the obligation in question. Uncertainty differentiates <lb/>contingent liabilities from direct liabilities. Contingent liabilities become government obligations only <lb/>when triggered by a pre-defined event or condition, the occurrence of which is not certain. <lb/>In literature, contingent liabilities are divided into two main groups based on the notion of <lb/> &quot; obligation &quot; : 5 explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. Explicit contingent liabilities are contractual <lb/>government commitments to make certain payments if a particular event occurs. The basis of these <lb/>commitments can be contracts, laws, or clear policy statements. Governments issue explicit contingent <lb/>liabilities in order to subsidise certain activities, (e.g. housing production, exports, and student loans) <lb/>or to fill gaps in the markets that private solutions are deemed unable to cover (e.g. risks that are too <lb/>large for markets to bear). The most common examples of such liabilities are government credit <lb/>guarantees, explicit guarantee commitments under investment projects and government sponsored <lb/>insurance programmes. Implicit contingent liabilities are political or moral obligations of the <lb/>government to intervene, mostly in the event of a crisis or a natural disaster. Governments do not <lb/>recognise these liabilities until a particular event occurs. While the financial system constitutes the <lb/>most common source for these liabilities, it is quite common to see governments covering losses or <lb/>debt obligations of sub-national governments and public corporations. Implicit contingent liabilities <lb/>are difficult to assess, let alone manage in a consistent manner, precisely because of their implicit <lb/>nature. <lb/>This study adopts a central government viewpoint while setting a dividing line between the two <lb/>categories of contingent liabilities. Table 1 shows the categorisation of direct and contingent liabilities <lb/>of different levels of government and private sector as contingent liabilities of &quot; central government &quot; . <lb/>To give an example, direct debt obligations of local governments or public corporations are implicit <lb/>contingent liabilities of central government, as central government might have to cover these <lb/>obligations in case of failure of these public bodies. Likewise, central governments might assume in <lb/>times of crisis and disasters, non-guaranteed debt of private banks, large corporations or even <lb/>households. Table 1 also shows how wide the scope of implicit contingent liabilities is for central <lb/>government, as it can encompass all financial commitments of the public sector and theoretically even <lb/>that of the private sector. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">4 The definition in the System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 is as follows: &quot; A contingent liability is a <lb/>possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the <lb/>occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of <lb/>the entity. &quot; ESA 2010 defines contingent liabilities as; &quot; Contingent assets and contingent liabilities <lb/>are agreements whereby one party is obliged to provide a payment or series of payments to another <lb/>unit only where certain specific conditions prevail &quot; . <lb/>5 Lindwall P. (2013) provides other classifications of contingent liabilities based on magnitude/impact, <lb/>probability, government influence and measurability. <lb/></note>

In case the borrower fails to fulfil its obligations, the lender can turn to the <lb/>government as guarantor and claim payment of interest and/or principal. In this study, the term <lb/> &quot; government credit guarantee &quot; refers to all types of guarantees covering debt service obligations of <lb/>beneficiaries and, as such, includes government guarantees issued for bonds as well. 7,8 However, this <lb/>study categorised credit guarantees issued within the framework of PPP projects within a different <lb/>group to be discussed subsequently. In this conceptual framework, government credit guarantees <lb/>comprise: <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">6 Selected country practices presented in Annex A include information on the experiences of task force countries <lb/>with implicit contingent liabilities as well. <lb/>7 The term &quot; loan guarantees &quot; is also widely used in the literature. Please also note that the SNA 2008 attaches a <lb/>different meaning to the term &quot; credit guarantee &quot; referring to it as guarantees to disburse un-utilized <lb/>loan amounts. <lb/>8 The SNA 2008 categorises credit guarantees as standardised guarantees and one-off guarantees. Accordingly, <lb/> &quot; Standardised guarantees are composed of the sorts of guarantees that are issued in large numbers, <lb/>usually for fairly small amounts, along identical lines. There are three parties involved in these <lb/>arrangements, the debtor, the creditor and the guarantor. Either the debtor or creditor may contract <lb/>with the guarantor to repay the creditor if the debtor defaults. The classic examples are export credit <lb/>guarantees and student loan guarantees. &quot;  &quot; …one-off guarantees, consists of those where the loan or <lb/>the security is so particular that it is not possible for the degree of risk associated with the debt to be <lb/>calculated with any degree of accuracy. &quot; Standardised guarantees are to be distinguished from one-off <lb/>guarantees based on two criteria: a. They are characterised by often repeated transactions with similar <lb/>features and pooling of risks; b. Guarantors are able to estimate the average loss based on available <lb/>statistics by using a probability-weighted concept. One-off guarantees are, on the contrary, individual, <lb/>and guarantors are not able to make a reliable estimate of the risk of calls. &quot; <lb/></note>

			<body> individual guarantees issued for public institutions like public corporations or local <lb/>governments, public or private development banks; mostly for their investment financing <lb/>operations <lb/> programme guarantees provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on <lb/>housing loans, student loans, export and SME credits <lb/> guarantees extended to bonds issued by commercial banks <lb/> individual bond guarantees in countries where public institutions borrow from capital <lb/>markets. <lb/>The second group consists of contingent liabilities arising from projects realised under PPP <lb/>models. PPPs are long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner <lb/>whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks <lb/>(OECD, 2012). Here the coverage is the government liabilities in the PPPs, which are explicit and <lb/>contingent. In this context, PPP contingent liabilities include: <lb/> financial guarantees in the form of credit and refinancing guarantees <lb/> revenue guarantees <lb/> exchange rate guarantees <lb/> termination payment commitments <lb/> debt assumption commitments <lb/> sub-sovereign creditworthiness guarantees. <lb/>The third sub-group consists of government sponsored insurance programmes. Here, the <lb/>scope again is explicit commitments by central government, which are also contingent upon some <lb/>future events. Therefore, fully private insurance programmes are outside the scope of this study. <lb/>Government sponsored insurance programmes are: <lb/> deposit insurance programmes funded or explicitly supported by the government <lb/> other government insurance programmes such as disaster risk insurance and terrorism <lb/>insurance. <lb/>There are other sources of explicit contingent liabilities not covered by this study, such as legal <lb/>claims against government, uncalled capital commitments to international organisations or country <lb/>specific forms of government contractual liabilities carrying uncertainties. <lb/>Implicit contingent liabilities, on the other hand, are much wider in scope. As such, their <lb/>management requires an orchestrated effort among various institutions and players in the economy. <lb/>When realised however, their negative effects on the governments&apos; fiscal positions are more <lb/>significant than explicit contingent liabilities, as the recent global financial crisis has shown. Thus, it is <lb/>important for debt managers to have the necessary risk awareness about implicit contingent liabilities, <lb/>as well as other sources of fiscal risks. <lb/></body>

			<body>The present report is informed by results from the OECD Committee on Financial Markets <lb/>(CMF) workstream covering both explicit and implicit financial sector guarantees, although it takes <lb/>the specific and somewhat narrower perspective of a public debt and risk manager and focuses on <lb/>explicit contingent liabilities only. As part of this workstream, the CMF has numerous studies on the <lb/>benefits and costs of the extension of various financial safety net aspects, including on competition, <lb/>incentives and risk-taking and taxpayer liabilities (see e.g. OECD, 2011 and Schich and Kim, 2011). <lb/>1.3. <lb/>Global crisis and contingent liabilities <lb/>It has been more than eight years since the onset of the global financial crisis. Policy responses of <lb/>governments aimed at mitigating the negative effects of the crisis especially over financial markets <lb/>have resulted in sizable increases in government debt and further deteriorations in fiscal balances, 9 <lb/>Concern continues over the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis, impairing efforts to restore <lb/>confidence among investors, financial intermediaries and households; and putting downward pressure <lb/>on global economic growth. <lb/>Progress achieved in reducing fiscal imbalances in OECD countries has not been at sufficient <lb/>levels to contain the public debt burden. Figure 1 shows central government marketable gross debt for <lb/>different country groupings. Debt accumulation is higher in G7 countries affected most seriously by <lb/>the crisis, while there is also an important increase in the OECD area of approximately 30% during the <lb/>period 2007-2014. 10 <lb/>Figure 1.

However, the <lb/>prolongation of these explicit guarantee programmes in Europe and the US has raised discussions over <lb/>their possible negative impacts on the risk and pricing mechanisms in financial markets 11 . The <lb/>issuances of these government-backed bonds reached very high levels during 2009-2010 (Figure 2). <lb/>Figure 2.

Regulatory and restrictive measures taken to protect the <lb/>financial system have led to a decrease in the risk appetite and willingness of banks to provide <lb/>financing for infrastructure. The resulting financing gap has become an important issue for both <lb/>developed and developing countries. In this environment, government guarantees, mostly taking the <lb/>form of credit guarantees, have continued to be important tools of credit enhancement in infrastructure <lb/>finance. On the other hand, in the framework of the PPP model of procurement, governments have <lb/>increasingly resorted to the financial and other guarantees in order to increase the governments&apos; share <lb/>in project risks and thereby ensuring the projects&apos; &quot; bankability 12 &quot; . <lb/>The global crisis has posed significant troubles for the small and medium-sized enterprises <lb/>(SMEs) as well. Work by the OECD 13 reveals that access to finance and lending conditions <lb/>deteriorated for the SMEs after the crisis, especially during the period 2007-2010, generally <lb/>accompanied by modest or no growth in credit volumes.

			<body>governments designed new SME guarantee programmes generally in the form of credit guarantees <lb/>provided under special programmes or expanded the existing ones in order to boost SME financing in <lb/>the post-crisis environment 14 . There have been changes in the total amount of guarantee funds, the <lb/>share of the loans guaranteed or the number and types of eligible firms aimed at increasing the <lb/>government support. In addition, these programmes included some new elements or new instruments <lb/>over the traditional guarantee programmes (OECD, 2013). In general, the main objective of these <lb/>programmes has been to enhance the SMEs&apos; access to credit, especially to bank lending. <lb/>Figure 3 presents the increase in the level of contingent liabilities in the European context for the <lb/>period 2007-2014. The data illustrate that in both the Euro Area (EA19) and the EU as a whole <lb/>(EU28), there was significant increase in the stock of contingent liabilities in 2008 and 2009, before <lb/>the gradual decrease in 2010 and 2011. The peak in 2009 reflects the large exposures of the European <lb/>governments under the financial sector support programmes (in the form of guarantee schemes), and <lb/>the subsequent decrease is largely the result of decreased exposures in Germany, Ireland, the <lb/>Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Eurostat, 2015). <lb/>Figure 3.

The areas where this increase was the most evident were; <lb/>financial sector support, credit enhancement for infrastructure financing in traditional and PPP <lb/>procurement models and the SME finance.

			<body>PART 2. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS <lb/>IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT <lb/>The first section of this part presents the summary results of the OECD survey to provide readers <lb/>with an overview of public debt managers&apos; involvement in contingent liability management across <lb/>countries. This part then analyses three categories of contingent liabilities; government credit <lb/>guarantees, contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and government sponsored insurance programmes, <lb/>and includes discussions on these policy areas from a PDM perspective. <lb/>2.1. Summary of the OECD survey results <lb/>The OECD Bond Market and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a survey on the role of <lb/>public debt managers in contingent liability management in late 2013 among 34 OECD Countries and <lb/>2 non-OECD Countries (Brazil and South Africa). The survey questions were sent through e-mails to <lb/>the authorities of DMOs and 31 OECD and 2 non-OECD countries responded to the survey. <lb/>According to the survey results, out of the 33 DMOs, 22 indicated that they have some role in the <lb/>management of contingent liabilities. Figure 4 illustrates this result as a percentage. <lb/>Figure 4. The role of DMOs in contingent liability management <lb/>The survey also provided information on the involvement of DMOs in contingent liabilities by <lb/>the type of liabilities (Table 2). The results indicate that the government credit guarantees is the <lb/>category of contingent liabilities with which DMOs mostly engage. Programme guarantees -also <lb/>included within the category of credit guarantees in this paper – government sponsored insurance <lb/>programmes and the PPP guarantees are areas that a majority of DMOs participated in the survey do <lb/>not assume responsibilities at the management level. <lb/>Yes <lb/>67% <lb/>No <lb/>33% <lb/>Responses to the question: Do you have any role in the <lb/>management of contingent liabilities? <lb/></body>

For the other types of contingent liabilities, the number of DMOs carrying these three <lb/>functions is much less.

			<body>Figure 5. The effect of the global financial crisis on the role of DMOs <lb/>To summarise, the main findings of the OECD survey on the role of public debt managers in <lb/>contingent liability management are: <lb/> Around two-thirds of the DMOs responding to the survey have some role in contingent <lb/>liability management. <lb/> Government credit guarantees is the sub-category of contingent liabilities that the DMOs <lb/>most actively engage. <lb/> Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and the government sponsored insurance <lb/>programmes are the areas the public debt managers are not involved in management while a <lb/>relatively small number of DMOs perform functions of measurement, monitoring and <lb/>reporting in these areas as well. <lb/> From the perspective of public debt managers, the effect of the global financial crisis on their <lb/>contingent liability management practices was largely through their increasing role in the <lb/>financial sector support programmes initiated within the crisis environment. <lb/>In the following sections, policy frameworks of government credit guarantees, contingent <lb/>liabilities arising from PPPs and government insurance programmes will be discussed with their <lb/>implications for public debt managers. <lb/>2.2. Government credit guarantees <lb/>Government credit guarantees are the liabilities based on contracts through which the government <lb/>assumes the whole or part of the credit risk of a loan extended to or a bond issued by another party. In <lb/>this study, the term refers to the guarantees covering debt service obligations of the beneficiaries. <lb/>Government credit guarantees are the most widely used explicit contingent liabilities in many <lb/>countries and the results of the survey strongly supports this finding. Traditionally, this group <lb/>consisted mainly of the individual guarantees provided for public institutions like public corporations <lb/>or local governments, and for public or private development banks, mostly in the framework of their <lb/>investment financing operations. In many developing countries, access to foreign financing sources by <lb/>public institutions has been possible through the government guarantees provided on their foreign <lb/>Change* <lb/>57% <lb/>No change <lb/>43% <lb/>Responses to the question: Has there been any change in your <lb/>role after the global financial crisis? <lb/></body>

			<body>loans. The alternative to these government guarantees is the on-lending, in which case, the government <lb/>borrows directly from the lenders and on-lends the funds under the same or different terms to the <lb/>beneficiary institutions by means of a separate agreement 15 . <lb/>Programme or umbrella guarantees – labelled as programme loan guarantees in the survey-are <lb/>usually provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on housing loans, student loans, <lb/>export credits and the credits for SMEs. These guarantees are also debt service guarantees issued by <lb/>the central governments. In most cases, programme guarantees are run by specialised agencies or <lb/>institutions, as in the case of credit guarantee funds for SMEs or export credit agencies (ECAs) for the <lb/>export credits. Considering the large number of beneficiaries involved, individual guarantee <lb/>applications are dealt with within the programme parameters at the agency level, rather than at the <lb/>central government level (such as the ministry of finance or treasury). <lb/>Guarantees issued by the governments for the bonds of the commercial banks in response to the <lb/>financial crisis can also be evaluated as some form of government credit guarantees. As these <lb/>guarantees were in the form of contractual guarantees, they are by definition explicit, irrespective of <lb/>whether they were issued on some (until then) implicit commitments. 16 . <lb/>From the government&apos;s perspective, motivation for credit guarantee issuance is a function of its <lb/>political and economic priorities and might change over time, depending on the developments in the <lb/>domestic market and at the global level. For example, when boosting real sector development becomes <lb/>a priority, guaranteed SME credits might be formulated, or in a financial crisis environment, bond <lb/>guarantees are brought to the table to ease the banking sector distress. The main objective of the <lb/>government in using credit guarantees as a financial instrument is, in general terms, to provide <lb/>incentives for the market to finance certain institutions, activities or projects. By taking over the credit <lb/>risk of the borrower, access to more funding from the lenders or investors is assured or the terms of the <lb/>financing is ameliorated. Thus, the principal rationale is the same in different sub-categories of credit <lb/>guarantees. For credit guarantees to be economically justified, however, they must bring advantages <lb/>that outweigh these drawbacks. Each proposed guarantee (or programme) has to be evaluated on its <lb/>own merits, including a careful evaluation of alternative solutions. <lb/>Role of public debt managers <lb/>The results of the survey show that compared to other forms of contingent liabilities, the area of <lb/>government credit guarantees is the one with which debt managers are the most actively engaged. <lb/>Public debt managers are involved in different phases of guarantee issuance; from assessing the credit <lb/>guarantee proposals, to monitoring and managing the credit guarantee portfolios and programmes. The <lb/>survey responses also indicate that DMOs were responsible for the management of the financial sector <lb/>guarantee programmes, initiated in the European countries during the global financial crisis. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">15 The OECD (2005) provides a comparative analysis of credit guarantees and on-lending and concludes that <lb/>credit guarantees have two drawbacks relative to direct lending. First and foremost, guaranteed debt <lb/>has higher funding costs. For a guarantee to a government-owned entity or for a subsidised guarantee, <lb/>this additional cost is borne by the government. Second, guarantees may entail higher financial risks, <lb/>in particular if the borrower is able to set and implement its own financing policy. Such risks are <lb/>transferred to the government as guarantor. To counteract such behaviour, the guaranteed borrowers <lb/>must be subjected to monitoring, an activity which in itself is costly. The Annex A.2 on Denmark also <lb/>includes an analysis of credit guarantees versus on-lending. <lb/>16 Levy, A. and Schich, S (2010) and Grande G, et al. (2011) provide detailed analysis on the financial sector support <lb/>programs involving government guarantees to bank bonds. <lb/></note>

			<body>Assessment of credit guarantee proposals <lb/>In case of individual (non-programme) credit guarantees, the criteria to be met by the applying <lb/>institutions should be set clearly thereby the initial assessment for the guarantee eligibility becomes an <lb/>easy task. This can be done by the front or mid office of DMO, or the related department of <lb/>Treasury/Ministry of Finance, where the application is submitted, or the sponsoring ministry in more <lb/>decentralised jurisdictions. <lb/>More importantly, assessment of a credit guarantee at the application stage requires a further <lb/>quantitative analysis of the proposed guarantee at hand, revealing its potential costs and risks to the <lb/>government. Ideally, the net cost/net benefit should be quantified through a cost-benefit analysis of the <lb/>guarantee proposal though it is often difficult to quantify the benefits of a guarantee. In this regard, the <lb/>guarantee should be valued and priced ex ante based on its expected and actual (mostly administrative) <lb/>costs and risks, based on different contingent liability measures, with two initial purposes: <lb/> inform the political decision-making body about the costs and risks of the guarantee before a <lb/>decision is made for its issuance <lb/> determine the level of fee to be charged from the beneficiary. <lb/>Operationally, these two analyses can be done in one stage or in two separate stages. The <lb/>quantitative analysis should inform and supplement the eventually political decision to be taken by the <lb/>legislature, cabinet or the minister, depending on the legal framework in place in a country. This <lb/>information should also be provided in a way to enable the decision-maker to compare between the <lb/>credit guarantee with other instruments like direct lending or subsidies in terms of its costs. For <lb/>example, the risk assessment conducted by the State Guarantee Fund (SGF) of Iceland, which is the <lb/>body within the Government Debt Management division of Central Bank, is submitted to the <lb/>Parliament for the latter to decide if a financial subsidy should be provided instead of a guarantee. <lb/>Ultimately, the policymaking body decides whether to issue the guarantee or not. A guarantee can be <lb/>issued for political reasons or certain policy purposes even when the cost of a guarantee is relatively <lb/>high. <lb/>According to the results of the OECD Survey, there are differences among countries in decision-<lb/>making frameworks for issuing credit guarantees, but political decision-making supported by a <lb/>quantitative assessment/evaluation of guarantee terms exists in many countries (Table 4). <lb/></body>

The Ministry of Finance <lb/>presents the bill to the Parliament. <lb/>The SGF, a separate body within the Central <lb/>Bank Government Debt Management <lb/>Subdivision, conducts the necessary risk <lb/>assessment exercise. The opinion of the SGF is <lb/>a condition for sending the bill to the <lb/>Parliament. <lb/>Mexico <lb/>Minister of Finance decides whether <lb/>to authorise guarantees or not. <lb/>The DMO or the Ministry of Finance conducts <lb/>no quantitative analysis during the decision-<lb/>making. <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Ministry of Finance must approve all <lb/>guarantee proposals. <lb/>DSTA in consultation with the Central Bank is <lb/>the agency evaluating the guarantee <lb/>applications of banks, also calculating the fee <lb/>to be charged from these banks. <lb/>South Africa <lb/>Minister of Finance, or another <lb/>cabinet member with the concurrence <lb/>of the Minister of Finance, decides on <lb/>the issuance of guarantees. <lb/>Fiscal Liabilities Committee (FLC) chaired by <lb/>the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) <lb/>Division of Treasury evaluates the quantitative <lb/>analysis including the risk assessment <lb/>conducted by the ALM Division at each <lb/>application. <lb/>Sweden <lb/>The Parliament decides on the <lb/>purpose and the amount of the credit <lb/>guarantee. In case of the guarantee <lb/>programmes, single authorizations are <lb/>issued by the Parliament. <lb/>The responsible authority analyses the credit <lb/>risk of the undertaking, decide upon the terms <lb/>of the guarantee, and calculate a fee that will <lb/>cover the expected cost (or a higher fee to <lb/>comply with international agreements). <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Minister responsible from the <lb/>Treasury has the authority to issue <lb/>government credit guarantees, within <lb/>the nominal limits set by the <lb/>Parliament through the annual budget <lb/>law. <lb/>Credit Risk Management Department within <lb/>the Treasury informs the front office about the <lb/>credit rating category of the applicant based on <lb/>an internal model at each credit guarantee <lb/>application.

			<body>In some cases, debt managers are given the mandate to perform the quantitative analysis both at <lb/>the proposal assessment stage of the credit guarantees and for managing the portfolio (which will be <lb/>discussed later). Public debt managers tend to have a broad perspective on government finances, thus <lb/>they may be expected to make unbiased assessments of the costs and risks. Their general financial and <lb/>economic expertise may also be helpful in making the analyses necessary to determine an appropriate <lb/>fee. On the other hand, guarantee pricing requires capacity development in credit and project <lb/>evaluation, and financial statement analysis to calculate default probabilities of institutions. These <lb/>areas of expertise are not searched for in conventional debt management. Conducting default analysis <lb/>of different types of institutions; SOEs, local administrations, public banks, and private investment <lb/>banks, etc. might be challenging and requires a credit risk management function to be established <lb/>within the debt management offices. Hiring credit risk specialists (the SNDO in Sweden and SGF in <lb/>Iceland) or using a tailor-made credit rating model designed by credit risk management specialists <lb/>hired for this purpose (Turkish Treasury) might be considered as other solutions, which enable <lb/>tackling with these challenges. <lb/>In case of programme guarantees, which are usually authorised by the parliaments and involve <lb/>many borrowers, additional aspects should be considered. Common practice is that the governments <lb/>administer these guarantee programmes through specialised agencies and institutions – such as ECAs, <lb/>credit guarantee funds/corporations specialized in SME guarantees, housing funds or agencies <lb/>providing student loan guarantees -rather than assigning their management to DMOs. For efficient <lb/>public financial management, these programmes should have clearly stated objectives and a set of <lb/>rules for granting specific types of guarantees in order to provide the framework in which the unit <lb/>responsible for issuance of these guarantees operates. In countries where centralised risk management <lb/>function is performed by DMOs, the expected costs and risks of these guarantees should be taken into <lb/>account in their overall risk assessment. <lb/>Contract Design <lb/>Credit guarantee contracts should be formulated in such a way as to clearly identify the scope and <lb/>the terms of the guarantee. Governments limit the guarantees they issue, in time and amount for fiscal <lb/>risk management purposes. For example, &quot; The Guidelines of Borrowing and Risk Management &quot; of <lb/>Denmark stipulates that loan types must be customary, i.e. known and used in the market by reputed <lb/>borrowers and loans must be built up from simple elements that make them transparent (plain vanilla <lb/>products), to be eligible for guarantees &quot; . To give another example, in Swedish legal framework, it is <lb/>envisaged that any guarantee undertaking must include contractual terms that limit the state&apos;s risk and <lb/>ensures that the state has appropriate rights to monitor and control the risk. <lb/>Guarantee agreement between the lender and the government and the loan agreement between the <lb/>lender and the borrower institution are parts of the same financial package. There is usually a third <lb/>agreement (or protocol) between the government and the borrower regulating mostly the fee charging <lb/>and recovery issues. Being as such, the terms of these agreements are highly correlated including <lb/>cross-references to each other. The governments should play an active role in drafting the whole <lb/>package of agreements to ensure proper clauses are in place regarding issues such as: <lb/> collateral and counter-guarantee (if there are any) <lb/> guarantee fee and administrative costs to be charged from the borrower <lb/> rules and procedures to be followed when the guarantee is called <lb/> financial and information sharing obligations of the lender and the borrower towards the <lb/>government as the guarantor <lb/></body>

			<body> sanctions for noncompliance <lb/> case of default and the step-in conditions of the government as the guarantor <lb/> recovery (collection procedures of the government pay-outs), etc. <lb/>The level of involvement of debt managers in the contract design and negotiations depends on the <lb/>institutional framework for the issuance of credit guarantees. In countries where DMO has the <lb/>authority to issue the guarantees, it is naturally involved with the contract drafting, negotiation and <lb/>execution processes as the contracting party. However, in decentralized structures where the <lb/>institutions other than the debt management office/Treasury/Ministry of Finance have the authority to <lb/>issue guarantees such a direct involvement might not be the case. <lb/>Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio <lb/>Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio is a crucial function of governments meaning <lb/>in simple terms, taking necessary measures to monitor and mitigate the fiscal risks posed by the <lb/>already issued guarantees. The most common risk management tools employed by countries are: i) a <lb/>limit or ceiling over the guarantee issuance or stock ii) a contingency reserve fund iii) partial guarantee <lb/>issuance, iv) portfolio monitoring and v) disclosure and reporting. <lb/>Countries with strong capacity in managing risks of their direct debt portfolio are in a better <lb/>position to perform this function over their guaranteed debt portfolio. Well-structured DMOs may <lb/>expand their areas of responsibility to cover the risk management of contingent debt alongside the <lb/>direct debt, enabling an integrated portfolio approach to risk management. For example, the Irish Debt <lb/>Management Agency (NTMA) has evolved from a single function agency to the manager of a <lb/>complex portfolio of public assets and liabilities. Likewise, the New Zealand DMO has recently <lb/>assumed the role to monitor contingent liabilities as part of the responsibility of managing the Crown <lb/>Balance Sheet. In April 2013, the DMO acquired the Balance Sheet Monitoring unit within the New <lb/>Zealand Treasury, playing a more influential role in the management of contingent liabilities. <lb/>Across the countries applying limits, the types and scope change. Some countries apply an overall <lb/>limit for all the contingent liabilities or even direct debt and contingent debt together, while in some <lb/>others credit guarantees, guarantees issued under certain programmes (like bond guarantees for the <lb/>banks), under the PPP frameworks, etc. are subject to separate ceilings. The scope of the limit might <lb/>apply to the central government issuances or be extended to cover the general government. Some <lb/>examples of guarantee limits are given in Table 5. <lb/>Another issue is whether to limit the government&apos;s exposure to the credit risk of a single <lb/>institution, in order to confine the concentration risk of the portfolio. Within well-established <lb/>frameworks where the applications are filtered through a process in which the creditworthiness of the <lb/>applicant is measured and reflected on the guarantee fee, concentration risk might not be regarded as a <lb/>major concern. However, where the incentivising motives of the government is high, issuing large <lb/>amounts of guarantees to certain institutions continuously, even when there is an overall limit might <lb/>increase the risk on the government&apos;s side. <lb/>In jurisdictions where parliamentary approval is a rule for each guarantee issuance, limiting the <lb/>exposure might be less of a concern than in those where guarantee decisions are taken at the <lb/>ministerial, cabinet or separate authority level. <lb/>Limiting the credit risk exposure by limiting the duration of certain guarantee programmes <lb/>designed for exceptional circumstances is also recommended in order to avoid moral hazard and <lb/>prevent the government support through guarantees to be regarded as a normal way of business.

			<body>example, our survey results indicate that the government guaranteed bank bonds issued after the global <lb/>crisis were designed to be limited in time and amount. <lb/>When the guarantee limit is set and revised annually, the calculation of the limit to be applied for <lb/>the subsequent year should be based on the valuation of the existing guarantee portfolio and the <lb/>pipeline of new projects and activities together. Thus, limit-setting exercise could also be an area of <lb/>involvement for the debt managers, which might be regarded as a side work of guarantee valuation. <lb/>Table 5.

The budget law <lb/>specifies potential beneficiaries, maximum amount and deadline for the granting of the <lb/>guarantees. <lb/>Sweden <lb/>The government delegates the parliament&apos;s approvals to issue guarantees to the related <lb/>authorities annually under separate ceilings. <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Total amount of new issuances of credit guarantees and on-lending is subject to limits set <lb/>by the budget law of the fiscal year.

Country examples of reserve funds <lb/>Country <lb/>Reserve fund <lb/>South Africa <lb/>South Africa does not currently have a reserve fund, but one of the mandates of the FLC is to <lb/>consider the introduction of a funded contingency reserve account. <lb/>Sweden <lb/>Each responsible authority keeps a &quot; notional reserve account &quot; at the SNDO. There is an <lb/>unlimited credit linked to each reserve. A call on state guarantee is booked against the <lb/>applicable nominal reserve and the resulting payment is charged against the Treasury Single <lb/>Account. In addition, the fees and recoveries are recorded in these nominal accounts and then <lb/>transferred into the central government revenues to decrease the SNDO&apos;s borrowing <lb/>requirement. <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Turkish contingency reserve account (called &quot; risk account &quot; ) was established in 2003 at the <lb/>Central Bank with the purpose of funding needs arising from of the credit guarantees. It is an <lb/>actual and off-budgetary fund. The revenues of the fund consist of the collections from past <lb/>pay-outs, guarantee/on-lent fees and interest income. If these revenues do not meet the need <lb/>for undertakings, budgetary allocation for the risk account is utilised. <lb/>USA <lb/>Loan guarantees fund in USA is an example of notional reserve funds. It is an off-budget fund <lb/>where the beneficiaries or the sponsoring departments pay the fees for guarantees. The <lb/>transactions of these accounts are presented in budget documents. <lb/>Source: OECD 2013 Survey on the Role of Debt Managers in Contingent Liability Management, Cebotari (2009) <lb/>Issuance of partial credit guarantees, i.e. providing guarantee coverage for a percentage of the <lb/>debt service obligations of the beneficiary, is a useful tool to establish a risk sharing arrangement <lb/>between the government and the lender. Through leaving a certain portion of the loan or bond <lb/>uncovered, the government can ensure that lender or investor carry some credit risk as well. Another <lb/>tool to provide partiality is obliging the guarantee beneficiary to provide some part of the total <lb/>financing for the project/activity in question. <lb/>In Turkey, for example, Treasury repayment guarantees are provided for up to 95% of <lb/>repayments of the agreed credit amount. Partial guarantee does not apply to the loans from <lb/>international and regional organisations, foreign government funds, and export credits provided by the <lb/>official export insurance agencies of foreign countries; because of their concessional terms compared <lb/>with commercial loans. In Iceland, this ratio is limited to 75% of the credit amount. In addition, the <lb/>guarantee recipient is required to provide at least 20% of the total financing for the project. In Canada, <lb/>lender-risk sharing is ensured by leaving 15% of the default risk to the lenders. <lb/></body>

			<body>Centralisation of the risk management function requires close monitoring of the portfolio, which <lb/>is possible only by having access to information on the existing guarantees. Portfolio monitoring has <lb/>two legs in general: <lb/> monitoring of the disbursements and payments under the instrument on which the credit <lb/>guarantee is established, and <lb/> monitoring the financials of the beneficiary to be informed about its financial health in order <lb/>to assess its ability to service guaranteed debt <lb/>Regarding the first one, the survey results show that in many OECD countries DMO is the place <lb/>where data on existing guarantees are gathered even if it is not the issuer of some of those guarantees. <lb/>The debt manager might use the data collected for the following purposes: <lb/> valuation of the existing portfolio to assess fiscal risks that the central government is <lb/>exposed <lb/> informing the related bodies or parties (the Parliament, Cabinet, Finance Minister etc. ) about <lb/>such risks <lb/> using the guarantee information as an input in debt sustainability analysis (see section below) <lb/> publishing the information on the web-site <lb/> publishing the information as part of debt management reporting. <lb/>Institutional arrangements should be made in such a way as to make the data collection easier. In <lb/>South Africa, for example, the data on utilisation from the existing guarantees are collated by the <lb/>ALM Division (Credit Risk Directorate) of Treasury to be able to make overall risk based assessments <lb/>of the portfolio and to produce recommendations to the FLC on a quarterly basis. Establishing a <lb/>special guarantee-monitoring unit within DMO might also be useful. In Turkey, there is a separate <lb/>division within the Treasury back office to monitor the guarantee portfolio, while the credit risk <lb/>department in the middle office conducts the portfolio risk assessments. The flow of information to <lb/>this monitoring unit might be direct or indirect through the fiscal reporting, which must be provided by <lb/>the individual agencies to the Ministry of Finance. <lb/>Portfolio monitoring at the central level should ideally cover the whole portfolio of explicit <lb/>contingent liabilities in which the portfolio of credit guarantees constitutes the most prominent part in <lb/>most of the countries. <lb/>As regards to the disclosure and reporting, both quantitative and qualitative information on credit <lb/>guarantees should be disclosed based on their expected costs and in such a way as to give a complete <lb/>picture of the government&apos;s total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and <lb/>budgetary documentation. <lb/>Countries have different practices in credit guarantee disclosure and reporting, both as regards to <lb/>the content of the data they disclose and to the forms of disclosure (web reporting, budget document, <lb/>separate periodical report, etc.) (Table 7). <lb/></body>

All reports are publically available. <lb/>Turkey <lb/>The monthly &quot; Public Debt Management Report &quot; is prepared and published by the General <lb/>Directorate of Public Finance of Treasury. It contains data related to public debt management <lb/>including Treasury guarantees provided, Treasury guaranteed debt stock, undertaken amount <lb/>from these guarantees in addition to other statistical data on direct or contingent liabilities of <lb/>Treasury such as Risk Account transactions, grants, on-lending of external debts etc. The report <lb/>is updated monthly and is posted on the Treasury website (www.treasury.gov.tr). A descriptive <lb/>version of the report is published on annual basis. <lb/>Source: OECD 2013 Survey on the Role of Debt Managers in Contingent Liability Management <lb/>2.3. <lb/>Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs <lb/>The use of the PPP model of procurement for realizing public investment projects has a long <lb/>history as an alternative method to traditional public procurement. The PPP model is described by the <lb/>OECD Principles (2012) as &quot; …long term contractual arrangements between the government and a <lb/>private partner whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the <lb/>associated risks &quot; 17 . <lb/>Despite significant benefits offered by PPPs, most important one being the employment of private <lb/>sector&apos;s efficiency and resources for the purpose of delivering public services, there are yet many <lb/>challenges posed by this model. Most importantly, the complexity of the model necessitates skilful <lb/>management on the public side, which brings about certain capacity building issues. <lb/>The IMF warns that PPPs might entail significant fiscal risks, and draws attention to the actions <lb/>to help mitigate these fiscal risks. Strengthening the legal provisions affecting PPPs, strengthening the <lb/>management and oversight frameworks, achieving full and transparent disclosure of all fiscal risks and <lb/>fully integrating the accounting for and reporting of PPPs in the medium-term budget process are the <lb/>actions that the IMF recommends (IMF 2014). <lb/>Cash flows generated by PPPs are generally quite different from those under the traditional public <lb/>procurement. It might require less public money during the initial years of the contracts, as the <lb/>investment is usually financed by private equity and finance. This perception makes PPPs relatively <lb/>more attractive to governments, especially to ones with fiscal constraints. However, when the fiscal <lb/>costs of the public investment are analysed over the life of the project, the choice for a PPP might not <lb/>be justified. <lb/>While the rise in the interest for PPPs in recent years is evident, the available data suggests that <lb/>there have been considerable falls in the number of PPP deals in the aftermath of the crisis, especially <lb/>in Europe, as the access to long term private financing sources has become more difficult (Figure 7) 18 . <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">17 As also noted in the OECD Principles, there is no commonly agreed definition of the PPPs, different <lb/>definitions are used by different international institutions and countries. The fact that there are a <lb/>variety of models under the &quot; PPP &quot; category with specific ownership structures makes agreement over <lb/>a unified definition more difficult. <lb/>18 January 2010 Survey by the OECD, presented in &quot; How to Attain Value for Money &quot; <lb/></note>

			<body>The collapse of the monoline 19 industry due to the crisis, which was important in providing financial <lb/>guarantees over bonds issued by project companies to finance PPPs, and the new and more restrictive <lb/>Basel III capital requirements for banks; are some of the factors exacerbating the limitations of private <lb/>investment finance. <lb/>In recent years, direct and contingent commitments provided by the governments under the PPP <lb/>frameworks have been sought for more and more by the private sector companies and lenders. The <lb/>European Public Private Partnership Expertise Centre (EPEC) confirms this trend by noting &quot; Limited <lb/>liquidity in the PPP financing markets, increased risk aversion of lenders and sponsors and a higher <lb/>cost of capital have led governments to take a more active role in providing direct and indirect <lb/>financial support to PPP programmes. So far, government support has often been provided through <lb/>financing non-government partners&apos; capital costs, granting extensive guarantees to creditors as well as <lb/>agreeing to more generous PPP contract termination clauses &quot; (EPEC, 2010). However, as data <lb/>availability on the contingent commitments embedded in PPP contracts is very limited, it is not <lb/>possible to show this rising trend across countries 20,21 . It should also be noted that the current low <lb/>interest rate environment in the international financial markets is a factor boosting investors&apos; <lb/>willingness to finance PPPs, which might result in a reduced need for the government guarantees <lb/>aiming at credit enhancement in the coming years. <lb/>Figure 6.

			<body>Types of contingent liabilities in PPPs <lb/>For the purposes of this report, PPP contingent liabilities cover those contingent commitments, <lb/>which are based on contracts 22 signed by the central government institutions for PPPs. The non-<lb/>contractual or implicit PPP liabilities, which are materialized mostly when the politically important <lb/>projects are bailed out by the governments, or when the governments have to renegotiate PPP <lb/>contracts, are outside the scope of this report. <lb/>On the other hand, direct fiscal commitments of governments under the PPPs; like up-front <lb/>capital contributions or availability payments of governments committed during the life of the project <lb/>are not covered because these are not contingent but direct liabilities of the governments. However, it <lb/>is important to acknowledge that these long-term direct fiscal commitments are also important sources <lb/>of fiscal risk and should be monitored closely for ensuring fiscal sustainability. <lb/>Within this context, the main contingent liabilities under PPPs are: <lb/> credit and refinancing guarantees extended to the project companies under which the <lb/>government guarantees the lenders that it will service their debt if the PPP company fails to <lb/>do so. <lb/> revenue guarantees, where the government guarantees the project company a certain level of <lb/>usage of the services to be provided by the latter. <lb/> exchange rate guarantees, which means the government assumes the exchange risk of the <lb/>project company, usually when the project&apos;s main cash flows are denominated in a foreign <lb/>currency. <lb/> termination payments, which are government commitments to pay the project company a <lb/>certain amount in case the contract terminates prematurely, where the principle is that this <lb/>amount corresponds to the value of the project assets, but in some cases the government <lb/>commits to pay a certain portion of the debt outstanding to the lenders <lb/> debt assumption commitments, where the government agrees to assume the debt obligations <lb/>of the project company in case the PPP contract is terminated. Compared to the terminations <lb/>payments, the debt assumption commitments are towards the lenders, not the project <lb/>company. <lb/> guarantees extended to the commitments provided by non-sovereigns (non-sovereign <lb/>creditworthiness guarantees), which aim at increasing the creditworthiness of commitments <lb/>provided by non-central government entities. <lb/>Table 8 provides examples of these various types of contingent liabilities by the countries that use <lb/>them in their PPP contracts. <lb/>It is also useful to distinguish between different layers of direct fiscal commitments and <lb/>guarantees provided under PPPs (Aslan and Duarte, 2014). Grantor or procuring public institutions <lb/>22 The main contract signed under the PPP models is the implementation contract between the procuring <lb/>institution and the project company, which is usually called &quot; the PPP contract &quot; . There are other <lb/>contracts and sub-contracts regulating mainly the credit, hedging, insurance, construction, operation <lb/>and maintenance issues signed between the related PPP players. <lb/></body>

			<body>can themselves provide some forms of direct fiscal commitments or guarantees to the project <lb/>companies or the creditors for various project risks, depending on the authority given to them by the <lb/>domestic PPP legislations. The second layer of guarantees are provided by the central government <lb/>authority/financial authority (ministries of finance or national treasuries in most cases) to support the <lb/>first level of commitments or provide additional guarantee coverage for certain risks. Aslan and <lb/>Duarte highlight the importance of ensuring coordination between these two levels of institutions <lb/>considering that the implementing institutions would be more prone to take risks to accomplish their <lb/>investment agenda than the finance ministry/treasury, which would be more cautious about the impact <lb/>of these contingent liabilities on the central government budget and debt sustainability. <lb/>Table 8.

			<body>PPP Governance <lb/>OECD Principles for Public Governance of Public Private Partnerships 23 (2012) maps out the key <lb/>players and their responsibilities in PPPs (Table 9). The OECD recommends that there should be a <lb/>body at the central government level approving the PPPs, and this approval decision should be taken <lb/>based on sufficient information on the costs and risks of the project. OECD also advises that in order <lb/>to avoid conflict of interest, the unit promoting the PPP and the unit approving the investment decision <lb/>should be separated. The approving agency should have an understanding of the government&apos;s fiscal <lb/>situation and an interest in maintaining prudent fiscal policy. <lb/>Institutional set-ups for PPP governance differ widely across countries. In some countries there is <lb/>no PPP unit performing the functions that are recommended by the OECD. 24 PPPs are long-term <lb/>contracts calling for strong project management and monitoring skills not only within the private <lb/>parties but also on the side of governments. As part of this broader context, the monitoring and <lb/>management of long term PPP contingent commitments should also be an area of concern for the <lb/>governments and be dealt with at the central government level. <lb/>Table 9.

			<body>Implications for public debt management <lb/>From a public debt manager&apos;s perspective, explicit PPP guarantees of various forms listed above <lb/>are not different from the government credit guarantees discussed in the previous section, in terms of <lb/>their relationship with and potential impacts on public debt and central government budget. However, <lb/>the OECD Survey results indicate that public debt managers are much less involved in the <lb/>management of PPP guarantees than they are with the credit guarantees. Among the 18 countries that <lb/>responded to the question &quot; Is the DMO responsible in the management of the PPP explicit contingent <lb/>liabilities at any level? &quot; only Turkey responded &quot; Yes &quot; . This distance observed in practice between the <lb/>PPP contingent liabilities and public debt managers is difficult to justify. Indeed, there is policy areas <lb/>in which the debt managers might be effectively involved. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">The PPP decision as a model of procurement should be based on a value for money analysis, <lb/>implying that the PPP choice should be proven superior to the traditional procurement model from the <lb/>public party&apos;s perspective. Although quantitative value for money analysis might have differences in <lb/>methodology 27 , it is essential to include the estimated fiscal costs of the project into the calculations. <lb/>This exercise involves taking into account of the PPP guarantees from the very beginning, as these <lb/>guarantees change the risk sharing between the public and the private parties. Thus, guarantee <lb/>valuation should be considered as a critical component of the PPP decision-making. On the other <lb/>hand, value for money analysis should not only be conducted ex-ante but also ex-post, in order to <lb/>ensure that it is maintained throughout the life of the project. <lb/>Given this framework, Table 10 includes suggestions for the public debt managers&apos; possible <lb/>involvement into the PPP processes. The roles suggested might not be relevant for DMOs of some <lb/>countries in which case it is highly recommended to have another central government institution <lb/>performing the listed functions for better management of fiscal risks arising from PPPs. Indeed, the <lb/>interventions suggested for the public debt managers in the below table can be considered as <lb/>complementing the role to be played by the &quot; central budget authority &quot; in the OECD Principles. Public <lb/>debt manager&apos;s risk management and mitigation abilities might well complement budget authority&apos;s <lb/>perspective of fiscal affordability. In jurisdictions where specialized PPP units exist, their role should <lb/>be considered as complementing that of procuring institutions, rather than the central budget authority. <lb/>27 See World Bank (2013) and Burger and Hawkesworth (2011) for detailed information on value for money and <lb/>country practices. <lb/></note>

			<body>Regardless of the issuer institution of the PPP guarantees, the effective management and <lb/>mitigation of fiscal risks arising from the existing PPP portfolio calls for the following functions to be <lb/>performed by the related government units: <lb/> undertaking scenario analysis and stress tests <lb/> providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse fiscal <lb/>sustainability of central government over medium to long term <lb/> providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse debt <lb/>sustainability of central government over medium to long term <lb/> applying ceilings on contingent liabilities from PPPs to promote fiscal discipline. <lb/>Transparency <lb/>Transparency of contingent liabilities increases the likelihood that these liabilities are taken on <lb/>for sound reasons and it helps eliminate the bias toward them. Transparency is particularly important <lb/>in the framework of PPPs, as the governments might be inclined more towards the PPPs if the costs <lb/>and risks are managed in a non-transparent way. <lb/>Raising the awareness of the long-term fiscal impact of PPPs is important for governments and <lb/>they can disclose information on PPPs regardless of the complexity of their budgetary, accounting, and <lb/>statistical standards. This information could include supplementary statistics that provide medium-and <lb/>long-term forecasts of PPP spending and revenue, descriptions of the contracts and their fiscal costs <lb/>and risks, and the contracts themselves (Funke, K et al., 2013). Contingent liabilities under PPPs, in <lb/>this context, are among the critical information to be disclosed as major source of fiscal risk. <lb/>DMOs can work together with the central budget authority in data consolidation, forecasting and <lb/>reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting. <lb/>The degree of the public debt managers&apos; involvement in disclosure is a function of the PPP legislative <lb/>frameworks in countries, which determine their access to the related data. <lb/>2.4. <lb/>Government sponsored insurance programmes <lb/>Government insurance programmes are another major source of explicit contingent liabilities. <lb/>They are special programmes providing insurance coverage for low frequency but high impact events <lb/>like bank failures, floods, earthquakes, terrorist activities, etc., where the form and amount of <lb/>government support or intervention are pre-described explicitly by law. Not surprisingly, these <lb/>insurance programme areas coincide with the sources of large implicit contingent liabilities for <lb/>governments; financial system, terrorist activities, catastrophic events and environmental disasters. In <lb/>other words, government sponsored insurance programmes should be considered as ex ante financial <lb/>measures aimed at increasing governments&apos; readiness for and protection against losses expected from <lb/>certain disastrous events. <lb/>In some insurance schemes, government plays directly the role of an insurance provider (self-<lb/>insurance) while in others it might choose to purchase insurance from the private insurance companies <lb/>(market insurance). In the latter case, the event risk is transferred to the private sector while the risk <lb/>premiums are paid out of the government budget without creating any explicit contingent liability but <lb/>direct commitments. However, there are various different forms of government insurance schemes <lb/>falling between self-insurance and market insurance, depending on the source of risk, availability of <lb/>market for providing insurance against this risk and the policy objectives of the government. <lb/></body>

			<body>Government deposit insurance <lb/>Government deposit insurance is one of the most important and widely applied mechanisms in <lb/>this category 28,29 . Major purposes of the deposit insurance systems are, to offer consumer protection <lb/>and to reduce the risks of bank runs in case of banking failures, runs that can trigger systemic crises. <lb/>Table 11 summarizes the main characteristics of deposit insurance systems in the OECD <lb/>countries based on the database provided by Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2014). In almost all of the OECD <lb/>countries, there exist explicit deposit insurance systems (the exceptions are Israel and New Zealand). <lb/>In terms of the administration of the deposit insurance system, the common practice is to have a <lb/>separate legal entity. This entity is administered publicly, privately or jointly in different country <lb/>cases. The funding source of the system is private in most of the OECD countries; the exceptions <lb/>being Australia and Chile which have government funded insurance systems and in Portugal where the <lb/>system is funded jointly between the public and private sources. In most OECD countries, deposit <lb/>insurance systems are run through a fund into which the premiums paid by the banks are pooled ex <lb/>ante (there are several countries with ex post structures). In other words, the deposit insurance system <lb/>is financed by the banks themselves 30 . <lb/>The insurance coverage provided might be limited based on deposit types, amounts or eligible <lb/>institutions or unlimited covering all the deposits within the banking system. In some cases, the <lb/>insurance coverage is set to be unlimited temporarily, as was the case in some OECD countries during <lb/>the global crisis. Governments sometimes envisage in legislation some contingency plans even if the <lb/>source of funding in the deposit insurance system is not government, considering the possibility that <lb/>the deposit fund reserves available might fall short during the times of bank failures. This &quot; backstop &quot; <lb/>might take the form of pre-approved credit lines from the Treasury, or the institution managing the <lb/>deposit fund might issue bonds or receive loans guaranteed by the government. <lb/>28 Some authors classify deposit insurance among financial guarantees rather than under insurance schemes, <lb/>considering that these are guarantees covering banks&apos; payment obligations towards their depositors in <lb/>case of bank failure. <lb/>29 In Annex A, deposit insurance systems of Turkey, South Africa, Mexico and Sweden are explained in detail. <lb/>30 For detailed information about deposit insurance systems in different countries see Demirgüç-Kunt et al. <lb/>(2014). <lb/></body>

			<body>Implications for public debt management <lb/>The ability and credibility of governments, especially of the ones with relatively less fiscal space, <lb/>in meeting their promises under the deposit insurance systems is an issue, because the maximum <lb/>exposure loss (cash flow at risk) is relatively high considering the level of covered deposits within the <lb/>financial system. Country experiences suggest that during systemic banking crisis, deposit insurance <lb/>fund resources coming from the banks themselves usually fall short of the arising funding needs, <lb/>compelling governments to deploy central government resources and debt financing, mostly in the <lb/>form of bond issuances by DMOs or by the deposit insurance institutions, which are backed <lb/>(guaranteed) by the central government. <lb/>The fiscal costs of systemic banking crisis might be so high that it takes years of collaboration <lb/>between the debt management offices and the deposit insurance institution to pay out or roll over the <lb/>related financial liabilities. In this regard, Mexico is a good example: the 1995 crisis left the deposit <lb/>insurance institution (IPAB) with a stock of liabilities funded from the markets through bond issuances <lb/>guaranteed by the Mexican Congress. The fiscal burden of the Tequila crisis still continues and <lb/>necessitates coordination between the DMO and the IPAB in the bond markets 20 years after the <lb/>crisis. Turkey is yet another example of such an experience in which case it took almost 10 years to <lb/>redeem the securities issued to back the deposit insurance system. <lb/>The involvement by the public debt managers in this governance area is rather limited given the <lb/>special expertise and mandate required for their management. In the survey results among the 18 <lb/></body>

			<body>DMOs who responded, it is only the SNDO having a mandate in the management of government <lb/>deposit insurance programmes. On the other hand, the SNDO performs this function separately from <lb/>its PDM functions. However, public debt managers can work with deposit insurance manager <lb/>institution and financial system regulators in the field of contingent liabilities under deposit insurance <lb/>systems to promote strategic risk taking and risk mitigation. In this context, the following key policies <lb/>can be suggested: <lb/> clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government&apos;s role within the <lb/>system – as insurer/guarantor/liquidity provider <lb/> effective reserve management (in ex ante fund structures) with risk based premium systems <lb/> effective and regular coordination and consultation with deposit insurance managers and <lb/>financial system regulators over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system. <lb/>Other insurance programmes in which governments are involved are mainly disaster risk <lb/>insurance programmes designed for losses from catastrophic events and natural disasters 31 . During the <lb/>last decades, the incidence of catastrophic events, especially those related with climate has increased <lb/>steadily causing large fiscal costs for governments. In parallel with this increase, governments&apos; <lb/>involvement in the catastrophe risk insurance programmes, especially in developed countries, has <lb/>amplified. <lb/>In several countries, governments are involved in insurance programmes mainly due to lack of <lb/>insurance coverage in the private market or unavailability of affordable insurance for the related <lb/>segments of the society. Governments that experienced large-scale catastrophes with high disaster <lb/>relief costs in the past are also more prone to design insurance frameworks. <lb/>Insurance programmes are one of the instruments providing ex ante financing solutions for <lb/>governments in disaster risk management. Other ex-ante financial sources are budget contingencies, <lb/>reserve funds, contingent debt facilities and catastrophe bonds; while ex-post sources include donor <lb/>assistance, budgetary reallocations, domestic and external credits and tax incomes. <lb/>Governments need to analyse their risk bearing capacity before engaging in such insurance <lb/>programmes. This analysis includes assessments of government&apos;s fiscal position, budgetary flexibility, <lb/>public debt sustainability, as well as the ability to have access to financing resources in the post <lb/>disaster conditions. This exercise is combined with the technical assessment of the probability of event <lb/>occurring. If the disaster risk is minor and the risk bearing capacity is high, ex post solutions would be <lb/>more rational for some governments (G20/OECD, 2012) 32 . <lb/>When the insurance is deemed necessary, governments can get involved in this process in various <lb/>ways. The appropriate role for the government would depend on the programme features, policy <lb/>objectives, and the extent to which the government plans to assume the costs of the disaster risk <lb/>covered. <lb/></body>

			<body>In the case of self-insurance (direct insurer) solutions, public reserve fund applications are quite <lb/>common practice, which are similar to contingency reserve funds discussed under the government <lb/>credit guarantees section. National Calamity Fund in Colombia, Environmental Contingency Fund of <lb/>U.S., and Natural Disaster Fund in Mexico are yet several examples of many. Although they are <lb/>regarded as useful risk mitigation tools, as in the case of actual funds for credit guarantees, there is a <lb/>cost attached to holding a cash fund with the expectation of a future natural disaster. <lb/>Governments are also involved in insurance programmes by explicitly guaranteeing a part of the <lb/>liabilities to occur under the programme. These guarantees usually take the form of backstop <lb/>arrangements under deposit insurance, or guarantees provided under PPPs, in the sense that they are <lb/>forms of risk sharing with the private sector while increasing the credibility of the system in covering <lb/>the anticipated future losses. There might be a layered approach with private insurers or funds, i.e. <lb/>damages are covered by the market until a certain threshold amount for the government guarantee to <lb/>be called. <lb/>Implications for public debt management <lb/>The G20/OECD Methodological Framework for Disaster Risk Assessment and Risk Financing <lb/>(2012) explains the appropriate role of finance ministries in disaster risk management and financing <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">frameworks as: &quot; Finance Ministries have a key role in ensuring an effective approach to the financial <lb/>management of disaster risks – promoting the role of risk financing markets where feasible, ensuring <lb/>the proper design of any market interventions, considering the development of public financial aid <lb/>arrangements and programmes as a complement to any private compensation mechanisms and <lb/>engaging in sound fiscal management of government contingent liabilities. Being centrally placed to <lb/>affect the financial sector, budget making and the provision of financial guarantees, Finance Ministries <lb/>have the responsibility to ensure that financial strategies for DRM are well integrated, efficient and <lb/>effective. At a time when many countries are facing severe financial constraints, identifying the source <lb/>of potential contingent liabilities and providing ex ante frameworks for managing them contributes to <lb/>more robust public finances in the long term. Finance Ministries also have an important stake in <lb/>ensuring the quality and policy relevance of country risk assessments and strengthening their own <lb/>input into the risk assessment process as a means to ensure the development of cost-effective DRM <lb/>strategies and financial strategies &quot; . <lb/>Following from this framework policy recommendations, contingent liabilities arising from <lb/>government insurance programmes are among the areas where centralised fiscal risk management <lb/>function of the government would be useful. As part of this function, public debt managers can be <lb/>consulted in developing financing strategies and guarantees under these programmes, including the <lb/>stage where the need for such ex ante programmes are assessed. From the perspective of public debt <lb/>managers, government insurance as an ex ante source of risk financing would seem preferable over ex <lb/>post search for funds when the disasters are realised. However, this preference might not be that <lb/>straightforward as country specific and programme specific cost-risk analysis might prove ex-post <lb/>solutions less costly. Thus, analyses involving finance ministries and DMOs are highly recommended <lb/>before enrolling governments in these programmes with direct and contingent fiscal commitments by <lb/>the governments. <lb/></note>

			<body>PART 3. SUMMARY OF POLICY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>Policy conclusions and recommendations <lb/>This paper examines the role of public debt managers in the following three categories of <lb/>contingent liabilities and included several recommendations under each section. Although intended for <lb/>the public debt managers, in countries where DMOs do not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal <lb/>risk management in general and contingent liability management in particular these recommendations <lb/>might be relevant for other government units. <lb/>Government credit guarantees <lb/>This study included examples from the implementation frameworks showing that the DMOs are <lb/>involved in the management of government credit guarantees at different stages including the <lb/>assessment of guarantee proposals, contract design and the risk management of the credit guarantee <lb/>portfolio. The main recommendations of this study are the following: <lb/>-Costs and risks of the credit guarantee should be calculated to inform the decision-making <lb/>authorities accordingly. <lb/>-Programme loan guarantees should have clearly-stated objectives and a set of rules or a code <lb/>of conduct for granting. <lb/>-Fees corresponding to at least the expected cost of each guarantee should be charged from the <lb/>beneficiaries. <lb/>-The terms of the credit guarantee contracts should be drafted in a way as to clearly define and <lb/>limit the guarantee in time and scope. <lb/>-A ceiling on the stock or new issuances of credit guarantees might be helpful to promote fiscal <lb/>discipline, limit the fiscal risk exposure and direct the policy-makers towards prioritisation <lb/>among the applications. <lb/>-Contingency reserve funds, whether actual or notional, is a useful tool to increase the <lb/>governments&apos; ability to cover possible future losses and monitor their financial position vis-à-<lb/>vis the existing guarantees. <lb/>-Both quantitative and qualitative information on credit guarantees should be disclosed based <lb/>on their expected cost and in such a way as to give a complete picture of the government&apos;s <lb/>total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and budgetary <lb/>documentation. <lb/>Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs <lb/>The country practices in the area of PPP contingent liabilities revealed that DMOs are generally <lb/>not involved in their management. However, based on the OECD/G20 recommendations for effective <lb/></body>

			<body>PPP governance, certain functions to be performed by the central government units were discussed. In <lb/>this context, this study recommends that public debt managers can well work together with other <lb/>government units in the field of PPP guarantees. The main recommendations in this area are the <lb/>following: <lb/> The PPP fiscal risks can be mitigated through strengthening the regulatory frameworks, <lb/>strengthening the management and oversight frameworks, increasing transparency and <lb/>integrating PPPs into the medium term budget process (IMF, 2014). <lb/> As is the case for the government credit guarantees, a central government unit should analyse <lb/>the PPP guarantees to inform the decision-making authorities on the associated costs and <lb/>risks. <lb/> Guarantee valuation should be considered as a critical component of the PPP decision <lb/>making since the guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and the private <lb/>partner. <lb/> Contingent liabilities under the PPP contracts should be centrally monitored at the central <lb/>government level for the purpose of ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability. <lb/> DMOs can work together with the central budget authority and the PPP units in data <lb/>consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or <lb/>include this information in their debt reporting. <lb/>Government sponsored insurance schemes <lb/>Government deposit insurance systems and other government sponsored insurance programmes <lb/>were discussed with examples from countries. The study showed that these insurance programmes <lb/>comprise explicit contingent commitments on the side of governments. The degree of the DMOs&apos; <lb/>involvement in these special expertise areas was also quite low, based on the survey results. However, <lb/>the following recommendations for the public debt managers were provided: <lb/> Stability in the financial markets is crucial for public debt managers and a healthy banking <lb/>system that runs with effective prudential regulations, and supervision, with a credible and <lb/>well managed deposit insurance framework would contribute to this end. <lb/> Public debt managers are recommended to be well informed of the contingent liabilities <lb/>under the government sponsored insurance systems. <lb/> Clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government&apos;s role within the <lb/>insurance programmes are recommended. <lb/> Regular coordination between deposit and other insurance managers and public debt <lb/>managers over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system are considered useful. <lb/> Analyses involving finance ministries and DMOs are highly recommended before enrolling <lb/>governments in the insurance programmes with direct and contingent fiscal commitments. <lb/></body>
