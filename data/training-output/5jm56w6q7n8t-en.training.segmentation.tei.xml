			<body>Executive summary <lb/>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently <lb/>negotiating a new agreement, under the auspices of the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban <lb/>Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP). This new agreement is to be adopted at the 21st Conference of <lb/>the Parties (COP 21) in December 2015, and to take effect from 2020. At the centre of the new <lb/>agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are the national objectives and <lb/>actions that countries are willing to put forward to the international community, and be bound by in <lb/>some way. To date, all proposed intended NDCs (INDCs) include a mitigation component, most an <lb/>adaptation component as well, while only some quantify the financial support required for <lb/>implementation. The mitigation component of INDCs generally cover five to ten year periods. For the <lb/>post-2020 period, the current ADP draft agreement text distinguishes between nationally determined <lb/>mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMCs), and other types of undertakings, actions and <lb/>communications in non-mitigation areas, such as adaptation, or the provision and mobilisation of <lb/>climate finance. <lb/>Within the climate negotiations, Parties are discussing mechanisms that would allow NDMCs to be <lb/>updated and communicated regularly. Such regular communications may be accompanied and <lb/>bolstered by one or more multilateral processes, some of which may play the role of assessing <lb/>whether NDMCs are collectively or individually consistent with collectively-agreed climate <lb/>objectives. The process of submitting a national contribution or commitment, and its potential passage <lb/>through these international processes, is referred to as a &quot; cycle &quot; . The aim of having a cycle is to <lb/>encourage greater ambition from NDCs over time, and to enable an agreement that remains dynamic <lb/>in the longer term. Dynamism is understood as a process that allows mitigation contributions or <lb/>commitments under the new agreement to respond and adapt to changing needs, circumstances, <lb/>technology changes, and knowledge. <lb/>This paper focuses on nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments. The &quot; cycle &quot; <lb/>primarily refers to the phases of NDMCs, e.g. how they are communicated internationally, and what <lb/>multilateral assessment processes they may be subject to. Discussions during the course of the ADP <lb/>negotiations in 2015 have sought to balance the national flexibility inherent in NDMCs with <lb/>international responsibility and environmental integrity, by setting out a process for how and how <lb/>often NDMCs are put forward, and proposing potential multilateral review or stocktake exercises. <lb/>Ways of encouraging the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs can be grouped in three broad <lb/>categories that are currently included in different articles of the draft agreement text: <lb/>• The international procedures applied to the mitigation contributions or commitments <lb/>themselves, such as when they are formulated and communicated, whether they can be <lb/>adjusted, and any conditions or requirements they should meet (Article 3). <lb/>• Multilateral processes that would examine NDMCs collectively, such as an aggregation <lb/>exercise (Article 3) and the global stocktake (Article 10). <lb/>• Multilateral processes that would examine individual NDMCs, such as a clarification <lb/>exercise (Article 3), various exercises as part of the transparency or measurement, reporting <lb/>and verification (MRV) system (Article 9), and potential review processes included in any <lb/>facilitative compliance and implementation system (Article 11). <lb/>Provisions for the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs are currently contained mostly in two <lb/>provisions: first, a requirement that NDMCs become more ambitious over time, and represent a <lb/>Party&apos;s highest level of ambition; second, the option that NDMCs are communicated at regular <lb/>intervals, with every five years proposed in the text. There are implementation challenges associated <lb/>with both elements, including how the notion of ambition and progression can concretely be defined <lb/>or determined. Overall, these provisions could encourage countries to increase their mitigation efforts, <lb/>and provide a formal opportunity for countries to revise and update their contributions and <lb/></body>

			<body>commitments at regular intervals. Already, several Parties have indicated that they may unilaterally <lb/>revise their INDCs. <lb/>One of the multilateral processes proposed at the collective level, the aggregation exercise, does not <lb/>appear aimed at influencing the individual NDMCs. The terminology used is similar to that of the <lb/>current synthesis report on INDCs, which despite significant information gaps, presents the aggregate <lb/>effect of INDCs on future emissions trajectories. The global stocktake is described as a process to <lb/>examine how Parties are implementing the agreement and meeting its objectives. There are proposals <lb/>in the draft text that accounting for the outcomes of the global stocktake should be a feature of <lb/>NDMCs. Meant to cover all aspects of the agreement, including mitigation, the specifics of how the <lb/>global stocktake will consider all elements is unclear. An assessment of collective progress towards <lb/>mitigation objectives should help guide action at a national level, though may not provide specific <lb/>insight into how an individual country might adjust its objectives and maximise mitigation <lb/>opportunities. Currently, the existing 2013-2-15 Review process – designed to assess both the <lb/>adequacy of the long-term global temperature goal and progress towards achieving it – may provide a <lb/>basis for parts of a global stocktake exercise. <lb/>In terms of multilateral processes for individual NDMCs, the draft agreement text proposes that these <lb/>undergo a clarification exercise once they are communicated, but beyond this individual review <lb/>processes are mentioned mostly within text on a transparency framework. Current review and <lb/>consultation processes under the UNFCCC provide a basis for tracking progress with the <lb/>implementation of NDMCs, notably through biennial reporting, technical review of reports, and peer-<lb/>to-peer consultations. Such processes will likely evolve going forward, and could assess the <lb/>implementation of individual NDMCs, as well as feed into their potential adjustment or revision. <lb/>Assessment and review processes can be thought of as opportunities for feedback and reflection, <lb/>aligned with moments within a cycle when countries have the opportunity to adjust or update their <lb/>NDMCs. They may play an important role within a potential facilitative compliance and <lb/>implementation system, though how specifically this would operate remains to be decided. <lb/>Figure ES-1 presents a possible simplified process for communicating NDMCs, and the multilateral <lb/>processes that could support both communication and implementation of these NDMCs. Boxes in <lb/>dashed outlines represent possible options, as these are currently proposals among others within the <lb/>text. The dotted lines represent potential lines of influence. Where the text proposes a time interval <lb/>between communication and finalisation of a NDMC, this would likely not be long enough to allow a <lb/>country to adjust its NDMC. Any multilateral processes taking place in this time interval are therefore <lb/>not presented as potentially influencing individual NDMCs. <lb/></body>

In Paris, Parties will <lb/>also need to decide on the status and processes for INDCs, including how these may be adjusted or <lb/>updated prior to 2020. <lb/>Having a dynamic cycle for NDMCs is important; countries will be starting from very different <lb/>points, and should be able to revise and adjust actions according to evolving circumstances. Apart <lb/>from exceptional circumstances, adjustment or revisions should occur within the context of NDMCs <lb/>reflecting a Party&apos;s highest possible ambition, and becoming progressively more ambitious over time. <lb/>Ambition also requires continuous learning and experimentation, to adequately respond to the climate <lb/>challenge and consistently improve national policies. Dynamic NDMCs could contribute to the <lb/>longer-term, transformational changes required for sustainable, resilient, low-emission development. <lb/></note>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently <lb/>negotiating a new agreement under the Convention, to be adopted at the 21st Conference of the <lb/>Parties (COP 21) in December 2015, and to take effect from 2020. This negotiation is taking place <lb/>under the auspices of the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action <lb/>(ADP). The new agreement aims to provide a framework for enhancing and accelerating <lb/>implementation of UNFCCC, in all relevant areas, namely adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology, <lb/>capacity building and transparency. An important element of this new framework is that its provisions <lb/>will apply to all Parties (unlike the Kyoto Protocol for example); it therefore needs to allow for <lb/>diversity. This has led to a &quot; bottom-up &quot; approach, whereby countries determine the actions they are <lb/>willing to be bound by. If the agreement is to be durable over time, it will also need to be flexible and <lb/>dynamic, and be able to evolve. It is in this context that current negotiations have discussed various <lb/>ways of ensuring that climate goals undertaken by Parties are dynamic and progressively more <lb/>ambitious over time. <lb/>At the centre of the new agreement are nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These are the <lb/>objectives and actions relating to mitigation or other aspects of climate change responses that <lb/>countries are willing to put forward internationally and be bound by in some way, as part of the 2105 <lb/>agreement (pending decisions on legal form). In the course of 2015, countries have been submitting <lb/>intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), ahead of a decision on how they will be <lb/>formalised and anchored in the new agreement. The mitigation component of current INDCs cover <lb/>either a five-or ten-year time period starting from 2020, setting a greenhouse gas (GHG) target to be <lb/>achieved in either 2030 or 2025, with most selecting a 2025 target. <lb/>This paper focuses on nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMCs) 1 for <lb/>several reasons. First, because the notion of &quot; progress &quot; and &quot; greater ambition &quot; are easily understood <lb/>in these terms. This is in part because there is experience with expressing a collective, long-term <lb/>objective for mitigation that progress can be assessed against. It is also easier to understand the <lb/>general direction of travel implied by &quot; greater ambition &quot; in a mitigation context, i.e. fewer GHG <lb/>emissions. Second, mitigation is an area in which collective action problems are most pressing. <lb/>Dynamism in this paper is understood as a process that allows contributions or commitments under <lb/>the new agreement to respond and adapt to changing needs, circumstances, technologies and <lb/>knowledge. Dynamism includes the notion of flexibility, acknowledging that countries are starting <lb/>from different places and need the flexibility to appropriately enhance and adjust their contributions. <lb/>This paper seeks to clarify and discuss ideas contained in the draft agreement and draft decision text <lb/>for the 2015 agreement that may serve to enhance the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs. This paper <lb/>does not deal with differentiation, a broader political issue that will shape all aspects of the 2015 <lb/>agreement. Further, it does not address areas directly related to the legal nature of contributions and <lb/>other &quot; undertakings &quot; within the 2015 agreement, such as compliance and enforcement, nor does it <lb/>focus on adaptation or support. <lb/>Section 2 of the paper provides some background and context to how and why dynamism and <lb/>ambition have emerged as important elements within negotiations toward the 2015 agreement. Section <lb/>3 examines the procedures applied to mitigation contributions or commitments, and how these can <lb/>impact dynamism and ambition. Section 4 looks at how various multilateral assessment and review <lb/>processes may also enhance the ambition of mitigation contributions or commitments. The paper aims <lb/>to explore the various concepts proposed, and indicate key questions and options to guide decision <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 The draft agreement text more comprehensively provides the option of: mitigation contribution; mitigation <lb/>commitment; a nationally determined contribution with a mitigation component, or the mitigation component of <lb/>the contribution referred to in Article 2 bis (i.e., a nationally determined contribution) <lb/></note>

			<body>9 <lb/>making. Section 5 concludes with some initial thoughts on areas that will require decisions from <lb/>Parties at COP 21 and shortly thereafter. <lb/>2. Dynamism and ambition in the current negotiations <lb/>The need of diversity and flexibility is integrated into NDCs, as these are &quot; nationally determined &quot; and <lb/>therefore vary according to the capacities and circumstances of each individual Party. The notion <lb/>commonly referred to as &quot; cycles &quot; in the negotiations has centred on NDCs, referring to procedures <lb/>and processes that would allow NDCs to evolve, and encourage them to become more ambitious, <lb/>thereby allowing countries to meet collectively-agreed climate objectives. <lb/>The scope of NDCs themselves will influence these cycles. Current INDCs cover mitigation, and <lb/>several also cover adaptation and other aspects. For example, some countries specify the amount of <lb/>financing, including external support, needed to implement their INDCs (e.g. Benin, Kenya, Trinidad <lb/>and Tobago). No submission to date includes the amount of support (financial, technology and <lb/>capacity building) that a country might provide over the INDC&apos;s time period, which some Parties had <lb/>suggested should be included in the NDCs of developed countries (FCCC/ADP/2015/1). <lb/>Following the adoption of the 2015 agreement, more specific terminology may emerge that <lb/>distinguishes mitigation contributions or commitments and other types of contributions, commitments <lb/>or actions, such as on adaptation or support. The current draft agreement text suggests that &quot; nationally <lb/>determined &quot; mitigation contributions or commitments (NDMC), or the mitigation component of <lb/>nationally determined contributions, would be distinct from adaptation &quot; communications &quot; or <lb/> &quot; undertakings &quot; that could include adaptation plans, priorities and needs (ADP, 2015a). Processes for <lb/>determining how commitments, contributions and communications are updated, and at what <lb/>frequency, will likely also differ for mitigation and adaptation. <lb/>Some countries have explicitly reserved the right to adjust their INDCs prior to 2020 (e.g. Morocco, <lb/>New Zealand). There are many reasons countries might wish to do so. For developed countries, most <lb/>conditionality in current INDCs is related to the finalisation of rules governing the initial round of <lb/>NDCs (on accounting, for example), which should be addressed by the second round of NDCs. <lb/>Several developing countries have also presented INDCs that are wholly or partly conditional on the <lb/>provision of support. In addition, some countries may adjust their INDCs pending political decisions <lb/>(e.g. Swaziland, Lao PDR) or when more information becomes available (e.g. Philippines). Countries <lb/>with mitigation targets set against business-as-usual emissions may also wish to update these <lb/>scenarios and assumptions. Even where the mitigation component of an INDC is presented as a <lb/>package of policies and measures, the short timeframe in which many countries have had to develop <lb/>their INDC means ensuring its coherence and implementability may also be a challenge. As such, <lb/>many may benefit from being able to clarify, update, augment or otherwise hone their INDC ahead of <lb/>its expected implementation date. <lb/>Discussions during ADP negotiations in 2015 have sought to balance the &quot; bottom up &quot; national <lb/>flexibility inherent in NDCs with international credibility, responsibility and environmental integrity, <lb/>through more &quot; top down &quot; procedures for how and how often NDMCs are put forward, along with <lb/>multilateral review or stocktake processes. A range of ideas on different processes were put forward <lb/>in February 2015, some of which are now reflected in the draft agreement text. The means put in <lb/>place to encourage the dynamism and ambition of NDMCs can be grouped in three broad categories <lb/>that are currently included in different articles of the draft agreement text: <lb/>10 <lb/>• The international procedures applied to the mitigation contributions or commitments <lb/>themselves, such as when they are formulated and communicated, whether they can be <lb/>adjusted, and any conditions or requirements they should meet (Article 3). <lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine NDMCs collectively, such as an aggregation <lb/>exercise (Article 3) and the global stocktake (Article 10). <lb/> • Multilateral processes that would examine individual NDMCs, such as a clarification <lb/>exercise (Article 3), various exercises as part of the transparency or measurement, reporting <lb/>and verification (MRV) system (Article 9), and potential review processes included in any <lb/>facilitative compliance and implementation system (Article 11).<lb/>Maximising the potential of NDMCs to increase in ambition over time is important for several <lb/>reasons. First, because based on the mitigation component of current INDCs, the first set of NDMCs <lb/>will likely be insufficiently ambitious from a mitigation perspective (Hood, Adkins and Levina, <lb/>2015). The new climate agreement would therefore aim to set a basis for action that would become <lb/>more ambitious over time. Second, countries will be starting from very different points; as such, it is <lb/>important that countries are able to revise and adjust actions in line with changing circumstances, <lb/>priorities, technologies, capacities and needs. Some countries have already revised some aspects of <lb/>their INDCs (e.g. Benin), and the current draft agreement includes the option for countries to adjust <lb/>their NDMCs at any time so long as ambition is increased. Flexibility is enhanced if countries can <lb/>update or revise their contributions regularly, e.g. every five years, and potentially have the <lb/>opportunity to adjust them at other times as well. Implementing ambitious climate policy is a <lb/>continuous learning process. Economic circumstances change and are dynamic, and so effective <lb/>policy responses will also be dynamic. International review and stocktake processes can act as <lb/>feedback points to support the revision and updating of national policies, to account for successes, <lb/>new challenges, and evolving priorities, as well as identify areas for improvement. <lb/>Third, at a collective level, it is useful for countries to know whether nationally determined mitigation <lb/>contributions or commitments are broadly consistent with what is needed to meet longer-term <lb/>collective climate objectives. Dynamic NDMCs would ideally fit within longer-term indicative <lb/>pathways, such as low-emission development strategies, and allow for shorter term actions that would <lb/>lead to the longer-term, transformational changes required (Hood, Briner and Rocha, 2014; Spencer et <lb/>al., 2014). NDMCs and longer-term pathways should generally be consistent with any global, long-<lb/>term climate objective expressed within the 2015 agreement. For mitigation this could be the <lb/>previously stated objective of limiting average global surface temperature warming to 2°C above pre-<lb/>industrial levels by the end of the century, or a different formulation of this objective (e.g. net zero <lb/>emissions over the course of the century). <lb/>3. Procedures applied to mitigation contributions or commitments <lb/>While the current draft negotiating text remains under debate (ADP, 2015a), options for the <lb/>framework and procedures applying to nationally determined mitigation contributions or <lb/>commitments include ideas that impact their responsiveness and their evolution. <lb/>The substance of NDMCs themselves may be framed in such a way as to encourage ambition over <lb/>time. For example, the draft text contains language that would require or expect each NDMC to <lb/>reflect a given country&apos;s highest possible ambition, reflect a progression beyond the Party&apos;s previous <lb/>efforts, or be progressively more ambitious over time. Contributions or commitments would therefore <lb/>need to become more ambitious as part of how they are formulated. Other framing elements also <lb/>present both opportunities for enhancing action, as well as challenges in terms of their implications <lb/>for implementation and their feasibility (Table 1). <lb/></body>

Even if not directly <lb/>linked, countries could be encouraged to link <lb/>NDMCs to their own relevant long-term goals <lb/>(low emissions, sustainable development, <lb/>poverty reduction, etc.), or indicate how <lb/>domestic long-term goals are consistent with <lb/>collective ones. Could be a feature of NDMCs, <lb/>or included in the information provided with <lb/>their communication (e.g. reporting on how the <lb/>NDMC links to long-term goals). <lb/>Quantitatively establishing such a link can be <lb/>challenging, and is less relevant for small <lb/>emitters. <lb/>NDMCs to <lb/>have specific <lb/>features? <lb/>List of various features in the text, some of <lb/>which may facilitate monitoring of NDMC <lb/>(e.g. should be quantifiable, have real and <lb/>verifiable data for baselines), or encourage <lb/>linking these to multilateral processes (e.g. <lb/>take into account global stocktake, process to <lb/>facilitate implementation). <lb/>Given the diversity of NDMCs and national <lb/>circumstances, could be difficult to agree on <lb/>a list of features. May also imply that <lb/>reporting and review processes will also <lb/>consider whether NDMCs do actually <lb/>contain these features, which could be <lb/>complex (e.g. assessing whether the NDMC <lb/>maximises adaptation co-benefits). <lb/>Requirements <lb/>for progression <lb/>and ambition <lb/>in successive <lb/>NDMCs? <lb/>Important for steady increases in ambition over <lb/>time; allows for different starting points and <lb/>diversity of action. <lb/>How specifically the notion is expressed, and <lb/>how broad or narrow the meaning of &quot; more <lb/>ambitious &quot; or &quot; highest possible ambition &quot; is, <lb/>can have a significant impact (e.g. An <lb/>increase in headline numbers? Expanding <lb/>coverage of activities? Addressing gaps in <lb/>previous implementation?). May have <lb/>implications for transparency system, if <lb/>answering such questions included in <lb/>consultation or review processes. Parties may <lb/>need reassurance that there can exceptions to <lb/>the rule, in cases of force majeure. <lb/>Adjustments at <lb/>any time? <lb/>Can be important to allow countries to refine <lb/>and update NDMCs in light of changed <lb/>circumstances, shifting priorities, previous <lb/>implementation, etc. Option currently included <lb/>in the text allows for updates to NDMCs so <lb/>long as they meet the requirement of <lb/>progression in ambition. <lb/>An adjustment or update process may need <lb/>accompanying transparency provisions. <lb/>While potentially sensitive, the agreement <lb/>may also benefit from allowing countries to <lb/>decrease the ambition of their NDMCs in <lb/>certain circumstances, to allow for a more <lb/>flexible and durable regime (Briner, Kato and <lb/>Hattori, 2014). Special provisions are likely <lb/>needed in these cases. <lb/>The primary means by which dynamism is introduced is the notion that contributions or commitments <lb/>are communicated along regular intervals, every five years. These intervals could be independent of <lb/>the length of each contribution or commitment, with either a successive NDMC communicated if its <lb/>period length is five years, or an updated NDMC communicated if it spans ten years. The text <lb/>includes the option of communication occurring either before the end of the period of implementation <lb/>(e.g. before 2030 for the period 2021-2030), or after the completion of the current implementation <lb/>cycle (e.g. after 2030 for the same period). These options appears distinct from that of regularly <lb/>communicating NDMCs every five years; as such, if the time periods covered by contributions or <lb/>commitments vary (either five or ten years), this would mean countries would communicate their <lb/></body>

			<body>NDMCs at different moments in time. Different options for the communication of NDMCs, along <lb/>with the advantages and challenges they present, are outlined in Table 2. <lb/>Table 2.

Timeline suggested <lb/>makes both substantive review or <lb/>associated adjustments unlikely. May not <lb/>be essential if clear guidance on NMDC <lb/>framing elements and/or information <lb/>provided during communication, or if <lb/>clarification exercise integrated into <lb/>transparency system in future. <lb/>Communication to <lb/>occur every five years <lb/>(independent of <lb/>NDMC length) <lb/>Encourages and allows for dynamism; <lb/>more flexibility to adjust NMDCs if <lb/>formal opportunity to communicate at <lb/>regular intervals. Does not require NDMC <lb/>lengths to be harmonised; countries with <lb/>longer NDMCs could re-communicate <lb/>these, to present any revisions. <lb/>Given the time needed to prepare and <lb/>consult on national climate policy, some <lb/>countries may find it challenging to <lb/>meaningfully assess and update a NDMC <lb/>at five-yearly intervals. <lb/>Indicative/intended <lb/>NMDC to also be <lb/>communicated, for <lb/>period after submitted <lb/>NMDC <lb/>Longer-term policy objectives helpful for <lb/>national planning and investments; can <lb/>facilitate assessment of global progress <lb/>through more information on potential <lb/>future emissions pathways. <lb/>Challenging to put forward longer-term <lb/>mitigation objectives, particularly for <lb/>countries with rapid and uncertain growth <lb/>trajectories. <lb/>Communication to <lb/>occur before end of <lb/>NDMC period <lb/>Potentially simpler for Party, can follow <lb/>timing of internal evaluation and revision <lb/>of climate objectives. <lb/>Could be nearly ten years between <lb/>communications depending on NDMC <lb/>length; no &quot; nudging &quot; Parties to examine <lb/>their NDMCs sooner. Parties may <lb/>communicate at differing intervals, <lb/>reducing collective momentum. <lb/>Communication to <lb/>occur after end of <lb/>NDMC period <lb/>Potentially simpler for Party, as above. In <lb/>addition, may have more information on <lb/>implementation and outcomes of previous <lb/>NDMC period. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">Risk of a gap between NDMC periods, <lb/>with no formal contribution or <lb/>commitment in place. As above, could be <lb/>long intervals between communications, <lb/>which would vary by NDMC length. <lb/>Note: These options apply to NDMCs that are not all of the same length, e.g. some span five years and others ten. <lb/>Within the draft agreement text, one option is for communication to be a fully integrated step, <lb/>automatically leading to listing in a registry or annex. Alternatively, an intended or proposed <lb/>commitment or contribution may first be communicated, which would then be finalised after a given <lb/>amount of time (e.g. 12-18 months, proposed in the text). In turn, finalisation would take place a <lb/>certain amount of time before the meeting of the Parties at which NDMCs are &quot; inscribed &quot; , with <lb/>proposals for this length of time to be &quot; at least three months &quot; or &quot; well before &quot; . The concrete timing of <lb/>these procedures therefore remains unclear, but suggests that any distinct communication, finalisation <lb/>and inscription procedures would occur within a relatively short time period, e.g. one to two years. <lb/>This condensed timeframe is somewhat different from previous mitigation pledges, as well as from <lb/>current INDCs. As mentioned above, to date Parties have communicated mitigation pledges or <lb/>objectives five years ahead of their start date, in 2015 for INDCs that generally cover a five to ten-<lb/>year time period starting in 2020.

			<body>implementation of mitigation contributions or commitments remains important, including for guiding <lb/>domestic policy and economic activity (see e.g. OECD, 2015). Various analysts had suggested a <lb/>similar procedure for NDCs under the 2015 agreement, with countries determining their contributions <lb/>or commitments several years before their official implementation date. Spencer, Zhang et al. (2015) <lb/>suggested Parties propose new contributions for the 2030-35 period in 2019-20, and Morgan, Dagnet <lb/>and Tirpak (2014) similarly suggested that Parties communicate contributions for the 2025-30 period <lb/>in 2018-19, and then formalise or anchor these by 2020. The text does retain the option for Parties to <lb/>provide an indicative or intended NDMC for the period after the submitted contribution or <lb/>commitment, e.g. for the 2035-40 period if a NDMC for 2030-35 has been communicated. <lb/>Providing a longer-term trajectory within which to place NDMCs, particularly if these span five years, <lb/>can facilitate both domestic planning and a collective assessment of emissions trajectories. However, <lb/>there can also be challenges associated with proposing targets ten or fifteen years ahead of time for <lb/>many countries, especially when economic growth trajectories are rapid and uncertain. Successive <lb/>NDMCs are likely to be communicated before the end of the current NDMC&apos;s implementation period. <lb/>A country would therefore need to propose a contribution or commitment for a future period before <lb/>knowing the final results of how its current NDMC had been implemented, due to delays in the <lb/>production of official GHG emissions statistics. Allowing countries to adjust proposed contributions <lb/>prior to and during their implementation period may therefore be necessary. The current text includes <lb/>an option for Parties to be able to update their NDMC at any time, if it &quot; represents a progression in <lb/>ambition beyond its previous efforts &quot; . For INDCs, various proposals within the accompanying draft <lb/>decision text propose or encourage updates or adjustments to INDCs prior to when the agreement <lb/>takes effect. <lb/>How much time elapses between communication, finalisation and the contribution or commitment <lb/>start date – and the prevalence of opportunities for deliberation, assessment and feedback – might <lb/>impact the dynamism of contributions or commitments. Once a contribution is agreed upon <lb/>domestically, it may be difficult to modify it in the short term. If countries are to finalise their <lb/>NDMCs 12-18 months after initial communication, it is unlikely that any significant revisions to the <lb/>contribution or commitment itself could be made. The focus would therefore be on successive <lb/>contributions or commitments, and ensuring these are as ambitious as possible when communicated. <lb/>However, assessment and feedback opportunities could also play a role in strengthening <lb/>implementation of the NDMC, which is another means of enhancing ambition, for example, by <lb/>facilitating over-achievement of NDMC objectives. Several assessment and review processes <lb/>mentioned in the draft negotiating text could play this role. <lb/>4. Multilateral review and assessment processes related to NDMCs <lb/>4.1 <lb/>Existing multilateral processes under the UNFCCC and elsewhere <lb/>Multilateral review and/or assessment processes could enable dynamism and encourage greater <lb/>ambition of mitigation contributions or commitments, by providing opportunities for feedback and <lb/>reflection that can assist with domestic policy processes. These processes can take various forms, and <lb/>certain terms and ideas are distinguished in Box 1 for the purposes of this paper. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<front>Most of the processes described in Box 1 already exist, in some form, within the UNFCCC. The <lb/>technical reviews of inventories (annually), Biennial Reports (biennially) and National <lb/>Communications (every four years) for Annex I countries contain recommendations to improve the <lb/>completeness and transparency of future reports. The Multilateral Assessment for developed countries <lb/>is a biennial non-technical process conducted by all Parties, discussing progress towards achieving the <lb/>Party in question&apos;s emissions reduction target. There is no set framework or basis on which an <lb/>assessment is made, but Parties do ask questions to evaluate the quality and nature of the assessed <lb/>Party&apos;s actions and accomplishments, including on additional actions needed to achieve targets, and <lb/>the effects of policies and measures (UNFCCC, 2015a). To date, developing country National <lb/>Communications and Biennial Update Reports are not subject to review; the latter are subject to a <lb/>biennial technical assessment, and a non-technical process involving peer-to-peer exchange referred <lb/>to as a &quot; facilitative exchange of views &quot; . Established outside the regular MRV system, the 2013-15 <lb/>Review is a form of global stocktake. This primarily involved taking stock of the latest science to <lb/>determine the adequacy of the 2°C objective, but also assessed overall progress towards the <lb/>Convention&apos;s objective. <lb/>Assessment and review processes under the UNFCCC can focus on both process and substance, in <lb/>varying degrees. Current reviews of National Communications and Biennial Reports, for example, <lb/>assess these documents against their respective reporting guidelines. Recommendations are mostly <lb/>related to reporting provisions, such as on improving the completeness and transparency of reporting. <lb/>However, in some cases reviews also comment on the content being reported, for example, indicating <lb/>that a country is unlikely to meet its mitigation target based on the projections it has provided. <lb/>Box 1: Terms used for review processes and their working definitions <lb/>Assessment: A process where the nature, quality, ability or value of something is evaluated or estimated. As such, <lb/>it implies the use of an assessment framework or set of criteria. For example, the completeness and transparency <lb/>of national reports for Annex I countries is assessed against a set of guidelines. Biennial Update Reports submitted <lb/>by developing countries under the UNFCCC are also subject to a technical assessment. An assessment can <lb/>therefore select different criteria against which to evaluate the nature or ambition of, for example, a national <lb/>contribution or commitment. <lb/>Review: Commonly denotes a formal assessment undertaken with the intention of instituting or recommending <lb/>change. In this sense, review generally denotes a process which looks at historical performance and produces an <lb/>assessment that aims to guide any changes needed, including through explicit recommendations. For example, <lb/>technical reviews of Annex I National Communications result in recommendations to improve the transparency <lb/>and completeness of future reports, based on an assessment framed by the reporting guidelines. <lb/>Stocktake: The act of reviewing and assessing a given situation and associated options, often used to denote a <lb/>reappraisal or reassessment of a situation, along with its progress and prospects. It suggests an exercise that looks <lb/>forward, at future options and prospects, not only at historical performance. <lb/>Clarification exercise: In contrast to the assessment, review or stocktake processes, a clarification exercise aims <lb/>to allow for a better understanding of countries&apos; actions. It may be both a technical and political exercise, as it <lb/>would allow for clarifying questions from other countries. For example, individual Parties made presentations and <lb/>then responded to questions from other Parties under the work programme on clarifying developed country <lb/>targets, and the work programme on understanding developing country mitigation actions. <lb/>Technical vs. Political: Processes can either focus on more technical issues (e.g. similar to current reviews and <lb/>assessments of inventories and national communications) or be more &quot; political &quot; , often peer-to-peer exchanges <lb/>(e.g. similar to current international assessment or facilitative exchange of views). A political process is helpful <lb/>where objective assessments are challenging, and where no established assessment frameworks are in place. It can <lb/>be used to: better understand specific challenges and share experiences between countries; build trust; and create a <lb/>space for discussing political issues, such as ambition and fairness. Terms such as &quot; consideration &quot; , &quot; consultation &quot; , <lb/> &quot; facilitative dialogue &quot; and &quot; facilitate understanding &quot; may suggest political processes, though dialogue and peer-<lb/>to-peer processes can also be a venue for discussing or clarifying technical issues. <lb/></front>

			<body>Various multilateral review processes exist in other international regimes; some examples are <lb/>provided in Box 2. These focus on implementation of previously agreed commitments and do not seek <lb/>to influence their content, since the commitments themselves are negotiated rather than proposed by <lb/>each individual country. Most of these are neither constraining nor punitive. Where separate <lb/>compliance processes are in place, they can play a facilitative role, flagging issues that are likely to <lb/>develop into compliance problems. For example, issues identified under WTO Trade Policy Reviews <lb/>can be an indicator of issues brought up under the Dispute Settlement Process (Chaisse and <lb/>Chakraborty, 2007). An important question to consider is also that of resources: thorough assessment <lb/>and review processes are expensive, time-consuming and require expertise (Ellis et al., 2011; Halle, <lb/>Najam and Wolfe, 2014). Approximately half of the IMF&apos;s operating budget, for example, is devoted <lb/>to surveillance activities (Pew Center, 2010). <lb/>4.2 <lb/>Proposals contained within the draft agreement text <lb/>The draft agreement text (ADP, 2015a) proposes that NDMCs may be subject to various multilateral <lb/>processes. Some of these might examine NDMCs at a collective level (aggregation exercise and <lb/>global stocktake), and others at the individual level (clarification exercise; transparency system; <lb/>facilitative compliance and implementation system). Previously, the Geneva negotiating text <lb/>contained proposals for multilateral review or assessment processes that would explicitly aim to <lb/>influence or encourage greater ambition in NDMCs themselves, and some analysts suggested that <lb/>contributions or commitments be reviewed ex ante for this purpose, prior to their inscription and <lb/>implementation (Morgan, Dagnet and Tirpak, 2014). No such language is included in the current draft <lb/>agreement text. <lb/>Box 2: Multilateral review processes in other international regimes <lb/>Many other major multilateral processes that examine countries&apos; performances with meeting commitments and <lb/>obligations use &quot; reviews &quot; to do so (Pew Center, 2010; Bell et al., 2012). This includes: <lb/>• The IMF Bilateral Surveillance (in which the Secretariat&apos;s report includes recommendations)<lb/>• The UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review (under which countries are to implement <lb/>recommendations)<lb/>• The Montreal Protocol Implementation Review (where the Implementation Committee can issue <lb/>recommendations)<lb/>• The WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM)<lb/>The TPRM does not result in specific recommendations, but aims to provide a factual evaluation of progress with <lb/>national implementation of trade and investment policies, as well as their effectiveness and potential impact on the <lb/>multilateral trading system. It includes a consultation process in which countries can ask questions of the country <lb/>under review, which can be quite intense for major trading countries. The country must, within a specified <lb/>deadline, answer all questions put forward in writing (bearing in mind that major trading countries can receive <lb/>over a thousand questions), and a summary statement is prepared outlining the implicit assessment by the <lb/>country&apos;s trading partners, highlighting progress, areas of improvement, concerns and questions. <lb/>All of the above processes apply to all countries without distinction; flexibility is provided through less frequent <lb/>reviews in the case of the IMF bilateral surveillance and WTO TPRM (where frequency is based on share of world <lb/>trade). Under the Montreal Protocol, developing countries benefit from more flexible phase-out schedule for <lb/>controlled substances, but implementation remains subject to annual review. The Montreal Protocol review <lb/>process is both collective and individual. Individual country reports are reviewed and specific issues can be <lb/>referred to the Implementation Committee. At the same time, the Meeting of the Parties discusses collective, rather <lb/>than country specific, implementation of the Protocol. <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>The current draft agreement text does not propose a review or assessment process for communicated <lb/>NDMCs themselves; nor would the interval proposed between communication and finalisation in any <lb/>case appear sufficient for a Party to adjust its contributions or commitments during the interval. A <lb/>country could potentially, however, adjust its NDMC at any time, and may formally be encouraged to <lb/>do so every five years in the case of a regular communication cycle, though not within the context of <lb/>multilateral process allowing for feedback and reflection. <lb/>Only two multilateral processes mentioned in Article 3 of the draft agreement text on Mitigation <lb/>appear expected to have an impact on the content of successive NDMCs: the global stocktake (Article <lb/>10), a collective assessment, and the process to facilitate implementation (Article 11), which could <lb/>include individual assessments. These are potentially to be taken &quot; into account &quot; as part of the features <lb/>of a NDMC. <lb/>In terms of collective processes, an assessment of the aggregate effect of communicated NDMCs in <lb/>light of the temperature goal is proposed. The language used, &quot; production of an aggregate synthesis <lb/>report &quot; , suggests the recent synthesis report prepared by the UNFCCC Secretariat, examining the <lb/>aggregate effect of INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015b). Producing such a report in the future would be greatly <lb/>facilitated by greater clarity on NDMCs and the common use of metrics and accounting. The global <lb/>stocktake is presented in a separate article of the draft agreement, underlining its importance. The role <lb/>of the global stocktake will likely require some more detailed thinking. It is important because it links <lb/>aggregate longer-term goals with individual NDMCs, which are shorter term. Overall, such an <lb/>assessment would be greatly facilitated if individual countries also linked their NDMCs with their <lb/>own long-term low emission development strategies, or other relevant long-term development <lb/>strategies (e.g. sustainable development, green growth, poverty reduction). The use of non-GHG <lb/>metrics to track the actual drivers of low-emission development, as mentioned in Hood, Briner and <lb/>Rocha (2014), could be usefully integrated into NDCs, long-term strategies, and global assessments <lb/>(e.g. average emissions intensity of new power plants installed during the contribution period, <lb/>implementation of low-emission urban planning guidelines). Some design questions regarding a <lb/>global stocktake in relation to mitigation are presented in Table 3. <lb/>As described in the draft agreement text, the global stocktake would be a broad exercise, taking stock <lb/>of the implementation of the agreement, and assessing Parties&apos; progress with achieving the purpose of <lb/>the agreement. It may be difficult to determine whether and how to either combine or distinguish <lb/>mitigation and non-mitigation areas, such as the implementation of mitigation actions and their <lb/>effects, alongside progress with actions conditional on support, and the provision or mobilisation of <lb/>such support. Currently in non-mitigation areas, the UNFCCC&apos;s Standing Committee on Finance <lb/>(SCF) undertakes a biennial assessment on global climate finance flows, identifying gaps and areas <lb/>for further work (SCF, 2013). Ideas for a collective adaptation objective are being explored, as well as <lb/>how progress against this can be tracked in some way (UNEP, 2014; Magnan et al., 2014; Fisher and <lb/>Craft, 2015), despite this being both conceptually and practically challenging (Ellis and Helgeson, <lb/>2015). It is unclear how progress with any global objective would be assessed, but the Adaptation <lb/>Committee&apos;s current examination of how the Cancun Adaptation Framework has been implemented <lb/>might offer some lessons (UNFCCC, 2013). The monitoring of progress with implementing the UN <lb/>Sustainable Development Goals may also usefully provide a global stocktake of progress with <lb/>reducing risks and enhancing resilience 2 . The monitoring of global progress with the Sendai <lb/>Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, may also provide helpful inputs. <lb/></body>

Other than a <lb/> &quot; preparatory process &quot; to facilitate the clarity of communicated NDMCs, most multilateral processes <lb/>examining individual NDMCs could potentially provide insights and feedback to improve <lb/>implementation, and indirectly impact the content of successive NDMCs. Proposals for the <lb/>transparency system (Article 9) include provisions for review of progress made in implementing and <lb/>achieving nationally determined mitigation contributions or commitments. This would allow for <lb/>regular feedback on implementation, particularly if a biennial review process continued to be in place. <lb/>It is suggested that outcomes of a system to facilitate implementation, proposed in Article 11, be <lb/>accounted for in NDMCs. Review processes within such a system could also help with addressing <lb/>challenges that hinder achievement of NDMC objectives. Depending on how this was designed, it <lb/>might do so only on an ad hoc or irregular basis, when Parties have problems with implementation or <lb/>with fulfilling their NDMCs, rather than providing regular, in-depth assessment that might facilitate <lb/>enhanced national action. Table 4 provides an overview of some advantages and disadvantages <lb/>associated with proposed multilateral processes that may impact the dynamism and ambition of <lb/>NDMCs, whether in their development/revision or implementation. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Could help enhance <lb/>implementation, and provide <lb/>inputs into successive NDMCs. <lb/>Options in text include a less <lb/>robust system of limited reporting <lb/>for developing country Parties. <lb/>A strong transparency system, <lb/>that can provide individual <lb/>reviews useful for domestic <lb/>policy processes, is resource <lb/>intensive. <lb/>Compliance and <lb/>implementation <lb/>system <lb/>A body would review <lb/>implementation and/or <lb/>compliance; assist in finding ways <lb/>to improve implementation <lb/>(developing countries), make <lb/>specific recommendations <lb/>(developed countries). <lb/>Country-specific assessment and <lb/>recommendations to assist <lb/>countries with implementation <lb/>challenges; could help identify <lb/>more specific areas where greater <lb/>capacity or resources are needed. <lb/>As an ad-hoc mechanism, <lb/>wouldn&apos;t provide regular <lb/>technical assessments that might <lb/>encourage enhanced <lb/>implementation and potential <lb/>over-achievement of NDMCs. <lb/>* As presented in the draft agreement text (ADP, 2015a). <lb/>The INDCs submitted in the course of 2015 may be subject to different multilateral processes, given <lb/>they were developed in the absence of a common framework and guidelines, and often in relatively <lb/>short time periods. The draft decision to accompany the agreement includes, for example, the option <lb/>19 <lb/>that INDCs undergo a clarification exercise after which they may be finalised, that the secretariat&apos;s <lb/>synthesis report on INDCs be updated, or that a facilitative dialogue take stock of collective progress <lb/>with INDCs in relation to long-term goals (ADP, 2015a). Proposals for different ways of accelerating <lb/>implementation of pre-2020 commitments, contained within the draft decision on workstream 2, could <lb/>also potentially lead to new assessments and revisions of post-2020 contributions and commitments <lb/>(ADP, 2015b). Experience with the potential future assessment and revision of INDCs could helpfully <lb/>feed into the design of procedures and processes for post-2020 NDCs and NDMCs. <lb/>At the individual country level, once a policy or programme is agreed nationally, it can be difficult for <lb/>this to be modified or adjusted in any significant way. This is because it is often the fruit of much <lb/>debate, negotiation and compromise at the domestic level. The advantage of an international cycle is <lb/>that it can trigger a process to launch or revise climate policy, no matter what the country&apos;s starting <lb/>point is, and this at regular intervals. Rather than a dedicated review process for the contribution or <lb/>commitment, the current ADP draft agreement text suggests that the transparency system, and <lb/>potentially a facilitative implementation and compliance system, could provide regular reviews and <lb/>assessments. These could potentially seek to encourage and facilitate greater ambition. Existing <lb/>reporting and review processes could be used as a basis, though it is likely that they would need to be <lb/>modified to fulfil this function (Ellis and Moarif, 2015). <lb/>Understandably, countries may be uncomfortable deciding on individual reviews and assessments that <lb/>may need to be revised or introduced as part of the transparency system, or as part of the compliance <lb/>and implementation mechanism. Countries will wish to know what processes their NDMCs may be <lb/>subject to. It is therefore important to clarify different understandings of what any individual <lb/>assessment and review process(es) would entail; a set of key questions is presented in Table 5. <lb/>Table 5. Key questions for individual assessment or review process <lb/>Key questions <lb/>Observations <lb/>1. What is being assessed or reviewed? Politically sensitive. Decisions needed on scope, whether process will <lb/>look at effort or impact, both, or neither (e.g. absolute GHG levels). <lb/>Will need flexibility to ensure broad participation and a process that is <lb/>useful for all countries. <lb/>2. Which Parties are being assessed or <lb/>reviewed? <lb/>Given nature of 2015 agreement, likely that all Parties subject to some <lb/>process, though with flexibility. <lb/>3. By whom? (which bodies or <lb/>institutions?) <lb/>Will depend on scope and substance of process(es); likely involve an <lb/>expanded Roster of experts. <lb/>4. Through what processes will the <lb/>review(s) or assessment(s) take place? <lb/>Can be determined once purposes and outcomes are clarified. Should <lb/>build as much as possible on existing practice, processes, and <lb/>institutions. <lb/>5. What criteria will be used to assess <lb/>or review relevant actions, <lb/>contributions, and objectives? <lb/>Politically sensitive. Ideally the assessment framework would be <lb/>flexible and evolve over time, would be useful to countries, and link <lb/>to longer-term objectives (individual and collective). Could be <lb/>minimal, such as meeting reporting requirements as set out in specific <lb/>guidelines. <lb/>6. What happens if the criteria are not <lb/>met? (what outcomes?) <lb/>Politically sensitive. It is unlikely outcomes will be punitive; various <lb/>facilitative outcomes may be feasible. It is also possible that the <lb/>answer to this question changes over time, or varies according to the <lb/>scope of review. <lb/>7. What outputs will stem from the <lb/>assessment or review? <lb/>A written record of any processes is likely necessary and could be <lb/>useful. Outputs can be produced by different actors, e.g. Secretariat, <lb/>Party undergoing process, external experts, etc. Quantity and nature of <lb/>output can have resource implications. <lb/>8. When would the assessment or <lb/>review occur? <lb/>Depends on answer to question (1), as well as logistical feasibility, <lb/>e.g. data availability, timing of other related processes (reporting <lb/>requirements, global stocktake, etc.). <lb/>Source: Adapted from Halle, Najam and Wolfe (2014). <lb/>20 <lb/>A simplified diagram of multilateral processes within a cycle of commitments or contributions is <lb/>presented in Figure 1, based on the proposals currently contained in the ADP draft agreement text. <lb/>Processes with dashed outlines are those that are potential options in the current agreement text, while <lb/>dotted lines represent potential lines of influence: the text suggests that the global stocktake, at a <lb/>minimum, should aim to guide individual country actions. Regular assessment and review processes <lb/>could play a role in influencing successive NDMCs, as well as the implementation of contributions or <lb/>commitments. These interactions could either be formalised, i.e. stipulated as explicit objectives of a <lb/>given process, or could be informal. Assessment and review processes can be thought of as <lb/>opportunities for feedback and reflection, aligning with moments within a cycle when countries have <lb/>the opportunity to adjust or update their NDMCs. <lb/>Figure 1. Options for international assessment and review processes within a NDMC cycle <lb/>5. Conclusions <lb/>Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) put forward by Parties are at the centre of a new <lb/>agreement to be adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change <lb/>(UNFCCC) in 2015. Provisions for the ambition and dynamism of nationally determined mitigation <lb/>contributions or commitments (NDMCs) are primarily contained in two options: first, that NDMCs be <lb/>more ambitious over time, and represent a Party&apos;s highest level of ambition; second, the proposal that <lb/>NDMCs are communicated at regular intervals, every five years (ADP, 2015a). NDMCs could also be <lb/>bolstered by one or more multilateral processes, primarily a global stocktake that would help countries <lb/>see whether their contributions are consistent with collectively-agreed climate objectives. The passage <lb/>of a national contribution through these processes is referred to as a &quot; cycle &quot; . Focusing on mitigation, <lb/>this paper has clarified certain concepts contained in the revised draft agreement and decision text, <lb/>and highlighted key questions to guide decisions on such a cycle. <lb/></div>

			<note place="footnote">In the very short term, at the 21 st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in December, Parties will need <lb/>to set the framework for the procedures and processes applied to NDMCs. The framework outlined in <lb/>the draft agreement and decision texts contains options for NDMCs to meet specific features (e.g. that <lb/>they become more ambitious over time) and technical requirements (e.g. use realistic and meaningful <lb/>reference values, maintaining baselines). It also proposes a common timeframe for the communication <lb/>of NDMCs (every five years), and multilateral processes related to NDMCs (clarification exercise and <lb/>aggregation, and global stocktake). <lb/>After Paris, more detailed consideration will be needed of procedures and multilateral processes that <lb/>impact the dynamism and ambition of NDCs and NDMCs. Parties will need to ensure there is a <lb/>common understanding of what these elements mean, and how they will be implemented. This <lb/>includes the aim of the clarification exercise, the role of the transparency system, and that of a future <lb/>Implementation <lb/>Communication <lb/>Finalisation <lb/>Communication <lb/>Domestic <lb/>process <lb/>Domestic <lb/>process <lb/>Cycle 1 <lb/>Cycle 2 <lb/>Consideration <lb/>exercise <lb/>(individual) <lb/>Aggregation <lb/>exercise <lb/>(collective) <lb/>Transparency <lb/>system (MRV) <lb/>Facilitative <lb/>compliance <lb/>system <lb/>Global <lb/>stocktake <lb/>(collective) <lb/></note>

			<body>facilitative compliance and implementation system. The global stocktake, meant to assess <lb/>implementation and progress for all elements of the agreement, will need to be more clearly defined. <lb/>It would somehow need to consider overall implementation of mitigation, adaptation and means of <lb/>implementation provisions, while also taking into account the specificities of each issue. Future global <lb/>stocktakes could potentially draw on the experience of the Standing Committee on Finance, the <lb/>Adaptation Committee&apos;s ongoing work to examine progress with implementation of the Cancun <lb/>Adaptation Framework, the 2013-15 Review, as well as various external stocktaking processes (e.g. <lb/>UNEP gap reports, implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, Sendai framework, IPCC, <lb/>etc.). <lb/>Clarity on any international procedures and processes applying to NDMCs will be needed rapidly. <lb/>This will enable countries to understand and feel comfortable with any assessment, review and <lb/>stocktake processes they establish going forward, and can legally formalise the 2015 agreement as <lb/>early as possible ahead of 2020. In particular, countries will need to understand: <lb/>• when multilateral processes will take place; <lb/>• their aim, i.e. whether they will be assessments, reviews, or other facilitative exchanges;<lb/>• their scope, i.e. if they apply to individual countries or in aggregate;<lb/>• what needs to be developed as stand-alone processes (e.g. global stocktake), what can be <lb/>integrated into current transparency systems or a future facilitative implementation <lb/>mechanism (e.g. review of implementation), and what could build on existing review <lb/>processes (e.g. the review of the long-term global goal) ; <lb/> • what inputs they need (with potential implications for transparency systems); and<lb/>• what the outcomes of these processes might be.<lb/>As part of a cycle of mitigation contributions or commitments, Parties would require appropriate <lb/>resources devoted to the type of assessment and review processes that could usefully facilitate NDMC <lb/>implementation, and provide confidence to all that Parties are making progress. Such processes, <lb/>which ideally need to link any assessment and recommendations to domestic decision-making <lb/>processes, tend to be resource intensive and require expertise. Existing assessment and review <lb/>processes may need to be adapted to better match the timing of NDMC implementation periods, and <lb/>any new information needs raised by the global stocktake. <lb/>At COP21, Parties might also need to decide on the status of INDCs submitted in the course of 2015. <lb/>Namely, on whether and how they may have the opportunity for international review, assessment or <lb/>consultation (even if it may be different in nature than the process outlined as part of the agreement), <lb/>particularly given that some countries have already indicated they will be revising or updating their <lb/>INDCs. <lb/>Under an international agreement, it is essential that specific national mitigation contributions or <lb/>commitments put forward be achieved (and ideally overachieved), and that progress with meeting <lb/>these objectives be tracked. While contributions or commitments will be nationally determined, <lb/>international procedures and processes that carry these through a &quot; cycle &quot; can help support and <lb/>encourage increases in ambition over time. Over the next few years, Parties will need to agree on the <lb/>technical details of such processes so these are functional from 2020. In doing so, the domestic <lb/>benefits of well-designed international processes should be kept in mind. Systems that integrate <lb/>reviews, assessments and consultations between Parties all offer opportunities to emphasise, highlight <lb/>and encourage consistency with longer-term sustainable development pathways. <lb/></body>
