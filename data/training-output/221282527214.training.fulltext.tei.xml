			<p>This paper discusses a number of issues arising from the contiguous development of public and<lb/> private quality standards, predominately in developed countries. The paper is an exploratory examination<lb/> of the ways in which public and private food quality standards interact with each other in modern food<lb/> systems. This review is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of the subject matter which is a<lb/> relatively new area of research. The focus of the report is on food quality standards which are defined here<lb/> as including the full array of food product and process attributes required by consumers and society as well<lb/> as food safety. Food safety is clearly an integral part of food quality at least to the extent that food safety is<lb/> a basic prerequisite for any quality attribute. However, food safety has very different requirements than<lb/> other food quality attributes. Food safety is essentially a &quot; public good &quot; because safe food is a basic<lb/> requirement of any food system to ensure trust in the food supply. It is traditionally seen as a sovereign<lb/> responsibility of the government to provide regulations, usually compulsory food safety standards as a<lb/> basis for guaranteeing that food on offer is safe when delivered to consumers. Due to the presence of<lb/> externalities, informational asymmetries and public goods characteristics, markets alone will generally not<lb/> provide the socially desirable amount of food safety. Hence it is assumed here that the competence for food<lb/> safety standards remains a public sector responsibility and outside the ambit of the discussion in the paper<lb/> concerning the interaction of public and private food quality standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>The report is based on a review of the literature, from which it becomes evident that research on the<lb/> relations and inter-linkages between public and private standards in national food quality systems and<lb/> international trade is still very much in its infancy. However, it is clearly apparent that systems of food<lb/> quality control are evolving with increasingly complex interaction between public and private modes of<lb/> food quality regulation. Government oversight of food quality has increased substantially in many<lb/> countries over the last decade including the introduction of more stringent ex ante direct regulations and<lb/> ex post indirect controls. In addition, private protocols and mechanisms have developed rapidly and now<lb/> play an increasingly important role in the supply of higher quality food. The result is an increasingly<lb/> complex network of both public and private standards to assure the increasing quality of products on offer<lb/> in agricultural and food markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the same time, public food standards are being subject to closer scrutiny in the WTO and<lb/> elsewhere in terms of their scientific justification and economic efficiency, which, in turn, is influencing<lb/> the course of the progression. Historically, the public sector was involved with setting standards for<lb/> product grades, weights and measures used in arms length transactions for mass markets composed of<lb/> largely homogenous agricultural commodities. Grades and standards in these markets have many of the<lb/> characteristics of public goods and will remain predominately in the public domain. Public food quality<lb/> regulations are, in general, becoming more performance and process based, placing greater responsibility<lb/> on private food companies to implement effective food quality controls. In turn, private food quality<lb/> standards have emerged to mitigate regulatory and reputational risks faced by private food businesses, and<lb/> are increasingly being employed to facilitate competitive positioning in higher value food markets, through<lb/> product differentiation based on an increasing array of food quality attributes.<lb/> As advances in science, increases in wealth and evolving societal concerns with respect to the<lb/> environment, sustainability and animal welfare put greater focus on a wider range of food quality<lb/> attributes, both private firms and public institutions find themselves responding increasingly to consumer<lb/> and societal demands for higher food quality. However, private and social interests are often distinct and<lb/> an efficient food quality control system operated from a private business perspective may not yield socially<lb/> efficient outcomes. Firms have incentives to provide high quality food in order to gain competitive<lb/> advantage, but in cases where information available to consumers on which to judge food quality is<lb/> imperfect, market and legal incentives may be insufficient to give consumers the level of quality and<lb/> protection that society as a whole would like. In such cases of information asymmetries and externalities,<lb/> governments continue to play an important role in correcting market failures by enacting minimum food<lb/> quality regulations. In the case of experience and credence goods, consumers rely to a large extent on<lb/> public standards and quality signalling to ensure the quality of food products provided in the market. This<lb/> reflects both the difficulty they face to evaluate food product quality in such instances or to take recourse<lb/> against suppliers if the product turns out not to meet their expectations. However, this does not necessarily<lb/> imply that mandatory regulations or quality standards are required in all circumstances. Governments may<lb/> instead introduce voluntary standards and seek compliance with such quality standards. For a voluntary<lb/> standards approach to be successful, the government must be prepared to follow up by imposing<lb/> mandatory standards if adequate food quality compliance is not achieved with voluntary standards. But<lb/> where practices by producers can have serious effects on the well-being of consumers, governments often<lb/> decide to take preventive action to rule out such possibilities. In these incidences, the government will<lb/> choose mandatory standards.<lb/> In circumstances where adequate information is available to consumers or can be found by them on<lb/> the quality attributes of a food product, the role of mandatory standards is more questionable. For search<lb/> attributes of food quality, the market will normally provide efficient incentives for producers to provide<lb/> food quality even in the absence of mandatory standards or a well-functioning product liability system.<lb/> Despite the economic arguments in favour of voluntary controls, it is noteworthy that traditional mandatory<lb/> regulatory systems still tend to predominate in many national and regional food regulatory systems,<lb/> compared to incentive based voluntary instruments of control.<lb/></p>

			<p>Producer and consumer interests may also differ in the domain of international trade. While domestic<lb/> agricultural and food producers have an interest to set standards so as to provide them with a competitive<lb/> advantage over imports, this is not necessarily in the interest of consumers. This argument may be less<lb/> valid in the case of globally operating food retailers and food service firms. With the creation of the WTO<lb/> and Sanitary and Photo Sanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreements establishing<lb/> clear rules on the applications of standards by member countries to minimise any negative trade effects,<lb/> governments now face increased scrutiny to ensure that standards are not introduced for the purpose of<lb/> trade protection. The initial results in terms of disputes brought to the WTO would suggest that the WTO<lb/> processes, particularly in relation to SPS matters, are having some degree of success in reducing trade<lb/> protection resulting from the imposition of public standards.<lb/> Private voluntary standards can also affect trade. In a world where private standards predominate in<lb/> global supply chains controlled by multinational food companies, a key issue for a food exporter or<lb/> supplier is to gain access to the global value chain. With a diminishing number of leading retailers and<lb/> global food businesses due to industry consolidation and concentration trends, there is greater scope for<lb/> exclusion from entire markets if private standards laying down conditions of entry are not met. By the<lb/> same token, for those exporters who do gain access to these global value chains, the benefits in terms of<lb/> trade relations can be substantial. Standards can thus have a catalytic effect in opening up trade<lb/> opportunities for such exporters. However, the evolution of private standards does not imply that public<lb/> regulatory standards will disappear. Exporters will still need to demonstrate compliance with public<lb/> standards to gain entry to national markets. What it does suggest, however, is that there will likely be<lb/> economic gains from closer co-ordination of public and private standards and related control systems. An<lb/> example is provided by dairy industries in EU member states which have reached common agreement to<lb/> harmonised standards on quality of dairy products across member states and then EU wide standards are<lb/> set by the European Commission. Another example at the regional level of the benefits of such<lb/> coordination is provided by the Rapid Alert System in the EU that was established in cooperation with<lb/> private industry food retailers and distributors to rapidly remove products from retailer shelves if quality<lb/> problems are detected.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the increasing globalisation of food supply chains, both systems are being influenced by trade<lb/> agreements in the WTO and by the work of international food quality standardisation organisations. While<lb/> this is leading to increased transparency of public regulatory processes, one concern is that a similar level<lb/> of transparency may not apply to private standards and their associated control and enforcement processes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mix between public and private food quality standards continues to evolve. There appears to be<lb/> some movement towards a separation of standards and food regulation in developed countries, with the<lb/> former the domain of private firms and the later that of public agencies. Direct regulation is placing more<lb/> emphasis on company level responsibility. Private standards and market forces related to market<lb/> segmentation and higher returns to a firm&apos;s reputation tend to reinforce this development. The shift of<lb/> responsibilities towards the private sector has created a more complex policy space involving public and<lb/> private sector incentives and controls. In this situation, public regulatory agencies need to be more aware<lb/> of their actions in the context of evolving private modes of food quality management as the way in which<lb/> public standards are developed can act to augment market-based incentives to invest in enhanced food<lb/> quality and supply chain controls.<lb/> From this brief review of the literature it would appear that while private food quality standards are<lb/> often higher, more flexible and agile in responding to a wide range of continually evolving consumer<lb/> preferences for food quality than public quality standards enforced by single nations on their domestic food<lb/> supply or as a result of international negotiations (Codex); overall, public and private food quality<lb/> standards tend to be complementary. In many cases private standards build on the existing public standard<lb/> infrastructure to provide an element of competition through quality differentiation. Public standards are<lb/> still necessary to correct market failures associated with information asymmetries or consumption<lb/> externalities and where standards have clearly public good characteristics. Public standards will, therefore,<lb/> continue to play a dominant role in establishing basic grades and standards for mass markets composed of<lb/> largely homogenous agricultural products to create economies of scale and for ensuring minimum<lb/> standards of a safe food supply as well as to prevent fraud or quality deception of consumers. They also<lb/> have a global role in assuring that basic standards are consistent across countries and with those that are<lb/> required to be met (SPS, TBT) in cross border trade. Private standards may play a substitute role in<lb/> situations where there is an absence of effective public standards to provide a measure of food quality for<lb/> consumers. Alternatively, private standards have emerged despite the existence of strong public food<lb/> quality standards as a means to differentiate products, reflecting the growing role of quality as the mode of<lb/> competition in agricultural and food markets, as well as to facilitate effective coordination of expansive<lb/> buyer supply chains. In certain circumstances, private standards can also act to facilitate compliance with<lb/> public standards to allow for better targeting of scarce compliance resources. In markets for differentiated<lb/> products and to meet requirements of niche markets (including for product liability), food companies may<lb/> choose to exceed public standards with higher private standards. In this way, private and public standards<lb/> can be mutually reinforcing, contributing to total system efficacy and resulting in higher quality food being<lb/> available in national and global markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>A.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Contemporary agri-food systems are increasingly pervaded by an array of inter-related public and<lb/> private standards. These are becoming a mandatory part of doing business in supply chains for processed<lb/> food products, beyond basic bulk commodities [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. Governments have<lb/> traditionally played the major role in establishing minimum food quality standards and regulations for their<lb/> populations. This recognises a degree of government responsibility for food quality issues to ensure,<lb/> amongst other things, the availability of safe food 1 for the population at large and to protect consumers<lb/> from deceptive and fraudulent practices<lb/></p>

			<p>Standards continue to evolve in response to changes in technology, scientific developments regarding<lb/> the risks associated with food and directly in response to consumer and societal demands. They have<lb/> proliferated and diversified their coverage over time as societal activities have become more complex. At<lb/> the same time, structural and institutional evolutions based on private control systems and enforcement<lb/> procedures are taking place in the agri-food sector of many developed countries in conjunction with trends<lb/> in consumer demand that have increased the role of private voluntary standards in food chains. The wider<lb/> use of private standards is refocusing agricultural and food supply chains from price-based to quality-based<lb/> centres of competition [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. Quality food standards are now increasingly seen as<lb/> private goods that differentiate food products and are increasingly in the domain of private firms. Public<lb/> standards and regulatory controls have also evolved over time in most countries around the world, and<lb/> have become ever more stringent and complex as consumers demand specific attributes or disclosure of<lb/> information about certain attributes of food <ref type="biblio">[Josling et al., 2004]</ref>.<lb/> Increasingly, supply chains for food products are extending beyond national borders, facilitated in part<lb/> by new processed food products and a policy environment more supportive of international food trade.<lb/> Minimum quality standards while protecting the consumer often do not allow food retail businesses, food<lb/> service companies and processing firms in a contemporary food system to differentiate their products<lb/> based on quality attributes to protect and gain market share when competing in national and regional<lb/> markets 2 . As a consequence, private standards have emerged to fill this gap and to respond to regulatory<lb/> developments. In general, these are based on coordinated systems for meeting consumer demand for<lb/> quality attributes based on product differentiation and market segmentation <ref type="biblio">[Fulponi, 2006]</ref>. As private<lb/> food companies and retail businesses expand across the world and develop local and global supply chains,<lb/> they set standards for the quality of foods they will purchase from suppliers and sell to consumers. These<lb/> standards may be higher and more demanding than the minimum standards enforced by governments in<lb/> their national markets. However, private standards as a fairly recent phenomenon are not yet universally<lb/> applied with public standards still the dominant form of control in the food systems of some countries.<lb/> Given these developments, many questions arise as to the relationship between public and private<lb/> standards in the modern food system. With the growing importance of private voluntary standards that are<lb/> often set at higher levels, more frequently adjusted and applied to more varied areas than government<lb/> 1<lb/></p>

			<p>Food safety is clearly an integral part of food quality at least to the extent that food safety is a basic prerequisite for<lb/> any quality attribute. However, food safety has very different requirements than other food quality attributes. Food<lb/> safety is essentially a &quot; public good &quot; because safe food is a basic requirement of any food system to ensure trust in the<lb/> food supply. It is traditionally seen as a sovereign responsibility of the government to provide regulations,<lb/> usually compulsory food safety standards as a basis for guaranteeing that food on offer is safe when delivered to<lb/> consumers. Due to the presence of externalities, informational asymmetries and public goods characteristics, markets<lb/> alone will generally not provide the socially desirable amount of food safety. Hence it is assumed here that the<lb/> competence for food safety standards remains a public sector responsibility and outside the ambit of the discussion in<lb/> the paper concerning the interaction of public and private food quality standards.<lb/> standards, the question that arises is what is the role of government standards and food regulations? Can<lb/> decisions on standards by individual private firms be relied on to yield outcomes that coincide with broader<lb/> public policy goals? A related question is whether existing standard setting arrangements are conducive to<lb/> aligning public and private outcomes? Are public standards still required and for what purposes? Would<lb/> private quality standards be lower in the absence of minimum public food quality standards?<lb/></p>

			<p>This report aims to throw light on such questions at the interface between public and private food<lb/> standards in modern food chains through a selective review of the extensive literature that is available. The<lb/> focus is on the role played by public and private standards in contemporary food systems, their evolving<lb/> relations and how they interact with each other (i.e. complement, substitute, conflict or convergent) in<lb/> establishing incentives for food suppliers to provide high quality food in national and international food<lb/> markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the economic concepts of relevance to standards<lb/> as a lead in to the types and definitions of food standards in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the rationale for<lb/> government food regulations or public standards. The factors explaining the emergence and growing<lb/> prominence of private voluntary standards are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 extends the discussion of<lb/> standards to take in the international trade dimension. A final section attempts to draw the threads of the<lb/> discussion together on the different roles and interactions between public and private standards in national<lb/> and global food systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>B.<lb/> The economics of food quality standards<lb/></head>

			<p>The economic literature on standards as initially conceived identified the provision of information and<lb/> compatibility, or the network externalities approach, as being the driving force for standardisation [<ref type="biblio">Katz<lb/> and Shapiro, 1985]</ref>. Economic gains accrue due to positive network effects which arise when the value of a<lb/> good to a user increases the more other users adopt the same good or compatible ones <ref type="biblio">[Becker, 1999]</ref>.<lb/> Classic examples of positive network externalities are telephones and fax machines, whose value to an<lb/> individual user increases with the number of users connected to the service. Much of the focus of the<lb/> economic literature in the area of food standards has been on the role of public food quality standards both<lb/> as policy instruments for regulating food markets and as potential non-tariff measures, although more<lb/> attention is now being given to the growing role of private food quality standards in the food supply chain<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>.<lb/> In this section the economics of standards is discussed in the context of food quality. Food quality<lb/> standards have been selected for several reasons. Firstly, with rising incomes and higher standards of<lb/> living, consumers generally have become more demanding and fragmented in their food choices. Private<lb/> food standards have emerged in part to respond to this need, with a shift to quality competition based on<lb/> product differentiation in terms of quality of food products and away from price-based competition among<lb/> firms. Secondly, agri-food products are characterised by considerable variability and heterogeneity that<lb/> create uncertainty for consumers on the different attributes that make up food product quality. As food<lb/> quality depends crucially on objective characteristics of products as well as individual subjective<lb/> preferences, quality per se is difficult to define. 3 Two different analytical conceptions are used in the<lb/> literature on food quality. 4 The consumer behaviour literature favours the consumer perceived quality or<lb/> 3<lb/></p>

			<p>The International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) has developed a definition of food quality that has been widely<lb/> used. Quality is defined as the &quot; totality of features and characteristics of a product that bear on its ability to satisfy<lb/> stated or implied needs &quot; However, this definition is so general it is not useful for analytical purposes<lb/> 4<lb/></p>

			<p>The two analytical approaches are potentially contradictory as is evident in the case of the beef hormones issue<lb/> between the US and EU. While the European Union is in favour of the perceived quality approach, the US takes the<lb/> view that no scientific evidence is available to confirm (EU) consumer perceptions that hormone treated beef is of<lb/> inferior quality and hence no justification for an EU ban on such imports which is in violation of the WTO rules.<lb/> attribute approach, while the food science literature emphasises the measurable quality approach based on<lb/> objective product quality <ref type="biblio">[Bowbrick, 1992]</ref>. In the case of the former approach, product quality, in<lb/> following Lancaster <ref type="biblio">[1966]</ref>, is seen as a bundle of attributes or characteristics or properties that determine a<lb/> products performance. Major categories of food product quality attributes include food nutrition, organo-<lb/>leptic characteristics (colour/appearance, taste, texture, odour and other sensory characteristics, etc.) and<lb/> process attributes covering such things as organic production, dolphin-safe, animal welfare conditions,<lb/> GMO-free, environment preservation and worker conditions <ref type="biblio">[Brunsø et al., 2002]</ref>.<lb/> Consumers are assumed to use cues and signals to detect attributes they wish to consume <ref type="biblio">[Becker,<lb/> 1999]</ref>. A distinction is usually made between intrinsic and extrinsic cues. The former refers to the physical<lb/> properties of the food product and extrinsic cues refer basically to everything else <ref type="biblio">[Grunert, 2005]</ref>. Intrinsic<lb/> cues such as colour, appearance, size and smell, are used to predict attributes such as eating quality and<lb/> taste. Among the range of extrinsic cues, three have received special attention in the literature as possible<lb/> quality indicators or signals to consumers. These include product brands, indicators related to a product&apos;s<lb/> origin and quality labels. In the normal course of events, consumers choose foods within the context of a<lb/> total diet in order to obtain greater expected utility from their food. Consumers with different risk<lb/> preferences choose different bundles of foods. If their expectations of the quality attributes of foods (such<lb/> as risks or health hazards associated with certain food products) are not satisfied, consumers suffer a loss<lb/> of utility. On the supply side, food producers will supply food quality if it is profitable for them to do so, or<lb/> if they are required to do so. The higher profitability may arise from increased product differentiation and<lb/> sales to niche markets or from avoidance of losses with costly procedures and associated financial liability<lb/> in the event that quality is not maintained. The market outcome for quality is thus determined in the usual<lb/> way by the supply of characteristics and the demand for attributes and the information that consumers have<lb/> on these attributes [<ref type="biblio">Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]</ref>.<lb/> In general, the market for food quality can be characterised by a rising supply (marginal cost) curve<lb/> and a declining demand (marginal benefit) curve [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Traill, 1993; Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]</ref>.<lb/> Under perfect market conditions, these schedules intersect at a particular market clearing price providing<lb/> the optimum level of food quality. This scenario assumes that all market participants are fully informed<lb/> about the nature of the product on offer, buyers and sellers are essentially price-takers and that market<lb/> prices reflect all the costs and benefits to society. In such a situation, market prices will transmit all<lb/> necessary information, externalities will not arise and government regulation is not required <ref type="biblio">[Caswell and<lb/> Mojduszka, 1996]</ref>. In these circumstances, a variety of products of different qualities will be offered for<lb/> sale in the market at different prices. However, the market for food quality is often far from perfect. The<lb/> more important imperfections arise from asymmetry in information with sellers usually being better<lb/> informed about quality than buyers. In addition, since it is often difficult if not impossible for buyers to tell<lb/> the difference between good and bad (credence) quality products prior to purchase, this situation provides<lb/> incentives for sellers to promise high quality products but to sell low quality products in their place,<lb/> leading to adverse selection as pointed out by Akerlof <ref type="biblio">[1970]</ref>. Consumers may also have misconceptions<lb/> about the risks associated with consuming certain foods (externalities) and information about food quality<lb/> may have public good characteristics. In this situation, food quality may be under or over-supplied<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Minimum Quality Standards<lb/></head>

			<p>In an overall market context, the economic role of information provides the basic element for understanding the<lb/> importance of standards in the food system. Standards can, in general, improve consumer&apos;s information about product<lb/> quality. As a result, confidence rises and there is an overall increase in demand. Minimum standards may be used in<lb/> situations of imperfect information. In the literature, the theoretical discussion considers &apos;minimum quality standards&apos;<lb/> (MQS) as a minimum that can be applied to any attribute, but the economic reasoning remains the same.<lb/></p>

			<p>With imperfect information, regulatory agencies may set minimum quality standards (MQS). Most often MQS are<lb/> used to increase the qualities of goods produced and consumed, though there remains debate on their final effects.<lb/> When governments set MQS this is usually done for consumption externality reasons where free market qualities may<lb/> be considered insufficient. When governments implement minimum quality standards for some products or process<lb/> characteristic, this reduces the quality difference between firms (as nothing less than the minimum quality is allowed to<lb/> be sold) and increases price competition. In this situation, competing firms may decide to increase their quality<lb/> standard of a given attribute in order to relax price competition. But differences in quality between firms are never fully<lb/> restored to levels that existed prior to government standard setting, so prices fall or increase less and welfare rises<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Ronnen, 1991; Gal-Or, 1997)]</ref>.<lb/> 1 Authors such as Leland, <ref type="biblio">[1979]</ref>, Shapiro, <ref type="biblio">[1983]</ref>, argue that regulatory MQS are not<lb/> sufficient to raise the consumption quality of consumers, since many already consume above the minimum standard<lb/> and other consumers might be driven out of the market as prices rise.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the food sector there has been widespread use of minimum quality standards on products and processes<lb/> related to consumption attributes, such as organic or free range.<lb/> 2 In order to build and maintain reputation as high<lb/> quality sellers, or to keep customer loyalty and to earn premiums, sellers may decide to set quality levels above MQS.<lb/> Some suggest that this behaviour is a response to consumer demands for higher quality by those willing to pay for it<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al, 2000; Ecchia and Lambertini, 1997; Boom, 1995; Crampes and Hollander 1995]</ref>. This may also explain why<lb/> specific high quality product lines in food retailing are set up, such as Tesco&apos;s Nature&apos;s choice, Carrefour&apos;s Fillière de<lb/> Qualité or Loblaw&apos;s President&apos;s choice. An increase in private standards above MQS raises the question of the<lb/> economic or strategic motivation of firms. Is it a new way to compete, a way to insure against possible quality failures,<lb/> a strategy to pre-empt government regulations or simply to influence the regulatory outcomes?<lb/> One strategy is to pre-empt public regulations. Individual firms or a group of firms may decide to exceed existing<lb/> standards if, in doing so, they can influence future regulations. The timing of government and firm decisions is again<lb/> important <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al, 2000]</ref>. If firms decide to adopt a standard above current and expected minimum levels before<lb/> government takes action, then regulators may be influenced to set lower MSQ than they would have done otherwise.<lb/> Under this formulation, food companies may have undertaken substantial investments in machinery and equipment or<lb/> other supply logistics to ensure their specific private standard is achieved and adopted. Governments may be unwilling<lb/> to increase costs to firms with adverse consequences for prices or employment levels, if they set different minimum<lb/> standards. Such a pre-emptive strategy may, however, reduce social welfare compared to a situation where the<lb/> government would have moved first. <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al, 2000]</ref>. This situation can arise where MQS hitherto did not exist. In the<lb/> food sector this could possibly be the case for process attributes such as animal friendly and environmentally friendly<lb/> production processes. In certain cases, firms may over-comply or exceed required standards in order to further<lb/> enhance their reputation for offering high quality products in niche markets. Since over compliance may increase<lb/> reputation and market returns, public knowledge of a firm&apos;s behavior provide incentives to over-comply <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al,<lb/> 2002; Boom, 1995]</ref>.<lb/> 1. These results are obtained in imperfectly competitive markets where sellers can set prices rather than act in the price taker<lb/> situation discussed in Leland and Shapiro. Ronnen finds that competition in qualities relaxes price competition: To alleviate the effects<lb/> of the more intense price competition on their revenues, sellers of high quality products raise their quality in response to the sellers of<lb/> low quality products that have been forced to raise their quality to the mandated minimum quality level. Consequently, if variable costs<lb/> do not rise &apos;too quickly&apos; with quality, prices corrected for quality fall <ref type="biblio">[Ronnen, 1991 p. 503]</ref>.<lb/> 2. When minimum standards are set exogenously, they may not be optimal. The optimal standard is found by balancing the benefits<lb/> accruing to consumers of high quality and losses to those who would purchase a good at a quality below the minimum. Regulatory<lb/> agencies set minimum standards for goods where inferior qualities might have negative impacts on society<lb/></p>

			<p>Economists have frequently classified goods into three categories that signal the degree of information<lb/> available to consumers when buying them. The first category is search goods. For search goods or<lb/> attributes, consumers are able to ascertain visually a product&apos;s attributes before they purchase and consume<lb/> it by inspecting or researching the product. There is no quality uncertainty given careful pre-purchase<lb/> inspection and assuming that the cost of search is negligible. This is a full information situation. In the case<lb/> of experience goods or attributes, consumers are only able to determine a product&apos;s quality after they<lb/> purchase and consume it. Allowing for repeated purchases, the experience attribute can be used to<lb/> eliminate any quality uncertainty that may exist in the minds of consumers.<ref type="biblio">[Nelson, 1970]</ref> Credence<lb/> attributes denote those quality features of a product which are important to the consumer but which are<lb/> unable to be determined even after consumption [<ref type="biblio">Darby and Karni, 1973</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Andersen and Philipsen, 1998]</ref>.<lb/> In practice, a single food product could embody attributes that fit all three types of goods. For example, in<lb/> selecting a tomato in a fruit and vegetable stall, one could &quot; search &quot; for a tomato that looks ripe, smells<lb/> good and is free of any external disease or insect infestation. Once the tomato is eaten, the consumer<lb/> &quot; experiences &quot; the quality judging it by a variety of subjective factors, such as flavour, firmness and texture.<lb/> However, the consumer is unable to detect any credence attributes of the tomato. These may relate to the<lb/> method of production such as organic or whether it contains toxic elements or residues that may have a<lb/> long term cumulative effect on the health of the consumer. The consumer essentially &quot; trusts &quot; that these<lb/> credence attributes are either present or absent, as the case maybe, in the tomato that was consumed.<lb/> Credence attributes have the potential to be particularly problematic as the consumer has no way of<lb/> identifying their existence through either pre-purchase search (other than at a prohibitive cost) or from post<lb/> consumption experience.<lb/></p>

			<p>Markets for search attributes usually function with simple transactions such as barter exchange or<lb/> open street markets. As full information is available to consumers, these markets can effectively deliver<lb/> search goods with little or no direct government intervention. On the other hand, markets for experience or<lb/> credence goods do not function without some external trust element. For experience attributes,<lb/> information is the most important issue; it determines what consumers can learn about product quality. In<lb/> these markets, producers tend to possess superior information to consumers on the quality of the products<lb/> on offer. In these circumstances, there is a danger of firms taking advantage of their knowledge concerning<lb/> product characteristics and selling low quality products at a price meant for higher quality ones that cost<lb/> more to produce. The risk they face in doing so, however, is a consumer backlash and loss of revenue as<lb/> consumers shop elsewhere in the future for their repeat purchases. Markets for experience goods, therefore,<lb/> have the capacity to self-correct as demand will be responsive over time to changes in product quality,<lb/> particularly with repeated transactions. Markets for experience goods with infrequent purchases often<lb/> require some additional structures to effect the transaction (e.g. brands, warranties and certifications). In<lb/> the long run, the consumer will have near perfect information about product quality.<lb/></p>

			<p>The problem is more difficult in the case of credence goods, which cover many aspects of food<lb/> quality. For these goods, information about product quality attributes cannot be discerned by the consumer,<lb/> before purchase and even after repeated consumption of the food item. Models based on informed<lb/> consumers and seller reputation in markets for experience attributes do not function well for credence<lb/> attributes such as nutritional quality and production methods. Asymmetry in information is also a feature<lb/> of markets for credence food products with users having less information about the inherent quality<lb/> attributes of the product than sellers. Although transactions may be possible in unregulated markets for<lb/> credence goods, the absence of complete consumer knowledge severely limits the potential for an<lb/> economically efficient outcome. Many food products have elements of both experience and credence<lb/> attributes. As a result, agricultural and food products can be viewed as a complex array of quality attributes<lb/> that are packaged together in different combinations and quantities, many of which are not directly<lb/> observable at the time of purchase or even following consumption <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. In order to function<lb/> correctly, these markets require some public regulatory structure or private quality signal to address the<lb/> consumer information uncertainty.<lb/></p>

			<p>Credence type attributes of food quality such as &quot; organic &quot; or &quot; fair trade &quot; are not usually considered to<lb/> be public goods. They are characteristics that some consumers are willing to pay more for, if they can be<lb/> assured of the presence of the desired attribute through &quot; quality signalling &quot; that addresses the uncertainty<lb/> faced by them in making their choice. The solution to market failure resulting from information asymmetry<lb/> is essentially the provision of more information to overcome the adverse selection problem. Quality labels,<lb/> brands, warranties and certifications are designed to provide information to consumers to help reduce<lb/> information uncertainty. According to Caswell <ref type="biblio">[1998]</ref>, labelling can transform credence attributes to search<lb/> attributes that allow the consumer to judge the quality of the food product before purchase. However,<lb/> information will only be effective in reducing information asymmetry and to allow consumers to make<lb/> optimal choices in line with their preferences if it is processed and used by the target audience. Too much<lb/> information or that which is not specifically targeted to consumers needs runs the risk of information<lb/> overload and consumer indifference. <ref type="biblio">[Verbeke, 2005]</ref>. The efficacy of a quality signal is essentially linked<lb/> to two conditions: the pertinence of the information provided and its credibility to the recipient consumer<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Valceschini, 1998]</ref>. For credence type goods, government standards are not the only approach, or<lb/> necessarily the best, to address quality information issues. Such an assessment, however, usually needs to<lb/> be made on a case by case basis. Consumers can rely on producers&apos; voluntary claims or warranties, backed<lb/> up, in some cases, by government laws to prevent deceptive claims. Alternatively, a public standard could<lb/> apply that mandates disclosure of product or production process characteristics to consumers. Consumers<lb/> could also place their trust in a certification provided by an independent third party to provide reliable<lb/> information on the desired food quality attribute <ref type="biblio">[Ippolito, 2003]</ref>. In this case, either a conformity<lb/> certification of an independent third party is used, or else a public standard enforced by government testing<lb/> or inspections to ensure conformity to the standard is applied. While certificates and labels provide a<lb/> means to correct a domestic market failure, these remedies can also have trans-border effects and this issue<lb/> is taken up later in the paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>C.<lb/> Standards: types and definitions<lb/></head>

			<p>Standards are common in all forms of human activity and are designed to both simplify transactions<lb/> and provide an element of certainty in exchange. 5 Standards fulfil a number of diverse functions. In the<lb/> technical realm, standards lower risk, increase credibility and trust, and facilitate predictability for buyers<lb/> and sellers. Standards are necessary, therefore, for the smooth functioning of exchange between<lb/> anonymous economic agents, as parties to a transaction must be assured of the nature and quality of the<lb/> product involved. By reducing search and transaction costs and lowering risk, standards help to facilitate<lb/> exchange and trade. The efficacy of exchange is enhanced by two main functions of a standard – as a<lb/> guarantee of a minimum quality and by defining the characteristics or specifications of the product or its<lb/> production process and associated criteria of performance. Although standardisation is necessary to<lb/> facilitate market operations and implies some degree of homogeneity, it does not follow that variety per se<lb/> is undesirable. Standards reflect the needs of the groups that express them and as long as groups differ,<lb/> their optimal standards will reflect these differences <ref type="biblio">[Casella, 2001]</ref>.<lb/> Following Jones and Hill (1994) <ref type="biblio">Reardon and Farina (2001)</ref>, grades and standards cover a collection<lb/> of technical specifications, definitions, terms and principles of classification and labelling. 6 They include<lb/> rules of weights and measures established by regulation or authority (standards) and a system of<lb/> classification based on quantifiable attributes (grades). Food &quot; product &quot; standards and grades – as opposed<lb/> to &quot; process &quot; standards – specify the characteristics of the final product. These characteristics of the product<lb/> can include shape, size, weight, safety, authenticity, energy, nutritional content and organo-leptic quality<lb/> attributes (colour/appearance, taste, texture, etc.). Commodity standards and grades exist to facilitate the<lb/> operation of agricultural and food marketing systems. However, in an increasingly globalised agricultural<lb/> 5<lb/></p>

			<p>Standards can be defined as a specification or set of specifications that relate to some characteristics of a product or its<lb/> manufacture (<ref type="biblio">Sykes, 1990</ref>).<lb/> and food economy, the role of grades and standards are shifting from the traditional or historical role of<lb/> reducing transaction costs in mass commodity markets towards a role as strategic tools for product<lb/> differentiation and market segmentation<ref type="biblio">[Clayton et al., 2003]</ref>. Product standards, by nature, play a role in<lb/> markets of vertically differentiated products, i.e. products that appear in different varieties and which can<lb/> be ordered according to a certain objective scale (e.g. milk with higher or lower butter fat content). The<lb/> concept of a minimum standard is used in the context of vertically differentiated goods, by implying that<lb/> only products that reach a certain level of quality or higher are considered to meet the standard.<lb/> As opposed to &quot; product &quot; standards, food &quot; process &quot; standards specify the characteristics of the<lb/> production process used to produce the food product, such as organic or biological production, free range,<lb/> use of animal welfare and environmentally friendly production processes, worker/labour conditions, fair<lb/> trade etc. Process standards specify production techniques that the preparation of a food must follow from<lb/> raw product, to processing through to the intermediate and final product for packing and distribution.<lb/> Process standards are introduced for different reasons: because they affect the goods they produce (e.g.<lb/> hygiene standards); because they affect the efficiency of the production process (e.g. network externalities)<lb/> or because they affect the environment (e.g. pollution standards) <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. &quot; Performance &quot; standards<lb/> are the characteristics a product is expected to have when it reaches a certain point in the agri-food chain,<lb/> e.g. the maximum amount of pesticide residue permitted on apples when purchased by processors from<lb/> growers [<ref type="biblio">Reardon and Farina, 2001]</ref>.<lb/> Following <ref type="biblio">Valceschini and Saulais (2005)</ref>, there are four principal criteria by which to compare and<lb/> contrast standards that together make up a system of standardisation. These criteria are illustrated in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> of Box 2. They include the origin of the standard (i.e. who creates the standard), the function or<lb/> content of the standard, how the standard is implemented and the method of control or enforcement to<lb/> ensure conformity. Food quality standards can be classified into private and public standards although the<lb/> line separating them is not always well defined. In many instances, standards adopted by governments and<lb/> based on public law have their origins in private industry. These government policies and regulations in<lb/> conjunction with input, process and performance standards for food products significantly influence how<lb/> private markets for food quality function and develop <ref type="biblio">[Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]</ref>. From the<lb/> perspectives of economic theory, the distinction between public and private standards in a functional<lb/> context depends more on whose interests are being taken into account when the standard is set and<lb/> enforced. For a public standard, based on a public law and set by the government, it is assumed that the<lb/> interests of all actors in the economy -both producers and consumers and society at large (externalities) -<lb/>are taken into consideration. Private standards, on the other hand, are assumed to take account of the<lb/> profits and interests of firms, producers or private bodies. They can be expected to reflect the interests of<lb/> consumers, but only to the extent that such interests correspond to those of the firm and are reflected in the<lb/> price. Standards can also be set by non-government organisations (NGOs), which form another category of<lb/> private standards. NGOs tend to be non-profit oriented and do not necessarily pursue the same objectives<lb/> as governments in standard setting <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a classification of the different types of<lb/> public food quality standards according to four basic dimensions of goals, attribute focus, breadth of<lb/> coverage and scope.<lb/></p>

			<p>Private standards are by definition voluntary, but public standards can be either voluntary or<lb/> mandatory. Voluntary consensus standards arise from a formal coordination process involving participants<lb/> in a market and this may occur with or without the participation of government <ref type="biblio">[Henson and Reardon,<lb/> 2005]</ref>. Voluntary public standards are often combined with certain government labels such as the EU&apos;s<lb/> labels of protected designation of origin (PDO), of protected geographical indication (PGI) and of<lb/> traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG). These are usually non-product related standards, although product<lb/> related production standards also exist (e.g. standards on organic production). Voluntary standards whether<lb/> public or private, and with compliance communicated by labels, provide a mechanism to overcome the<lb/> information asymmetry problem. Countries can choose from several different types of labelling schemes<lb/> that allocate the information provision task to private and public sectors in different ways. These different<lb/> approaches based on voluntary and mandatory regulations are illustrated in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Following <ref type="biblio">[Josling<lb/> et al., 2004]</ref> the first regime provides an example of a labelling procedure for geographical indications for<lb/> food products. Here the industry develops and adopts the standards that make the product eligible for<lb/> designation from a specific region. In the second regime the government plays a large role in the control of<lb/> voluntary claims of such thing as product identity that reduce consumer uncertainty and possibilities of<lb/> quality deception. The third and fourth regimes are based on labelling procedures that require mandatory<lb/> disclosure of information; in one case for labelling a country of origin product and the other for labelling a<lb/> content attribute such as the nutritional composition of a product.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of mandatory (minimum) quality standards, as only food products meeting these standards<lb/> are allowed to be sold in a market, they have the effect of reducing the range of products available for<lb/> consumption, with potential price implications. A broad definition of standards includes mandatory<lb/> technical regulations as well as voluntary agreements on the quality characteristics of goods and services. 7<lb/> Mandatory standards are standards set by public agencies and for which compliance is obligatory. While<lb/> private or proprietary standards are voluntary standards, in many instances they have become de facto<lb/> obligatory because of wide acceptance by market participants due to dominant share in the market or<lb/> practice, or when compliance with them is a requirement for suppliers to access the proprietary value chain<lb/> of some large food retailers and food service firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement in the WTO, on the other hand, makes a clear distinction between<lb/> mandatory technical regulations and voluntary standards. The expression &quot; defacto mandatory standard &quot; is used in the<lb/> sense that the private standard of a food buying firm becomes virtually obligatory for food supplying firms who wish to<lb/> be able to supply or sell food products to the downstream buying firm. This is different from the use of the term in the<lb/> economics of innovation. In this literature, the term &quot; defacto standards &quot; concerns technical standards (formal or<lb/> informal) that have achieved a dominant position in practice, either by enforcement or market dominance This<lb/> contrasts with &quot; de jure standards &quot; required by law and established by regulation or perhaps by means of a voluntary<lb/> standard endorsed by a standards organization such as ISO in response to a widely perceived need.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. A paradigm of standards<lb/></head>

			<p>Box 2 Table1 illustrates the different types of standards. Following Henson <ref type="biblio">[2004]</ref>, standards can be<lb/> considered as a continuum characterized according to the degree to which users have freedom of choice and<lb/> action regarding compliance (Box 2 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). At one end of the continuum are mandatory public regulations<lb/> establishing standards and grades for minimum food quality and at the other end voluntary standards where users<lb/> can decide to comply with or not and take the associated economic consequences that each decision implies.<lb/> Voluntary standards can become de facto mandatory or obligatory on market participants since suppliers are<lb/> obliged to comply with them if they wish to enter or remain within a particular market. Thus, voluntary proprietary<lb/> standards of buyers in the food chain can exclude potential food suppliers from entering into a market if they are<lb/> unable to meet the buyer&apos;s established standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>Source: S. Henson and J. Caswell <ref type="biblio">[1999]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>By applying this distinction between mandatory and voluntary standards, it is possible to define a two-<lb/>dimensional classification of standards (Box 2 <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) that has been widely applied in the literature <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2005]</ref>.<lb/> This classification can be used to compare standardization for products and processes within and across countries.<lb/> For example, in the case of countries at low levels of development, most standards fall into the mandatory public<lb/> quadrant of Box 2 <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. While public standards may exist on the rule books in least developed countries they may<lb/> not have much effect in practice, if not enforced by state authorities due to a lack of resources. As the economy<lb/> develops and becomes more integrated into the global market place, there is typically increased incidence of voluntary<lb/> public standards, particularly for the export sector, and then private standards increase. In the case of developed<lb/> countries, many private proprietary standards have become de facto obligatory for market participants as dominant<lb/> firms impose their requirements on suppliers through the processes of market competition based on quality<lb/> differentiation.<lb/> In most markets voluntary and mandatory standards exist and operate side by side with considerable<lb/> interrelationship and dependencies between them. In the past, most standards introduced by public regulatory<lb/> institutions were mandatory and those applied by private entities were voluntary. However, increasingly public<lb/> agencies have developed voluntary standards (e.g. label rouge in France), whereas it is recognized that the food<lb/> standards of large private food retailers and food service companies with market power can become de facto<lb/> obligatory. Voluntary standards can also evolve as a mechanism to facilitate compliance with mandatory standards or<lb/> to demonstrate such compliance. For example, compliance with voluntary standards (i.e. application of HACCP<lb/> systems) can be used to demonstrate &apos;due diligence&apos; with respect to legal product liability standards. Mandatory<lb/> standards can also reference private standards as part of their requirements. This can reinforce the voluntary use of<lb/> such standards and increase their acceptance. It also helps to ensure that standards institutions seek to consult with<lb/> industries in the standard setting process; when the use of voluntary standards becomes widespread, they may<lb/> become incorporated in mandatory public standards. In this way, voluntary and mandatory standards can be seen as<lb/> complementary and equal components of systems of standardization.<lb/></p>

			<p>A further distinction can be made between national standards and standards developed by countries on a<lb/> collective or multilateral basis. In some circumstances adoption of international standards can be a cost effective way<lb/> to upgrade domestic standards in order to meet international market requirements. The efficacy of this approach to<lb/> standard setting is dependent on the extent to which international standards reflect domestic needs and<lb/> circumstances. Where they do not take adequate account of local conditions, costs of compliance can be greater than<lb/> what is required for domestically based standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>Most types of standards and particularly mandatory regulations will have the effect of increasing<lb/> production and other compliance costs for at least some firms in the food chain. Product standards may<lb/> have lower cost implications than process standards, as the former allow firms more flexibility to choose<lb/> the least costly production methods that meet the standards [<ref type="biblio">Unnevehr and Jensen, 1996; Segerson, 1998]</ref>.<lb/> The implementation of standards will normally also lead to increased costs for consumers in the form of<lb/> higher prices of food products and potentially less variety of choice. While the evolution of (private)<lb/> standards reflects in part changes in consumer demands and preferences, the consumption of food, on the<lb/> other hand, is increasingly being structured by the development of standards. This reflects the proliferation<lb/> and diversification of public and private standards over time. This evolution is being driven by increasing<lb/> regulatory requirements with scientific and technological developments and increasing knowledge as well<lb/> as by rising consumer demand and changing preferences for food diversity and higher quality products.<lb/> The general &quot; ratcheting-up &quot; of quality standards is also contributing to a closer integration between public<lb/> and private standards. The question that arises is whether this is leading to a coherent system of food<lb/> standards as a whole. Furthermore, in view of the growing importance of private voluntary standards in the<lb/> food sector that is predicated, in many instances, on higher food quality, what is the legitimate role for<lb/> public food quality standards in a dynamic food sector?<lb/></p>

			<head>D.<lb/> The rational for government food standards<lb/></head>

			<p>Due to differences in information requirements, the classification of goods as to the information<lb/> available to consumers that was discussed in the previous section pose different issues for public standards<lb/> and regulations. In the case of search type goods, as producers face a risk of loss of business and revenue<lb/> from selling inferior goods they have an incentive to provide the range of quality that consumers are<lb/> willing to pay for. For such food products, consumers have near perfect information about product quality<lb/> before buying the food item. In these cases, consumers are generally capable of protecting themselves or,<lb/> at worst will suffer only temporary damage to their purse, and not their health, if a product does not live up<lb/> to perceived quality expectations. Markets for search goods and attributes would normally, therefore, be<lb/> only a minor focus of government regulatory activities.<lb/> However, in markets for experience goods, which cover many other aspects of food quality, producers<lb/> possess superior information to consumers on the quality of the products on sale. As consumers can only<lb/> identify the quality attributes of experience goods after consumption, public regulation -for instance<lb/> through a requirement for quality information labelling or through the provision of product liability<lb/> legislation -is likely to be more useful than for search good markets. Labelling regulations help to<lb/> alleviate market imperfections based on information deficiencies and have the effect of transforming<lb/> experience attributes into search attributes in goods. As these markets have the potential to self-correct in<lb/> the sense that complete information for quality selection is eventually available, perhaps through repeated<lb/> purchases of the same food item, no informational asymmetries or other reasons for market failure exist in<lb/> the longer run. In this situation, mandatory regulatory intervention on the part of public agencies has been<lb/> shown in the literature to lead to a decrease in social welfare <ref type="biblio">[Bocksteal, 1984]</ref>.<lb/> As informational deficiencies faced by consumers with respect to food quality are even more<lb/> profound in the case of credence type attributes, policy makers often choose to intervene by imposing a<lb/> mandatory standard or label requirement to signal quality in this case. Regulatory oversight of producers&apos;<lb/> quality claims is viewed as a responsibility of the public sector and particularly in the case of the many<lb/> food products that carry no brands where reputational mechanisms (i.e. associating a particular food firm<lb/> with a product) are missing to protect the integrity of market transactions. These regulations can solve the<lb/> information problem, remedy the market failure and increase market efficiency. Direct government<lb/> regulation can take place through enforcement of standards for production processes used to produce food<lb/> or by specifying a level of quality for the final product. Standards thus provide a mechanism through which<lb/> public authorities can regulate the food system in order to ensure social food quality objectives are<lb/> addressed at the level desired. Mandatory standards in this situation act like a minimum standard in<lb/> removing from the market those products not meeting the desired quality standard <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. In this<lb/> way, government standards facilitate the availability of improved information on food quality and have the<lb/> potential to be open and balanced in assessing the various trade-offs involved. These standards can create<lb/> greater accountability for the food industry by discouraging irresponsible activities and rewarding<lb/> beneficial efforts. Furthermore, public regulators can more easily establish a single standard with certainty,<lb/> such as for example an &quot; organic &quot; standard, than private actors and can prosecute any violators under the<lb/> law <ref type="biblio">[McCluskey, 2006]</ref>. However in establishing standards, governments can also be subject to interest<lb/> group pressures and if standards are mandatory they have more potential to act as an exclusionary device.<lb/> Special interests that would be adversely affected by a change can have an incentive to block movement<lb/> and government standard setting procedures in some countries may facilitate such efforts of regulatory<lb/> capture. While it is always difficult to generalise, public standards can display a tendency to be less<lb/> flexible than private protocols in reacting to changing circumstances and do not usually provide incentives<lb/> for innovation. Once in place, government standards can be difficult to change as science and technology<lb/> evolve or as consumer preferences change. In addition, government standards shift the development costs<lb/> to the general taxpayer rather than the potential beneficiary of the standard, possibly leading to more<lb/> lengthy and costly processes. An example of this is the &quot; organic &quot; standard in the US that took some eight<lb/> years to develop <ref type="biblio">[Ippolito, 2003]</ref>. However, this problem of standard &apos;lock-in &quot; on a possibly less than<lb/> optimal path, is also apparent with some industry standards that have been effectively imposed by one or<lb/> two companies. Examples can be found in areas where compatibility standards are critical, and first mover<lb/> advantages exist in achieving market share which may take precedence over product quality (e.g. current<lb/> DVD standard).<lb/> Public standards often take the form of mandatory minimum quality standards (MQS) as discussed in<lb/> Box 1, and have the effect of increasing the provision of some desirable attribute of the food product.<lb/> Traditionally these standards have been enforced through official inspection of production facilities and or<lb/> end products, and at considerable public cost <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. Government food quality standards, backed<lb/> up by the force of law, can have a major influence on the operation of food markets and have been an<lb/> important factor in shaping their development. In most cases, public standards have been beneficial in<lb/> improving food quality. For example, minimum fat and milk solids requirements increase the nutritional<lb/> content of fluid milk. Product quality regulations such as grading standards for fresh fruit also produce<lb/> some desirable consumption characteristics as well as public good aspects. For instance, regulation that<lb/> prohibits or limits pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables will likely reduce the amount of pesticides<lb/> used by farmers and thus contribute to improved environmental quality <ref type="biblio">[Sunding, 2003]</ref>. However, there<lb/> are also a few examples where such regulations have not automatically led to quality improvements. One<lb/> example cited in the literature is USDA&apos;s early beef grading system. These grading standards tended to<lb/> compensate producers for producing larger cattle (i.e. quantity of meat produced) and not for meat quality<lb/> improvements as they inadequately defined beef eating quality characteristics. As a result, beef<lb/> consumption in the United States declined with lower quality meat. Private protocols in the form of private<lb/> brands and quality labels then emerged to address this quality deficiency, with the role of USDA shifting to<lb/> that of an independent auditor of whether these private standards have been met <ref type="biblio">[Ferrier and Lamb, 2007]</ref>.<lb/> The prima facie rationale for public regulatory standards in the food sector has been to both reduce<lb/> the risks to human health from consumption of inferior or below standard quality foods and to protect<lb/> consumers from fraud or deceptive practices of sellers in relation to measurement and voluntary quality<lb/> claims [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Traill, 1993; Antle, 1995]</ref>. The desire to protect consumers and to promote particular<lb/> values (i.e. local foods) and food preparation processes has led to increasing government involvement in<lb/> the control of non health aspects of food quality attributes (e.g. country of origin, organic, protected<lb/> designation of origin or PDOs, protected geographical indication or PGIs, GMOs etc) <ref type="biblio">[Garcia Martinez,<lb/> et al., 2007]</ref>. Grades and standards have a long history in grain markets and were initially promulgated to<lb/> facilitate arms length transactions for largely homogenous goods 8 . They were also used to prevent misuse<lb/> or fraud in relation to weights and measures such as the prevalence of stones and other foreign matter<lb/> being included in flour to increase its weight in transactions between flour millers and buyers <ref type="biblio">[Kindlberger,<lb/> 1983; Hill, 1990]</ref>. In the context of mass markets for largely homogenous commodities, public standards<lb/> have public good characteristics, allow economies of scale in transactions, lower search costs of market<lb/> participants and will likely continue to predominate over private standards <ref type="biblio">[World Bank, 2005]</ref>. However,<lb/> the role of grades and standards is also changing with globalisation of agro-food systems, and a shift from<lb/> commodity oriented mass markets towards markets of highly differentiated products. This is leading to a<lb/> shift in focus of grades and standards from product outcomes (measurable product attributes) towards<lb/> product processes (i.e. how the product is produced, processed, distributed etc) <ref type="biblio">[Clayton et al., 2003]<lb/></ref> Regulators may also assist in correcting market failure due to quality uncertainty through the<lb/> promulgation of definitional standards that help to prevent consumer deception and fraud <ref type="biblio">[Becker, 1999]</ref>.<lb/> This can be useful in relation to process quality and specific characteristics of the production process, such<lb/> as the definition for organic production. This was apparently the case in the United States when USDA set<lb/> a national organic standard which defined what constitutes an organic product. Prior to the promulgation of<lb/> the national standard, some organic foods were certified under state and private certification programmes,<lb/> but consumers were often confused as to what the term actually meant which opened the door to fraud and<lb/> quality misrepresentation. In some European countries, voluntary public standards are frequently combined<lb/> with government labels such as the EU&apos;s labels of PDOs, of PGIs and of traditional speciality guaranteed<lb/> (TSG) which have been established for the benefit of private agricultural producers. These are examples of<lb/> public and private cooperation in quality assurance. The private producers and their representative body set<lb/> the details of the production process covered by the standard. Granting of the public label requires that<lb/> inspection, control and certification be made by an independent third party, usually accredited by the<lb/> public regulator to assure the presence of the relevant credence attributes based on traditional production<lb/> processes and a designated origin <ref type="biblio">[Young and Hobbs, 2002]</ref>.<lb/> For some aspects of product quality, related to human health, it is unclear, however, how acceptable<lb/> informational labelling is to policy makers, food companies and consumers <ref type="biblio">[Caswell and Mojduszka,<lb/> 1996]</ref>. Governments usually prefer to avoid any risk (other than perhaps that of moral hazard) by<lb/> promulgating a mandatory standard in such situations. In recent years, public food standards have tended to<lb/> 8<lb/></p>

			<p>The terms &quot; standard &quot; and &quot; grade &quot; have overlapping uses. The basic distinction is that a grade is a designation that<lb/> places a product in a qualitative category, whereas a standard is a measurable threshold that a commodity has to meet<lb/> in order to qualify as a specified food product (identity standard) or grade of product (grade standard) <ref type="biblio">[Gardner 2003]<lb/></ref> become stricter and more complex, with a greater emphasis on science and a systems approach. At the<lb/> same time, many governments have initiated efforts to apply food quality regulations in ways that are less<lb/> burdensome on food companies. This has led to some shift towards performance based measures that<lb/> afford suppliers greater flexibility to achieve the desired level of food quality in the most cost effective<lb/> manner <ref type="biblio">[Flynn et al., 2003]</ref>. In addition, requirements are progressively being put in place for process<lb/> controls based on the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) for the<lb/> manufacture of food in recognition that end product testing is an expensive and inefficient form of food<lb/> quality control. The form in which food quality regulation is applied has implications for the level and<lb/> form of enforcement used by public authorities to assure food quality. Performance based regulation, when<lb/> paired with HACCP process standards and product traceability, relies mainly on enforcement through<lb/> inspection of firm audits of production records. This replaces the need for regular product inspection and<lb/> firm plant visits under traditional procedures, reducing the costs of enforcement and shifting the role of<lb/> government to one of oversight of the food quality system and its performance.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the context of the shift that is occurring in public policy in a number of countries from regulating<lb/> the product to regulating the process or emphasising performance criteria for achieving food quality (e.g.<lb/> requirements for HACCP), one issue that arises is whether compliance should be achieved with voluntary<lb/> or mandatory standards. The usual assumption in favour of voluntary arrangements is that they have a cost<lb/> advantage for firms in terms of lower compliance and transaction costs when compared with mandatory<lb/> standards. However, a common trend across developed countries is the increasing relevance of government<lb/> regulation based on mandatory HACCP procedures for certain foods and processed products. This<lb/> development raises the question of whether mandatory government intervention necessarily implies higher<lb/> compliance and transaction costs. If they do not, the threat of mandatory regulation may not be sufficient to<lb/> motivate firms to adopt voluntary measures to improve food quality and mandatory approaches may be<lb/> welfare improving <ref type="biblio">[Venturini, 2002]</ref>. This may explain the increasing use of mandatory HACCP-based<lb/> systems in many advanced countries.<lb/> As part of the change in the public role, there has been a trend in some countries towards shifting<lb/> more responsibility for ensuring food quality to the private sector based on private standard protocols and<lb/> certification of system compliance by independent third parties. An example is provided by the procedures<lb/> for quality controls developed in France for importers of fruit and vegetables. Since 1998, importers of<lb/> fruit and vegetables in France have been responsible for undertaking quality controls themselves based on<lb/> a system of auto-control to ensure that minimum residue levels of pesticides and other chemicals present in<lb/> fruit and vegetables satisfy the French standard. The auto-control agreement based on HACCP procedures<lb/> is negotiated between the various sellers and their representative body and approved by the public<lb/> authorities. The representative body of the fruit and vegetable sellers is assigned the responsibility to<lb/> ensure that participating sellers undertake the designated quality controls and respect their commitment.<lb/> The agreement is enforced by the threat of exclusion. The role of the public authorities has been changed<lb/> from carrying out product inspections to checking that fruit and vegetable sellers undertake their auto-<lb/>controls correctly. For this second level control, the authorities rely on reports submitted by sellers on the<lb/> auto-controls carried out. For the public authorities delegation of quality controls to the sellers themselves<lb/> has a number of objectives. These include extending the number and effective coverage of quality controls<lb/> over the market, reducing the cost of public product inspections and releasing these resources for use in<lb/> other sectors where risks may be higher (e.g. meat products) and making public controls more results<lb/> orientated. For the sellers, it allows them to reduce the scope and frequency of public controls and to share<lb/> the cost of auto-control with any required scientific analysis undertaken at a single laboratory at a<lb/> preferential rate which gives them access to economies of scale in implementing the controls. Finally it<lb/> also reduces the extent of their legal responsibility in the event of a quality anomaly being detected, if the<lb/> public authorities consider the sellers have mobilised sufficient resources for the auto-controls procedures.<lb/> If the auto-controls are correctly implemented sellers are not held responsible under criminal law for any<lb/> quality anomaly. In the event that a quality violation is detected, the seller is required to notify their<lb/> representative body who then informs the public authorities of the anomaly <ref type="biblio">[Codron, et al. 2005]</ref>.<lb/> The foregoing provides an example of increased co-ordination and co-operation that is taking place<lb/> between public and private actors in some countries in relation to food standards. The evolution of EU<lb/> food quality legislation provides another example. With the passage of EU food hygiene regulations from<lb/> 1 January 2006, responsibility for the production of safe food lies with food business operators. All food<lb/> businesses are required to have controls that demonstrate they are managing food quality within their<lb/> businesses. This represents a shift from a largely prescriptive control approach towards an enforced self-<lb/>regulatory approach with the regulator imposing a requirement on food businesses to determine and<lb/> implement their own internal rules and procedures to fulfil the regulators policy objectives. The regulator<lb/> is then responsible for approving these internalised rules and for monitoring compliance. While national<lb/> legislation is not required to give effect to the EU legislation beyond providing for their enforcement in<lb/> national jurisdictions, in many cases there are areas that allow member states to adopt additional provisions<lb/> as appropriate in their national law <ref type="biblio">[Garcia Martinez et al. 2007]</ref>. Some shift in focus of regulation is also<lb/> occurring in the US, from a predominately prescriptive process and product standards to more flexible<lb/> performance-based standards that allow food businesses greater choice in the mode of implementation.<lb/> However, for Canada, the predominant approach is still based mainly on detailed process and product<lb/> standards with enforcement through plant level inspection. Although there has occurred a change in focus<lb/> of food quality regulations in the meat and poultry processing sector with a shift of responsibility towards<lb/> food businesses and mandatory application of HACCP procedures. Processing firms have been granted<lb/> some flexibility by the authorities to implement food quality control systems that reflect their own<lb/> particular circumstances <ref type="biblio">[Garcia Martinez et al., 2007]</ref>. The inspection authorities then audit the control<lb/> procedures and records of performance. A question remains, however, whether the move from a<lb/> prescriptive to a self-regulatory approach that is evident in a number of countries is fully acceptable to all<lb/> stakeholders, particularly consumers.<lb/></p>

			<p>There may be other co-regulation opportunities whereby government agencies can rely more on<lb/> private mechanisms of food quality control, including implementation of systems such as the ISO 22000<lb/> series. For example, compliance with such system standards may enable enforcement authorities to<lb/> distinguish between high and low risk food products and establishments and focus their inspection efforts<lb/> accordingly. This, however, requires the confidence of enforcement authorities in the efficacy of private<lb/> standards to assess and maintain compliance with legal public food quality standards. Co-ordination of<lb/> public and private food quality management can potentially result in improvements in the level of food<lb/> quality at lower cost and more effective allocation of regulatory resources. However, the scope for co-<lb/>regulation may depend on the nature of established regulatory and institutional arrangements that differ<lb/> between countries. Recent developments in the EU regulatory environment appear to be providing a wider<lb/> range of opportunities for closer collaboration between regulatory agencies and the private sector through<lb/> the operation of food supply chains, but to date co-regulation remains limited in practice. The formulation<lb/> of coordinated food quality policies that pursue both private and social benefits remains a significant<lb/> challenge to such procedures <ref type="biblio">[Garcia Martinez, 2007]</ref>. Other examples of such public-private coordination<lb/> of a more longstanding nature are the quality labels based on protected geographical indications (PGI),<lb/> protected designation of origin (PDO) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) that have been<lb/> established for the benefit of agricultural producers in France and other parts of Europe and which are now<lb/> enshrined in European Union law. As has been noted, these standards are developed by private producers<lb/> and a representative body, with public authorities ensuring enforcement through certification that the<lb/> standards are met.<lb/> In some cases, the transition to increased private sector responsibility is being reinforced by ex-post<lb/> product liability legislation to provide effective incentives to food producers to sell products of acceptable<lb/> quality in the first instance. In addition to fulfilling more rigorous product and process standards, firms are<lb/> also legally accountable under product liability laws, for damage or harm resulting from a food product<lb/> sold by them. This legal recourse reflects a rise in prominence of both tort liability standards <ref type="biblio">[Buzby et al,<lb/> 2001]</ref> and a duty of care of food sellers with respect to their food quality obligations based on the concept<lb/> of &quot; due diligence &quot; [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Northen, 1998; OECD, 2004; Henson, 2006]</ref>. The introduction of a &quot; due<lb/> diligence &quot; defence under legislation enacted in the UK gave the first major impetus to the development of<lb/> higher private standards for this reason [<ref type="biblio">Hobbs and Kerr, 1992]</ref>.<lb/> Under this defence, food sellers are required to demonstrate that they have been proactive in ensuring<lb/> that the food they handle and any food obtained from upstream suppliers, conforms to legal food standards.<lb/> Food retailers initially responded to this requirement by enhancing their food quality controls, and those<lb/> for their suppliers, which were enforced by a second party audit. This was extended further with the<lb/> introduction of a Rapid Alert System backed up by product traceability within the EU through which<lb/> products in contravention of food quality requirements are made available through a public database<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. The introduction of product liability legislation has encouraged firms to set up standards<lb/> that exceed those required for meeting public standards and passing the government approval process<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Antle, 1995]</ref>. The risk of legal liability of a food supplier can thus work to assure compliance with the<lb/> public food quality regulation. This has been accompanied by a shift of the public role to one of auditing or<lb/> performance oversight based on a system of controls applied by private firms and monitoring their<lb/> performance based on the results achieved <ref type="biblio">[Jaffee and Henson, 2004]</ref>.<lb/> Fundamental differences in national legal systems and institutions for protecting consumers from poor<lb/> quality food products provide some justification for diverging conceptions on the role of government in<lb/> setting and securing compliance with public food standards. Differences in the legal treatment between<lb/> ex ante regulation vis-á-vis ex post litigation, go some way to explaining differences in governmental food<lb/> standards between countries [<ref type="biblio">Buzby and Frenzen, 1999]</ref>. As this approach is not yet widely applied by<lb/> many countries, ex ante regulatory measures through the enforcement of mandatory standards remains the<lb/> dominant approach of public policy to ensure the supply of food that meets established quality<lb/> requirements.<lb/></p>

			<head>E.<lb/> The rise of private standards and protocols<lb/></head>

			<p>Much of the focus of the literature on standards has been on the role of public food quality standards<lb/> both as policy instruments and as potential barriers to trade [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Hooker, 2001]</ref>. While public<lb/> standards have been a feature of national food systems for many years, private standards are a relatively<lb/> recent element of the food quality landscape and their scope and coverage differs widely across countries<lb/> and food products. Private standards have proliferated in a number of industrial countries in recent years,<lb/> operating alongside public regulatory systems and are playing an increasing role in the governance of<lb/> agricultural and food supply chains. To some extent, private food quality standards have emerged in<lb/> response to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and reputational risks, including product<lb/> liability exposure, faced by leading firms operating supply chains, most notably major food retailers and<lb/> food service firms. However they have also been employed to facilitate competitive strategies of product<lb/> differentiation on the basis of an increasingly wide array of food quality characteristics or attributes<lb/> designed to respond to new consumer demands and concerns <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. Private standards are now<lb/> well established in a number of developed countries and are gradually extending their global reach to<lb/> middle income and some low-income countries [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. The latter reflects in part the<lb/> consolidation that has taken place in the food sector resulting in increasing ownership concentration with a<lb/> declining number of large multinational food retail chains, food service operators and food manufacturers.<lb/> These firms have the bargaining power to impose their proprietary standards on different suppliers in<lb/> sourcing their products from wide geographical areas and through competitive strategies centred on their<lb/> own or private brands when operating across national borders. As a consequence, national food quality<lb/> control systems in many developed countries increasingly reflect a mix of public and private standards.<lb/> Despite this growth, private standards are still by no means universal in their coverage with public<lb/> standards continuing to dominate in some countries and for particular food product attributes and<lb/> categories.<lb/> Private food standards continue to evolve in response to a general ratcheting-up of regulatory<lb/> requirements about food quality and in response to changing consumer preferences and demand for higher<lb/> quality and more varied food in general. Private food standards have enabled firms to meet these<lb/> challenges as well as to differentiate their products and to refocus agricultural and food markets from<lb/> price-based to quality-based competition. The role of private standards is supported on the demand side by<lb/> affluent consumers in developed countries with sophisticated and varied tastes and on the supply side by<lb/> production, processing and distribution technologies that allow product differentiation and market<lb/> extension and segmentation. As noted, this shift has led to some changes in the role played by grades and<lb/> standards. In addition to reducing transaction costs of commodity market participants, they are now also<lb/> serving as strategic tools of private firms for market penetration, system coordination, quality and safety<lb/> assurance, brand recognition and product niche definition [Henson and <ref type="biblio">Reardon, 2005]</ref> (see Box 2). By<lb/> enabling firms to capture the benefits of any food quality attributes they supply, private standards provide<lb/> the incentives for these firms to make the required investments to achieve enhanced food quality and the<lb/> means to motivate their suppliers through price premia and other preferential supply terms in governing<lb/> expansive supply chains <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>.<lb/> Consumers for their part are increasingly focused on a broader range of product attributes when<lb/> assessing the quality of food and agricultural products and this has strengthened the role of private agri-<lb/>food quality standards. For instance, at higher levels of income, consumers demand relatively higher levels<lb/> of enhanced attributes associated with food quality, nutrition, health promotion and traceability <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey,<lb/> 2004]</ref>. Food businesses operating in a dynamic agro-food system that is generally characterised by low<lb/> margins and inelastic demand, have responded to these consumer demands with private standards as an<lb/> integral part of their competitive strategies as they seek to communicate their approach to food quality and<lb/> diversity to consumers <ref type="biblio">[Fulponi, 2006]</ref>. Private standards are used to inform consumers about different<lb/> quality attributes and have the effect of increasing consumer loyalty while lowering the price elasticity for<lb/> the food product concerned to reward food suppliers through higher prices for undertaking investment in<lb/> quality management systems <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey, 2004]</ref>.<lb/> In addition to product differentiation and market segmentation, private standards provide firms with<lb/> the means to better co-ordinate or govern production, input supplies and distribution activities that generate<lb/> efficiency gains and cost savings <ref type="biblio">[Holleran, 1999]</ref>. This can lead to lower transaction costs, better<lb/> management of supplies across wide geographical areas that may cut across national borders and to<lb/> standardisation of product requirements over a range of suppliers <ref type="biblio">[Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. Standards<lb/> also permit the production, identification and maintenance of product and process attributes along the<lb/> entire supply chain over time to achieve a consistent supply of food quality attributes supported by own<lb/> brands and certification <ref type="biblio">[Bergès-Sennou et al., 2004]</ref>. This is particularly critical for credence attributes<lb/> that relate to the way food products are produced and handled <ref type="biblio">[Henson and Traill, 1993]</ref>.<lb/> Although private standards are necessarily voluntary in nature, they may be applied by the majority of<lb/> suppliers, reflecting the economic advantage of standardisation or market requirements. In terms of the<lb/> latter, proprietary private standards may become virtually obligatory or &quot; de facto &quot; mandatory in some<lb/> agricultural and food markets as supplying firms have little option but to comply in order to enter or<lb/> remain within a market effectively controlled by a few large buyers with oligopsonistic power [<ref type="biblio">Henson and<lb/> Northen, 1998]</ref>. The end result can be the same as if a public regulation had been imposed. For example,<lb/> &quot; dolphin-safe &quot; tuna fish is a purely voluntary designation, but tins of tuna without the dolphin-safe label<lb/> have now disappeared from retail store shelves in the United States. This private standard has been widely<lb/> applied in practice and has now become the de facto industry standard. Proprietary private standards are<lb/> especially prominent among large food retailers, food manufacturers and food service operators, reflecting<lb/> their considerable market power and competitive strategies based around private brands that tie the firm&apos;s<lb/> reputation and performance to the quality of the products it supplies <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. Drives to enhance<lb/> minimum quality standards, differentiate products and at the same time to manage transaction costs and the<lb/> risks of large supply chains, has provided considerable impetus for the evolution of private food quality<lb/> standards, most notably in Europe. These factors suggest that private food quality standards tend to be<lb/> more pro-active and agile and thus likely subject to more rapid change than public modes of food<lb/> regulation as firms seek to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences. Overall, private voluntary<lb/> standards predicated on achieving higher quality food products, and which offer increased flexibility and<lb/> responsiveness to cater to changing consumer demands for variety over a range of quality dimensions, are<lb/> rapidly becoming a major driver in agri-food markets and a global phenomenon[<ref type="biblio">Henson and Reardon,<lb/> 2005]</ref>.<lb/> However, it needs to be acknowledged that private standards as a fairly recent addition to national<lb/> food systems have not emerged in isolation. The development of private protocols and brands has been<lb/> facilitated by the fact that they have, in many instances, been built on the foundation provided by the<lb/> existing public standards infrastructure. The public minimum quality standards provided the initial basis<lb/> for launching a quality differentiation of the private product at a more reasonable cost, while at the same<lb/> time reducing opportunities for fraud and abuse. Thus, the evolution and specific forms taken by private<lb/> standards reflect, at least in part, prevailing national public standards. In other cases, private standards<lb/> simply adopted aspects of public standards such as minimum food safety and hygiene requirements and<lb/> these became a common and non-competitive element of private standards. Private standards have also<lb/> evolved in response to changes in the level and nature of pubic regulatory requirements. As public<lb/> regulations and standards have changed, become increasingly stringent and applied more widely, this has<lb/> encouraged higher private food standards as well to allow a food company to continue to differentiate its<lb/> products from the more generic unbranded foods that meet the higher public minimum quality standard<lb/> (MQS). As a result, any change in the public MQS requirement leads to a modification of private strategies<lb/> of quality differentiation <ref type="biblio">[Codron et al., 2005]</ref>. In other cases, inadequate public food standards have been<lb/> a motivating factor. Firms will also have an incentive to implement private standards when public food<lb/> quality standards are missing or judged inadequate (or otherwise unenforced). In this situation, private<lb/> standards can act as a substitute for missing or ineffective public regulations <ref type="biblio">[Reardon et al. 2001; Henson<lb/> and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. This has reportedly been the situation in some least developed countries where private<lb/> standards developed by some multinational food retailers for their home markets have been also applied in<lb/> less developed countries to the advantage of local consumers [<ref type="biblio">Reardon and Berdegeue, 2002]</ref>. Private<lb/> standards may even develop when public regulations already provide a high level of food quality. This may<lb/> occur because private standards can be implemented as a means to limit a firms&apos; exposure to ex post<lb/> product liability, to mitigate risk of reputational damage, if the firm has been found to sell food that does<lb/> not meet the public minimum quality standards, or to pre-empt additional regulatory measures <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al.,<lb/> 2000]</ref>.<lb/> In reflection of these various developments and pressures, private standards, which are increasingly<lb/> buyer-driven in nature and global in reach, are seen as important drivers of change in agri-food systems of<lb/> developed and increasingly developing countries [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Hooker, 2001]</ref>. The promulgation of private<lb/> food quality standards has been supported by the development of quality meta-systems such as Hazard<lb/> Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) procedures, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good<lb/> Agricultural Practice (GAP) and so forth <ref type="biblio">[Caswell et al., 1998]</ref>. Some observers have viewed such meta-<lb/>systems as &quot; codes of conduct &quot; for participation in the agri-food system and achieving a particular food<lb/> quality attribute [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. Increasingly such systems are seen as governing the<lb/> operation of the entire supply chain from farm production and processing to distribution and final retail<lb/> sale of the food product [<ref type="biblio">Dolan and Humphrey, 2001; Fulponi, 2006]</ref>. Some of these quality meta-systems<lb/> are embedded in voluntary public standards at the national or international level (e.g. ISO 22000), while<lb/> others are proprietary private standards developed by standards bodies (e.g. SQF 2000) or by individual<lb/> food companies (e.g. Tesco&apos;s Nature&apos;s Choice) <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. Some of the meta-systems that started out<lb/> as voluntary codes of good practice have now been incorporated into public regulations, representing a<lb/> further blurring of the line of demarcation between public and private standards. An example is the<lb/> inclusion of HACCP as part of the regulatory requirements for meat and meat products in the United<lb/> States, Canada and the EU. Thus, while private standards may develop as a means to comply with public<lb/> regulatory requirements, there are also instances of government regulations adopting the mechanisms<lb/> employed by private standards and referencing private standards in their rules. This trend reflects the<lb/> significant institutional changes being made in the public sphere in relation to the general oversight of food<lb/> supply chains and food quality, in particular, in a number of countries.<lb/> Public and private food standards are also matched by public and private modes of enforcement of<lb/> such standards. As private firms are not always able to fully capture the returns from incorporating costly<lb/> controls of product hazards or production methods, they may lack the incentive to implement methods to<lb/> assure products that meet the higher quality standard of differentiated products and to provide the degree of<lb/> control to contain quality problems that may pose health hazards in the food product [<ref type="biblio">Jensen and Hayes,<lb/> 2006]</ref>. Faced with this situation, private quality assurance systems have developed on the basis of private<lb/> certification (both self, second and independent third party), improved transparency 9 and traceability. Self<lb/> regulation covers the establishment of internal control systems for product quality, while certification<lb/> involves the monitoring and certification of measurable product and process quality standards by a private<lb/> second party or independent third party organisation. Such certification may also be voluntary or stipulated<lb/> by those with whom the firm does business <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref> and vary by products. From the literature, public<lb/> certification for food quality is high in the case of meat products in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New<lb/> Zealand and Japan. However, private certification was strongest in European Countries and weakest in the<lb/> US and Japan <ref type="biblio">[Jensen and Hayes, 2006]</ref>. Regardless of the nature of the standard, third party auditors of<lb/> standards are usually approved on an individual basis by the official accreditation agency in the country in<lb/> which they operate. This represents another example where private standard regimes are reliant on public<lb/> systems of oversight to ensure their credibility <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>.<lb/> The success of private voluntary standards in the food sector has lead to changes in standard setting<lb/> processes, including the emergence of coalitions or consortia of firms for setting private standards. One<lb/> result of adopting higher private standards for product differentiation and competitive positioning in<lb/> markets or to guard against product tort liability has been an increase in transaction costs for individual<lb/> firms that established their own standards. As a result, pressures emerged from such firms for the<lb/> developments of collective and harmonised private standards through industry organisations and groups of<lb/> firms [e.g. British Retail Consortium (BRC), International Food Standards (IFS)], with the collective<lb/> standards certified by a third party audit (e.g. European Food Safety Inspection Service) and by private<lb/> firms as a substitute for business–to-business standards [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Northen, 1998]</ref>. This had the<lb/> advantage of reducing the costs of governing the supply chain for individual firms and widening the group<lb/> of potential suppliers from which they could procure. As a result, standards of global business to business<lb/> (B2B) arrangements were extended in the form of procurement standards designed to improve overall<lb/> value chain performance and their governance <ref type="biblio">[Casella 1997, 2001; Nadvi and Waltring, 2003; Fulponi,<lb/> 2006]</ref>. Co-ordinated or harmonised standards can thus secure competitive advantage for member firms and<lb/> allow them to pursue common objectives in a non-competitive manner [<ref type="biblio">Dolan and Humphrey, 1999;<lb/> Casella, 2001]</ref>. While food supplying and distributor companies are interested in a rationalisation of<lb/> private proprietary standards as proliferation is expensive for them in terms of additional transaction costs,<lb/> they also fear a single standard, managed by some downstream retailer or food service company, over<lb/> which they have no control. They are thus faced with the challenge of balancing the cost advantages of a<lb/> single standard against the loss of freedom of action.<lb/></p>

			<p>The focus of harmonisation efforts amongst leading firms to act collectively has also extended from<lb/> national/regional institutions (such as BRC and Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREP)) towards<lb/> international private standard organisations such as the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). These private<lb/> quality standards continue to evolve overtime from business to business, collective standards and Business<lb/> To Consumer (B2C) standards. In many cases, B2B standards that are used to support and protect wider<lb/> efforts of product differentiation are not directly communicated to consumers. However, other B2C<lb/> standards have been developed by major retailers (such as the Filière Agriculture Raisonnée by Auchan,<lb/> the Filière Qualité by Carrefour and the Finest brand by Tesco Stores PLC) and also by producer<lb/> organisations that are linked to brands or symbols where quality is communicated directly to consumers.<lb/> They are also evolving from national to regional and international standards and from first to second and<lb/> third party methods of certification and conformity testing.<lb/> As a result, agri-food systems of many countries are now pervaded by an array of interrelated public<lb/> and private standards. This proliferation of standards is leading to increasingly complex relationships<lb/> between them. Notwithstanding, a trend appears to be underway of a shift from mandatory standards as the<lb/> predominant form of control or governance over food quality that are positioned in the public sector to an<lb/> increasing role of the private sector and more voluntary forms of control. This is reflected in the growing<lb/> number and role of standards originating from private firms and groups including proprietary standards as<lb/> de facto mandatory ones in food markets <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. It would appear that private standards are<lb/> assuming increasing responsibility for many aspects of food quality as the role of government shifts further<lb/> to oversight of the entire food quality system and monitoring firms&apos; quality performance through audits of<lb/> control systems and similar procedures [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Hooker, 2001; Henson, 2006]</ref>. This is leading in<lb/> some instances to increased coordination and cooperation between public and private actors in standards<lb/> procedures, as the example of the French system of quality standards applied to importers of fruit and<lb/> vegetables has suggested <ref type="biblio">[Codron et al. 2005]</ref>. A case may exist for exploring further co-regulatory<lb/> approaches or public/private partnerships <ref type="biblio">[Garcia Martinez et al., 2005]</ref> to achieve food quality objectives<lb/> in a more efficient way.<lb/></p>

			<head>F<lb/> Standards and trade<lb/></head>

			<p>A further dimension to the interaction between public and private standards arises when the interests<lb/> of other countries have to be taken into account through international exchange. Governments have a<lb/> primary role in establishing trade policy and granting access to their national markets. Because standards<lb/> reflect, amongst other things, levels of industrialisation and economic development, as well as national<lb/> cultures and values, they are likely to differ between countries. The resulting heterogeneity in public<lb/> standards and regulations is likely to affect international trade. Standards play a role in international<lb/> competitiveness and their potential to act as non-tariff barriers is now widely recognised. Also, with the<lb/> development of multinational food businesses with global procurement practices, private standards now<lb/> extend across national borders and can also affect trade. The following sections examine a number of<lb/> issues that arise for international food trade as a result of heterogeneous national standards and global<lb/> private standards. Among the questions addressed are: do heterogeneous national standards and regulations<lb/> impair trade and how can these impacts be minimised? Are there additional constraints on public standards<lb/> setting practices arising from the WTO system and how do they relate to private standards of global firms?<lb/> How do international standards organisations such as the Codex Alimentarius and the International<lb/> Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) fit into the public-private standards architecture?<lb/></p>

			<head>F.i<lb/> Public standards and trade<lb/></head>

			<p>The complexity of the interaction of public and private quality standards is considerably increased in<lb/> the context of international trade. In addition, the distinction between product and process standards has<lb/> become important in the context of the multilateral trading system, particularly process standards that<lb/> involve unincorporated processes and production methods (PPMs) 10 <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. The main risk of<lb/> national public standards from a trade perspective is that they are backed by the power of the state and that<lb/> in the course of developing standards, governments can favour domestic producers over imports by<lb/> stipulating idiosyncratic production and processing methods <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. These may act as non-tariff<lb/> trade barriers and restrict trade. The welfare effects of standards can also change when the international<lb/> trade dimension is considered. As noted in the context of national standard setting, mandatory standards<lb/> when implemented in markets for credence goods can increase efficiency and national welfare by<lb/> removing information asymmetries between buyers and sellers of food products. National welfare in the<lb/> standard imposing country will increase in such circumstances if a standard is well designed. However,<lb/> global efficiency and welfare may not necessarily be improved as a consequence of the trade effects of the<lb/> national standard <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>.<lb/> National standards that aim at increasing efficiency can, therefore, have complex effects when the<lb/> trade dimension is taken into account <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004]</ref>. In the first case, firms facing food quality standards<lb/> in their own markets that differ from those in foreign markets may be placed at a competitive disadvantage<lb/> in selling into foreign markets relative to national firms. This may also apply to quasi-public production<lb/> standards at the farm level. For example, many of the farm-level quality assurance schemes are designed<lb/> and implemented by national producer organisations and it is to their advantage to use the system to<lb/> differentiate national production in a positive way from competing imports <ref type="biblio">[Holleran et al., 1999]</ref>. By the<lb/> same token, standards can also work against the interests of exporters in standard setting countries. If a<lb/> country introducing a standard is an exporting country, trade is unlikely to increase. To the extent that<lb/> production costs are larger for higher quality foods, domestic exporters, unless they are able to differentiate<lb/> their products and secure a return for higher quality, will then become less competitive in world markets<lb/> where their foreign competitors are not required to meet the same quality standards <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>.<lb/> International trade agreements are another influence changing the contours of public and private<lb/> control systems [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Caswell, 1999]</ref>. It is in the area of government mandated product and process<lb/> standards where the greatest concern exists about possible adverse effects on trade <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. As tariffs<lb/> and other traditional tools for managing imports and controlling market access are reduced under<lb/> progressive trade agreements, there remains the temptation to use sanitary and phyto-sanitary as well as<lb/> technical quality food regulations as non-tariff barriers to fill the void to protect domestic producers. As a<lb/> result, national food regulatory control systems are coming under increasing scrutiny as potential non-tariff<lb/> barriers to trade, and governments are collectively pursuing efforts towards multilateral coordination of<lb/> regulatory activities <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004]</ref>. In the international sphere, attempts have been made to overcome the<lb/> potential negative trade effects of food quality standards. The World Trade Organization (WTO) through<lb/> the Agreements on Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) measures and on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)<lb/> has played an important role in this respect. These agreements represent the most comprehensive attempt<lb/> to address the impact of food standards on trade and have lead to the implementation of certain types of<lb/> national standards becoming more transparent. As a result of these agreements, countries now have a<lb/> formal responsibility and some incentives to attend to the trade impacts of their regulatory programmes<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Caswell and Henson, 1999]</ref>. WTO members that develop new standards or technical regulations that are<lb/> 10<lb/></p>

			<p>Although processes are typically not traded, the goods they produce may be traded and therefore processes are<lb/> important for trade. The relevance of unincorporated PPMs for trade policy is less straightforward as they do not<lb/> directly affect anything that is traded. However, consumers or governments in an importing country may care about the<lb/> way an imported good is produced because, for example, they care about the environmental impact of the production<lb/> process (e.g. the case of US shrimps). Labour standards share many characteristics with process standards.<lb/> not based on international standards are required to notify the measures prior to implementation under the<lb/> terms of the SPS and TBT Agreements. The growth in these notifications also provides evidence of the<lb/> increased number and incidence of public standards.<lb/> International rules for the regulation of agricultural product and food attributes are primarily dealt<lb/> with in the SPS and TBT Agreements that were concluded in 1994. The SPS Agreement has established<lb/> specific disciplines for the regulation of food safety attributes; the GATT/WTO and the TBT Agreement<lb/> has revised rules for the regulation of other food quality attributes. The TBT Agreement covers technical<lb/> regulations, standards, including packaging, marking and labelling and conformity assessment procedures.<lb/> In the agro-food sector, the TBT Agreement applies to all rules other than those relating to animal, plant<lb/> and human life and health which are the focus of the SPS Agreement. Food quality issues such as nutrition<lb/> labelling are covered by the TBT Agreement. Another trade accord, the Agreement on Trade Related<lb/> Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) includes provisions protecting the use of geographical<lb/> indications that are used to differentiate agricultural and food products in the market place. After 1994, the<lb/> World Trade Organization became the court of last resort when member countries dispute trade barriers<lb/> related to SPS and TBT matters 11 <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey, 2004]</ref>.<lb/> The SPS agreement defines guiding principles that aim to minimise the trade distorting effects of food<lb/> standards that apply to health and outlines procedures for the resolution of disagreements between<lb/> countries over these standards. There are two approaches through which national food standards can be<lb/> justified within the Agreement. Firstly, through the adoption of international standards which are<lb/> automatically assumed to be consistent with the provisions of the Agreement(s); and secondly, through an<lb/> assessment of the risks to human (as well as plant and animal) health addressed by the food regulation. In<lb/> addition, the agreement establishes a number of criteria which national regulations must satisfy, either<lb/> where no international standard exists, or where a state wishes to deviate from or go beyond an<lb/> international standard. Risk assessment is a key element of the disciplines laid down by the SPS<lb/> Agreement to assess different standards. The SPS agreement has important implications for food regulation<lb/> at the national level. Essentially it constrains the activities of regulatory agencies, requiring them to adopt<lb/> only food quality controls that can be scientifically justified and which have the least impact on trade 12 .<lb/> The WTO agreements impose wide-ranging procedural requirements such as notification and consultation<lb/> obligations and transparency obligations. The latter goes beyond allowing sufficient time for other<lb/> governments to comment on regulations and for consultation to take place, and require the establishment of<lb/> enquiry points to answer questions and receive comments from persons in other states. The TBT also lays<lb/> down criteria for conformity assessment procedures (as does the SPS Agreement on control and inspection<lb/> procedures) to ensure that the requirements of the standard are fulfilled. However, it is evident from<lb/> disputes lodged with the WTO that governments face domestic pressures for regulations that do not satisfy<lb/> all these requirements <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey, 2004]</ref>.<lb/> An initial assessment of disputes examined by the WTO Appellate body under these different<lb/> agreements suggests that the SPS Agreement has been more successful in resolving differences over<lb/> animal and plant regulations than in resolving disputes over food safety related measures, particularly in<lb/> 11<lb/></p>

			<p>The TBT Agreement has a wider coverage than the SPS Agreement in the domain of food quality standards. The SPS<lb/> Agreement covers all measure whose purpose is to protect human and animal health from food borne risks, to protect<lb/> human health from animal and plant carried diseases; to protect animals and plants from pests or disease or to prevent<lb/> or limit damage to a country from the entry, establishment or spread of pests. The TBT Agreement covers all technical<lb/> regulations, voluntary standards and conformity assessment procedures to ensure that these are met. In general, it is the<lb/> type of measure that determines coverage of the TBT Agreement, but the purpose of the measure which is relevant in<lb/> determining whether it is subject to the SPS Agreement <ref type="biblio">[WTO, p 145]</ref>.<lb/> relation to the risk management principles <ref type="biblio">[IATRC, 2001]</ref>. The impact of the TBT Agreement on the<lb/> regulation of other quality attributes of agricultural products is more difficult to ascertain in the absence of<lb/> a similar body of dispute panel reports that have been decided on the basis of the agreement. The use of<lb/> panels to settle disputes under the TBT Agreement appears to remain the exception rather than the rule.<lb/> The IATRC study noted that despite some uncertainties about the rules to be applied for these other food<lb/> attributes, there is nonetheless substantial evidence of increased interest on the part of countries in quality<lb/> standards and labelling to achieve a wide array of objectives. Furthermore, it notes that most of the<lb/> regulatory effort in this sphere of activity is being directed at consumer concerns on the basis of increasing<lb/> acceptance of the principle of their right to know and to improve transparency. As labelling is expected to<lb/> be more widely used for a greater range of purposes in coming years, the TBT Agreement is considered to<lb/> likely play a larger role in setting the rules for international trade in food products <ref type="biblio">[IATRC, 2001]</ref>. These<lb/> developments, together with increasing international surveillance of national measures, would suggest that<lb/> direct regulatory standards can be expected to become increasingly global in terms of the criteria that are<lb/> applied and the mechanisms used to ensure that standards are met [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Caswell, 1999]</ref>.<lb/> In an attempt to reduce the trade distorting effects of diverse national food quality standards,<lb/> governments are also seeking to co-operate in their regulatory efforts. This has been termed &quot; regulatory<lb/> rapprochement &quot; [<ref type="biblio">Caswell and Hooker, 1996; Hooker and Caswell, 1999]</ref>. It is possible to identify three<lb/> levels of regulatory rapprochement that vary with the level of co-operation, namely co-ordination,<lb/> equivalence or mutual recognition, and harmonisation. Co-ordination refers to attempts to minimise<lb/> differences in food quality regulations between countries, for example, through adoption of voluntary<lb/> international codes of practice. The equivalence or mutual recognition principle involves the acceptance of<lb/> different forms of food quality standards amongst countries as being equivalent. Finally, harmonisation of<lb/> standards involves the standardisation of food quality regulations between countries, for example through<lb/> the adoption of international standards. A common international standard has the potential to facilitate<lb/> trade across borders by making products more substitutable, increasing consumer confidence in product<lb/> characteristics, ensuring compatibility between products and so forth [<ref type="biblio">Henson and Caswell, 1999]</ref>. To the<lb/> extent that different national standards have segmented domestic from foreign markets, harmonisation is<lb/> expected to lead to increased trade and competition, lower prices and enhanced quality <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>.<lb/> The different principles of regulatory rapprochement, however, are not always exactly coinciding. In<lb/> some cases harmonisation, rather than equivalence, is the guiding principle. In others the reverse may be<lb/> true. Hooker and Caswell <ref type="biblio">[1995]</ref> in their earlier review suggest that the type of product or attribute should<lb/> be an important factor in determining the guiding principle used under the WTO and that one should<lb/> expect harmonisation for food safety standards and mutual recognition for food quality standards. The case<lb/> in favour of harmonisation of standards, however, is relatively weak when it comes to standards addressing<lb/> information asymmetries. To the extent that countries differ it may be preferable to have different policies<lb/> rather than one single policy <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. While some progress has been made under these WTO<lb/> agreements in addressing the trade effects of food quality attributes, countries have resisted substantial<lb/> recognition of equivalence between national regulatory regimes as a basis for ensuring national treatment,<lb/> and harmonisation of standards has not been overly effective to date in defining uniform standards<lb/> multilaterally <ref type="biblio">[IATRC, 2001; Henson, 2004]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>F.ii<lb/> Private standards and trade<lb/></head>

			<p>Voluntary private standards in addition to public regulations are also increasingly recognised as<lb/> having a potential trade impact. As private quality standards often go well beyond basic regulatory<lb/> requirements, they can impose significant costs of compliance on food suppliers and exporters. Such costs<lb/> can arise from fixed investments in adjusting production and processing facilities, personnel and<lb/> management costs to implement the standard and associated control systems and the costs of conformity<lb/> assessment. These costs are likely to be greater for exporters in countries where public and private<lb/> standards are less well developed <ref type="biblio">[Jaffee and Henson, 2004]</ref>. As voluntary standards can differ across<lb/> countries they can raise an effective barrier to trade or participation in exchange to those firms, groups or<lb/> farmers which are unable to meet the supply standard <ref type="biblio">[Fulponi, 2006]</ref>. Another concern with the growth of<lb/> private standards in a trade context is their impact on the transparency of regulatory processes. Although<lb/> the WTO commits member states to notify all new public food quality standards and to provide<lb/> opportunities for trade partners to raise their concerns and engage in dialogue, this does not apply to<lb/> private standards <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004]</ref>. However, in the promulgation of collective private standards, many<lb/> stakeholders along the supply chain are normally involved, including from different countries. This might<lb/> suggest that such standards are also open to influence by a wide range of stakeholders including trading<lb/> partners [Jaffee and <ref type="biblio">Henson, 2005]</ref>. Nevertheless, the growth in private collective standards by global food<lb/> businesses does raise the issue of the implications for the WTO and SPS and TBT Agreements and whether<lb/> these standards fall within the ambit of the rights and obligation specified in these agreements [Jaffee and<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Henson, 2005]</ref>. For example, the SPS Committee of the WTO focuses its work on standards developed by<lb/> members which represent participating governments, whereas private standards are essentially developed<lb/> by commercial entities and this limits the Committee&apos;s ability to address many of these requirements. 13<lb/> Much of the debate on the impact of more stringent private standards on trade has focussed on<lb/> developing countries and the risks they face in exclusion from buyer-driven supply chains in gaining<lb/> access to developed countries&apos; markets <ref type="biblio">[Jaffee and Henson, 2004; World Bank, 2005; Fulponi, 2006]</ref>.<lb/> These standards are perceived as barriers either because the developing countries lack the technical and<lb/> administrative capacities and resources for compliance or because the standards can be applied in a<lb/> discriminatory or protectionist way. To date, analysis of the trade impacts of food quality standards has<lb/> focussed largely on public measures and predominately regulatory approaches. While empirical research<lb/> has demonstrated that public food quality standards can act as significant barriers to trade in agricultural<lb/> and food products, this would suggest that private standards might have similar effects, although there is<lb/> no comparable body of empirical literature. To the contrary, the trend towards collective private standards<lb/> and their harmonisation across global markets, suggests that these might act to facilitate trade. In weighing<lb/> up the competing trade reduction and creation effects of private standards, however, it needs to be<lb/> acknowledged that in many agricultural and food product markets, such as bulk grains and fruits and<lb/> vegetables and so on, public standards remain the dominant form of governance. In these cases, B2B and<lb/> collective private standards are unlikely to be a major impediment to this trade <ref type="biblio">[Jaffee and Henson, 2004]</ref>.<lb/> Furthermore, as noted previously, there are many countries in the world where private standards are less<lb/> evolved, such as Japan, and public standards remain the dominant influence on trade.<lb/> An alternative perspective to the traditional standards as barriers argument is that of standards as<lb/> catalysts to increase trade. Emerging standards offer the possibility that certain developing countries could<lb/> use these opportunities to improve their competitive advantage. From this viewpoint, the emerging<lb/> standards represent a potential bridge between increasingly demanding consumer requirements and the<lb/> participation of developing country suppliers in buyer-driven supply chains. Investing in new procedures to<lb/> comply with higher food standards of such buyers may provide a powerful incentive for the modernisation<lb/> of developing countries&apos; export supply chains and enable them to reposition themselves in competitive<lb/> global markets. Compliance with standards in one supply chain may provide access to multiple chains, in<lb/> particular, where collective standards are in place. Hence the process of standards compliance could<lb/> conceivably provide the basis for more sustainable and profitable trade over the longer term. The foregoing<lb/> discussion suggests a more complex reality in which close attention is needed to the specifics of particular<lb/> markets, products and countries to understand how the changing international standards environment is<lb/> providing both challenges and opportunities for developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>13<lb/></head>

			<p>The TBT Agreement, on the other hand, establishes the possibility of the preparation, adoption and<lb/> application of technical regulations by Non-Governmental bodies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Barriers to trade arising from private standards can also be removed through harmonisation or mutual<lb/> recognition. International harmonisation of voluntary standards can take place through inter-governmental<lb/> treaties but is more likely through standard sharing coalitions of firms and industry consortia. These are<lb/> usually designed to avoid or minimise wasteful duplication of compliance costs that result from multiple<lb/> national standards and to exploit economies of scale at a more disaggregated level of economic activity<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Casella, 2001]</ref>. Pressures to harmonise and rationalise voluntary food standards across countries and<lb/> systems of conformity assessment, can be expected to become more important as food companies continue<lb/> to expand across the world and develop global supply chains <ref type="biblio">[Casella, 2001]</ref>. At the same time, it is<lb/> important to recognise that public standards still matter in the context of business to business arrangements<lb/> and global food chains. In addition to satisfying private voluntary standards, exporters to a country need to<lb/> comply with public regulatory requirements before gaining access to that country&apos;s market.<lb/></p>

			<head>F.iii<lb/> Standards and the multilateral trading system<lb/></head>

			<p>One intention of the Uruguay Round Agreement was to bring national food policies regulations into<lb/> closer harmonisation by adopting and strengthening the language of the Codex Alimentarius. Although the<lb/> Codex Alimentarius Commission sets the benchmark international standards for food quality and safety<lb/> that form the guidelines used by the WTO in assessing trade restrictions, individual countries continue to<lb/> regulate the quality of the food available to their consumers. In such circumstances, Codex is seen as a first<lb/> step to harmonisation of world food standards <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey, 2004]</ref>. In addition to the Codex, the United Nations<lb/> Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) standards are internationally recognised benchmarks, are<lb/> more oriented towards quality issues and are commonly used as the basis for many national grades and<lb/> standards. OECD standards for seeds, forestry reproduction material and fruit and vegetables are also an<lb/> important component of this intergovernmental standards network.<lb/> A number of difficulties have been identified in the literature for the Codex Commission in<lb/> discharging this function. For example, the goals established in the SPS Agreement of basing food<lb/> regulations on scientific evidence (as opposed to social need), while allowing countries to set standards<lb/> higher than those called for by international regulations in recognition of cultural, dietary and other<lb/> national differences, might suggest that they could be subverted by national interests [<ref type="biblio">Gaull and Goldberg,<lb/> 1993]</ref>. A second potential problem that has been identified in the literature is that scientific expertise and<lb/> resources vary greatly among Codex member nations. This tends to give an advantage to developed<lb/> countries over developing nations in setting standards. Codex deliberations in reaching a consensus on a<lb/> multinational food standard amongst its membership can at times be a long and drawn out affair <ref type="biblio">[Kinsey,<lb/> 2004]</ref>. 14 Despite these experiences, Codex has helped raise food quality standards around the world making<lb/> it essential to human health and food trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>The standards development process organised by national, supra-national/regional and international<lb/> standards institutions has evolved over time. The national standardisation infrastructure in most<lb/> industrialised countries is now integrated into the network of international standardisation activities.<lb/> However not all low income or transition economies have followed this trend as their national institutions<lb/> are not part of the international network <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. Of the 49 international standardising bodies<lb/> identified by a recent WTO study <ref type="biblio">[2005]</ref>, the International Organisation of Standardization (ISO), is the<lb/> most important non-government body with respect to food quality issues. Standards set by the ISO are<lb/> voluntary, but some are referred to in technical regulations particularly in regard to health and safety as<lb/> part of national regulatory frameworks and, thus, have become de facto mandatory in application. ISO<lb/> standards such as ISO 9000 on quality management systems tend to have more focus on the specific<lb/> 14<lb/> Kinsey, in her analysis of Codex procedures for setting standards, cites the example of the protracted deliberations and<lb/> processes undertaken by the Commission since 1974 to elaborate a standard on &apos;parmesan &quot; cheese. In other cases such<lb/> as for &quot; yoghurt &quot; , Codex standards have been set with relative ease.<lb/> concerns of industry with greater participation of the private sector. ISO standards continue to evolve, with<lb/> ISO 22000 establishing for the first time a global standard for food quality management systems that<lb/> encompasses the entire supply chain from production through to distribution that is well beyond the scope<lb/> of most private standards. How this new standard will impact on the future evolution of private standards<lb/> is yet to be seen. Certification of ISO standards is also increasingly becoming a requirement of many<lb/> national systems of public process standards. These must also comply with international norms and the<lb/> testing and certification procedures in such cases need to be recognised internationally.<lb/> Many developing countries are increasingly being integrated into the international standardisation<lb/> system. However, a considerable number of low income countries are still not actively participating in this<lb/> process, although they continue to be affected by it <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. The implementation of food standards<lb/> and regulations involve costs and potentially important costs for developing countries when commitments<lb/> are bound in negotiated trade agreements. Some of these costs arise from the normal requirements for<lb/> testing and certification (conformity assessment) procedures necessary to determine if a food product<lb/> meets standardised requirements justified by scientific risk. However, cost duplication can also arise for<lb/> developing countries in determining conformity to varying national technical regulations for gaining<lb/> market access for example to the different Member State markets in the European Union.<lb/></p>

			<p>Standards institutions in poorer countries are generally located in the public sector with limited<lb/> participation of the private sector. 15 While food quality standards may exist on the rule book and be well<lb/> documented in such countries, a particular problem arises with respect to the enforcement of existing<lb/> standards due to limited public, financial and technical resources for these activities. Where there is<lb/> insufficient capacity to implement and enforce even basic food standards, private voluntary standards and<lb/> associated management and verification processes of food businesses can provide a useful parallel<lb/> mechanism to raise standards to provide protection for consumers <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004]</ref>. While this leads to an<lb/> improvement in food quality and a degree of uniformity across countries in which particular multinational<lb/> firms operate, there is a risk that such standards may not fully reflect the cultures and preferences of the<lb/> developing countries concerned <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. In cases where private standards developed by globally<lb/> operating firms fail to take adequate account of local conditions and cultures, the costs of compliance can<lb/> be greater than for standards produced locally <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004; WTO, 2005]</ref>. While there remains the risk of<lb/> market exclusion with high private standards when applied to developing country exporters, with perhaps<lb/> significant trade reduction and diversion effects, the impacts on agricultural and food product trade are<lb/> likely to be complex <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2004]</ref>. As noted, rising private standards can also serve to accentuate<lb/> underlying supply chain strengths and weaknesses and thus impact differently on the competitive position<lb/> of individual developing countries <ref type="biblio">[WTO, 2005]</ref>. For those exporters who do gain access to buyer-driven<lb/> supply chains, the benefits in terms of long term trade relations through participating in systems of<lb/> preferred suppliers can also be very large.<lb/></p>

			<head>G.<lb/> Some conclusions and areas for future research<lb/></head>

			<p>The foregoing would suggest that the relations between public and private sectors in the establishment<lb/> and development of food quality standards are becoming increasingly complex as the numbers of both<lb/> types of standards proliferate and become generally more stringent and varied in their applications in both<lb/> national and international food markets. Private standards are, however a fairly recent phenomenon and are<lb/> still far from universally applied across the world, with public standards remaining the dominant influence<lb/> on some national food markets.<lb/> The interaction of private and public standards in the food system is an area of research that has only<lb/> recently begun to receive some attention. The existing research would suggest that by and large, private<lb/> standards are considered to be complementary to, rather than a substitute for, public norms in governing<lb/> food quality in most national food systems where they are both present. The public standards or norms<lb/> establish the minimum quality requirements for food products and the results to be achieved, while private<lb/> standards elaborate the tools and control processes followed by private firms in meeting and often<lb/> exceeding these standards and regulatory obligations in competing in quality differentiated markets<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>. Private standards can also act as a substitute for missing or ineffective public regulations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[Reardon et al. 2001; Henson and Reardon, 2005]</ref>. This has reportedly been the situation in some least<lb/> developed countries in the past where private standards developed by some multinational food retailers for<lb/> their home markets have been applied also in less developed countries to the advantage of local consumers<lb/> [<ref type="biblio">Reardon and Berdegeue, 2002]</ref>.<lb/> In most cases, private firms in seeking to differentiate their products, achieve market segmentation<lb/> and to signal such changes to consumers to distinguish them from the more generic food items that meet<lb/> the public standards, have built their private standards on the existing public standards infrastructure. That<lb/> is, they follow a strategy of private differentiation from a public minimum quality standard <ref type="biblio">[Codron et al.,<lb/> 2005]</ref>. The level of standards formulated and enforced by governments influence the level of the private<lb/> standards. As public standards become more stringent this can lead to a higher level of private standards to<lb/> maintain a degree of product differentiation and competitive positioning in food markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>The distinction between public and private standards has become less clear cut as the complexity of<lb/> standards has increased over time. In general, private standards have been developed as a means to comply<lb/> with public regulatory requirements. However, there are also instances of government regulations adopting<lb/> the mechanisms employed by private voluntary standards, such as HACCP provisions, and referencing<lb/> private standards in their rules. Private standards may even develop when public regulations already<lb/> provide a high level of food quality in order to pre-empt additional regulatory measures <ref type="biblio">[Lutz et al., 2000]</ref>.<lb/> In his way, private standards may play a role in shaping the content and level of the public regulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The complexity of the interaction of incentives provided by public and private quality standards is<lb/> considerably increased in the context of international trade. While there has been only limited empirical<lb/> analysis of the trade impacts of food quality standards, this has shown that they can play a contrasting role<lb/> in both reducing and enhancing trade in agricultural and food products. However, it is also evident that<lb/> private standards are becoming a primary determinant of market access in some industrial countries and<lb/> that these fall outside the governance structures established by the WTO and the role of the SPS and TBT<lb/> Agreements <ref type="biblio">[Henson, 2006]</ref>.<lb/> In judging the standards system as a whole, there remain many situations where inefficiencies can still<lb/> arise for market participants in responding to a mix of standards that can reduce overall system coherence<lb/> and efficacy [<ref type="biblio">Valceschini and Saulais, 2005]</ref>. These mainly arise in the case of private proprietary<lb/> standards of individual food retailers, and food service companies where standards are not based on any<lb/> sectoral consensus process. Each firm implements its own private voluntary standards, which while similar<lb/> are not necessarily identical and can establish different requirements for supplying firms usually on the<lb/> basis of contractual arrangements. This diversity can imply higher transaction costs and inefficiencies for<lb/> food supplying firms that need to conform to different buyer driven standards in food supply chains. This<lb/> type of problem can also arise for private buying firms operating proprietary standards across national<lb/> borders and subject to various national or international food quality and safety regulations that may have<lb/> different stipulations (e.g. HACCP requirements excluded in France for non-transformed agricultural<lb/> products but required for them under the Codex Alimentarius). Collective private protocols and<lb/> international food system standards (such as ISO 22000] are possible solutions to improve the overall<lb/> coherence of the system of food standards, but are not always available or systematically adopted.<lb/> The foregoing synthesis of the available literature on public and private food standards would suggest<lb/> that research on how these standards interact in regulating national and international food markets is a<lb/> relatively new area of work but one that is receiving increasing attention. It is apparent that differences<lb/> exist between OECD member countries in how the systems of food standards are evolving, and the<lb/> respective roles played by private and public agencies in this process. Future research could focus on<lb/> comparing the situation in the main countries for food quality management and the different roles played<lb/> by public and private sectors in key aspects of the process such as, for example, for product quality<lb/> certification and conformity testing requirements. The objective would be to identify similarities and<lb/> differences in approach and to highlight the reasons for and the main factors involved.</p>
