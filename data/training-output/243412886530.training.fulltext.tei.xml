Growth differential between oil exporters and the rest<lb/> is set to sharpen<lb/> ♦ Growth will accelerate for net oil exporters and weaken slightly for oil importers, strengthening the trends<lb/> projected in African Economic Outlook 2006.<lb/> ♦ For the oil importers, moreover, inflation is moving to double-digit levels.<lb/> ♦ Budget deficits in oil-importing countries appear to have stabilised.<lb/> ♦ The current account deficits of these same countries have increased from 2 per cent in 1998-2004, to<lb/> about 4 per cent since 2005.<lb/> Africa grew by 5.5 per cent in 2006 – well above the<lb/> long-term trend and for the fourth consecutive year. GDP<lb/> per capita grew by about 3.5 per cent. Growth also<lb/> appears set to accelerate somewhat on average in 2007,<lb/> and to remain buoyant in 2008<lb/></table>

			<p>The challenge is to ensure that a large proportion of the<lb/> proceeds from the minerals sector are invested in<lb/> infrastructure and human capital development to support<lb/> medium-and long-term needs for diversification.<lb/> Temporary windfall gains make the re-orientation of<lb/> government budgets urgent. Enhancing transparency and<lb/> combating corruption is key to realising this transformation<lb/> and maintaining growth. The continuation of sound<lb/> macroeconomic polices in most countries on the continent,<lb/> for example, has increased business confidence leading<lb/> to a pickup in private investment generally.<lb/> Oil-importing countries will need to contain inflationary<lb/> pressures now running into double-digits as a result of oil<lb/> price increases, and to finance or contain increases in their<lb/> current account deficits.<lb/></p>

			<p>Meanwhile, contrasts between oil<lb/> exporters and the rest are set to sharpen.<lb/> In 2007 the average real GDP growth rate<lb/> for the continent is expected to be 5.9 per<lb/> cent, with the difference between the two<lb/> groups of countries even more marked at<lb/></p>

			<table>7.4 and 4.7 per cent, respectively.<lb/> Projections for 2008 are for slightly lower<lb/> growth for the oil exporters and about the<lb/> same for the oil-importers as in 2007.<lb/> The economic gains of the oil producers<lb/> are largely due to increasing in oil<lb/> production and sustained high prices. New<lb/> producers – Chad, Equatorial Guinea and<lb/> Mauritania– and those opening up new<lb/> fields – like Angola, which has more than<lb/> doubled its production since 1990 to<lb/> 1.4 million barrels a day in 2006 – were able<lb/> Source: African Economic Outlook 2006/2007.<lb/> No. 14<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 2<lb/> 2 2<lb/> Policy Insights #47, ©OECD 2007<lb/> www.oecd.org/dev/insights<lb/> Policy Insights, No. 47, April 2007<lb/> ODA can help<lb/> Readers are encouraged to quote or reproduce material from OECD<lb/> Development Centre Policy Insights for their own publications.

The resulting windfall gains could set such<lb/> countries firmly on the road to development.<lb/> The oil-importing countries have not been left behind. Metals<lb/> producers also profited from higher world prices and to a<lb/> lesser extent higher export volumes. Mozambique, Namibia,<lb/> South Africa and Zambia all made up for the dearer oil with<lb/> their aluminium, iron, copper and platinum exports.<lb/></table>

			<p>The price of agricultural exports has been falling, hurting<lb/> countries dependent on them, but 2006 turned out not to<lb/> be too bad. Rubber, coffee and seafood exporters enjoyed<lb/> good prices that helped trade balances. Some producers,<lb/> despite weak world prices (of cotton, for example),<lb/> managed to boost exports substantially thanks to good<lb/> weather, and some in Central and East Africa (Madagascar,<lb/> Rwanda and Tanzania) and West Africa (Benin, Burkina<lb/> Faso, Ghana, and Mali) achieved high export growth as<lb/> well. A number of diversified exporters also exhibited strong<lb/> export volume growth (Egypt, Mauritius, Morocco).<lb/> High energy prices may be good for exporters of oil, but<lb/> they can be bad for controlling inflation and the continent<lb/> as a whole saw inflation increase to 9.</p>

			<figure>1 in 2006. This<lb/> continent-wide average masks important differences<lb/> between net oil-exporters and net oil-importers, whose<lb/> figure rose from 8.4 per cent in 2005 to 12 per cent in<lb/> 2006. Further increases, to 12.7 per cent in 2007 and to<lb/> 12.9 per cent in 2008 are expected. That said, only four<lb/> countries (Angola, DRC, Guinea-Bissau, and Zimbabwe)<lb/> experienced inflation rates at or above 20 per cent in 2005,<lb/> and the number remained the same in 2006 ( DRC, Guinea-<lb/>Bissau, São Tomé and Principe and Zimbabwe).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Continuing high oil prices – which seem likely – are a major<lb/> medium-term risk for the continent&apos;s net oil importers and<lb/> may endanger their efforts to maintain macroeconomic<lb/> stability if the financing of the larger current account deficits<lb/> leads to a build up of unsustainable debt levels once again.<lb/> It also makes poverty reduction even harder by putting<lb/> pressure on government budgets.<lb/> African countries need to husband their resources much<lb/> more carefully to pay for the key goals of reducing poverty<lb/> and raising the quality of life for their populations. This<lb/> remains true for both oil-exporting and importing countries.<lb/> The temptation for the former is to waste resources through<lb/> inefficiency and corruption, while for the latter, the challenge<lb/> is to implement policies to sustain and diversify the economy<lb/> in the face of variable world prices.</p>
