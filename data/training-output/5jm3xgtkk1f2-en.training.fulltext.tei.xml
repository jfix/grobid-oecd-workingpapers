			<p>Household debt has risen markedly in most OECD countries since the turn of the century, on the back<lb/> of falling interest rates and innovation in mortgage markets. While the 2008 global financial (and<lb/> economic) crisis (henceforth GFC) triggered deleveraging in some countries, household debt has stabilised<lb/> at a high level or continued to rise in many others. High household debt may entail risks for households,<lb/> the financial system and the wider economy. However, the level of aggregate household debt cannot stand<lb/> alone as an indicator of risks. Rapid increases in debt, often associated with housing booms, are more<lb/> suggestive of upcoming adverse economic and financial developments. These can take many forms.<lb/> Financial distress can result from a deterioration of lending standards, as illustrated by the meltdown of the<lb/> US subprime mortgage market, which was at the epicentre of the 2008 financial crisis. Another source of<lb/> vulnerability is fragile mortgage financing structures, notably involving excessive reliance on short-term<lb/> borrowing. The collapse of the UK mortgage lender Northern Rock in 2007 is a case in point. Finally, even<lb/> in the absence of a direct impact of adverse shocks – such as falls in housing prices, drops in household<lb/> income or increases in interest rates – on the financial system, high household debt may amplify the<lb/> business cycle, as households adjust consumption to cope with their financial obligations. This is<lb/> illustrated by the macroeconomic impact of recent falls in housing prices in Denmark and the Netherlands,<lb/> the two countries with the highest household debt-to-income ratios in the OECD.<lb/> From a policy point of view, rising household debt creates a number of challenges. Assessing<lb/> associated risks is difficult. Aggregate debt levels tell little about the ability of households to repay loans,<lb/> which depends on the distribution of debt, income and wealth across households. Only in a few countries<lb/> are comprehensive household-level data on all these dimensions available, even though national<lb/> authorities, notably central banks, are increasingly working to fill the gaps. The resilience of mortgage<lb/> financing structures to turmoil in financial markets is also difficult to evaluate, particularly when these<lb/> structures are complex and opaque. Systemic risks are even more difficult to grasp, as shown by the US<lb/> subprime crisis, which spread from a relatively small segment of the US mortgage market to global<lb/> finance. Macroeconomic risks associated with high and rising household debt are also fairly difficult to<lb/> assess. A related issue, as a large part of household debt in OECD countries consists of mortgages, is the<lb/> difficulty of identifying housing bubbles in a timely manner. Uncertainties in diagnosis create difficulties<lb/> in designing appropriate policy responses. Furthermore, they can generate political economy<lb/> complications, as support for policies aimed at restraining growth in household debt may be weak,<lb/> especially when these policies have undesirable short-term effects on the economy – e.g. lowering output<lb/> growth and employment – or specific groups – e.g. first-time buyers, banks or homebuilders.<lb/> 1 OECD Economics Department.

			<p>Assuming that action to curb growth in household debt is warranted, policymakers face another<lb/> difficult choice regarding the most appropriate instruments to use. A wide range of instruments can affect<lb/> household debt developments. Unfortunately, most of these instruments have side effects so their choice<lb/> implies difficult trade-offs. Instruments can be broadly sorted into three categories: micro-prudential,<lb/> macro-prudential and monetary policy. Sound micro-prudential regulation and supervision is essential to<lb/> ensure effective risk management and consumer protection. Nevertheless, they may be insufficient to<lb/> contain systemic and macroeconomic risks. Monetary policy is a crude tool to contain household debt,<lb/> among other reasons because this objective may conflict with core objectives of stabilising consumer price<lb/> and output levels. This is particularly the case in the current environment of near-zero policy interest rates<lb/> in many countries. Macro-prudential policies are an appealing alternative, although they are largely<lb/> untested in OECD countries. 2 Finally, in many countries high housing prices and household debt are<lb/> associated with poorly functioning housing markets. Structural features of housing markets influence their<lb/> resilience to shocks coming from the economy or the financial system. A holistic approach to housing<lb/> issues is needed to achieve at the same time financial stability and decent, sustainable housing conditions<lb/> for all.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper is organised as follows. The first section outlines developments in household debt in<lb/> OECD countries over the past two decades. The second one analyses the drivers of debt increases. The<lb/> third section explores the implications of high and rising household debt for financial stability and the<lb/> macroeconomy. The fourth section sketches out policy responses, and the fifth one concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household debt in OECD countries: stylised facts<lb/> Debt levels vary widely across OECD countries<lb/></head>

			<p>The level of gross household debt ranges from less than 60% of net disposable income in some<lb/> Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) to about 290% in the Netherlands and more than 320% in<lb/> Denmark (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Many factors influence the aggregate level of debt, including the depth of the<lb/> financial system, the level of housing prices, demographics, the pension system, social safety nets and<lb/> social attitudes relative to saving and borrowing. Denmark and the Netherlands have suffered sharp<lb/> housing price adjustments recently, which affected macroeconomic performance, but had little direct<lb/> impact on financial stability. The Irish banking system suffered massive losses on property development-<lb/>related loans. Other countries with high household debt levels, including Australia, Canada, Korea,<lb/> Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have sailed through the global downturn without major damage to<lb/> household balance sheets and housing markets. Conversely, some of the countries where the housing<lb/> bubble burst, such as Estonia, Greece, Spain and the United States, had relatively low aggregate household<lb/> debt. As discussed below, while a high level of debt calls for vigilance, many other factors need to be taken<lb/> into account to assess risks to households, financial institutions and the wider economy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Debt has risen rapidly since the turn of the century<lb/></head>

			<p>Gross household debt rose markedly in most OECD countries between the mid-1990s and 2008. On<lb/> average, it roughly doubled as a percentage of income. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> displays the evolution of the debt-to-<lb/>income (DTI) ratio in four groups of countries, using different scales as debt levels vary widely across<lb/> groups of countries. In the Anglo-Saxon group, debt ratios rose rapidly from 1995 to 2007. Trajectories<lb/> diverged subsequently, with deleveraging in the United Kingdom and the United States, while debt<lb/> accumulation continued, albeit at a slower pace, in Australia and Canada. The group of Northern countries<lb/> includes the Nordics and the Netherlands, which share many common features. Although Korea is a very<lb/> different country, it is included in this group, as household debt increases have been similar to those of<lb/> Sweden. However, underlying causes differ, as the rise in debt was associated with rapid increases in<lb/> housing prices in Sweden, but not in Korea. The debt ratio has increased steadily in the Northern group.<lb/> Denmark and the Netherlands, which have the highest household debt levels in the OECD, are the only<lb/> countries in this group where there has been deleveraging recently. The debt ratio increased rapidly from<lb/> relatively low levels in the euro area periphery. The increase was associated with housing bubbles in<lb/> Greece, Ireland and Spain, but not in Italy and Portugal. Although nominal debt is decreasing in all these<lb/> countries, reductions in debt ratios have been limited by drops in income. In Central and Eastern Europe,<lb/> debt ratios have risen from very low levels. In the context of a recently privatised housing stock and<lb/> financial deepening, an increasing debt ratio was to be expected. The process was relatively smooth in<lb/> most countries, but unsustainable indebtedness was followed by sharp adjustments in Estonia and Hungary.<lb/> Structural features of housing and mortgage markets can partly explain divergent evolutions across<lb/> countries (Box 1).<lb/> The DTI ratio shows strong asymmetry. While it increased briskly during the boom, it generally<lb/> decreased little during the downturn (<ref type="biblio">Bouis et al., 2013; MGI, 2015</ref>). This asymmetry largely reflects that<lb/> deleveraging is mainly driven by shrinking inflows into debt, rather than increasing outflows, including<lb/> through defaults (<ref type="biblio">Bhutta, 2012</ref>). 3 The time needed to repair balance sheets is one of the reasons why<lb/> recessions following housing market collapses tend to be protracted. High debt is widely seen as an<lb/> obstacle to growth and financial stability (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2012; IMF, 2015a</ref>). Nevertheless, rapid deleveraging can<lb/> be harmful to growth, particularly if it happens mainly through credit contraction. Recent IMF estimates<lb/> shed light on factors behind deleveraging in a sample of advanced economies between 2007 and 2014<lb/> (IMF, 2015a). In four countries, the gross household debt-to-GDP ratio fell by more than nine points, but<lb/> the reduction was driven by very different factors. In the United Kingdom and the United States, nominal<lb/> GDP growth made a sizeable contribution. Debt write-offs also helped, particularly in the United States,<lb/> where non-recourse mortgages are prevalent. Asset revaluation further improved the net debt-to-GDP ratio,<lb/> as property and stock market rebounded. In Latvia and Spain, deleveraging took a big toll on activity and<lb/> employment, as it occurred mainly through a reduction in net debt issuance, although there were also<lb/> significant debt write-offs. In Greece, gross household debt jumped up almost 18% of GDP, with lower<lb/> output volume more than offsetting reduced debt issuance and no relief from write-offs. Net debt increased<lb/> even more due to asset depreciation. This clearly illustrates the importance of the nature of the<lb/> deleveraging process for growth and financial stability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. Household debt in Hungary and other OECD Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC)<lb/></head>

			<p>After the fall of communism, mortgage lending expanded rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The rise<lb/> of household debt resulted from the privatisation of the housing stock, low interest rates and increased availability of<lb/> credit. Optimistic expectations about income growth supported the build-up of household debt before the crisis, as<lb/> progressive catch-up with older EU members&apos; income levels was anticipated (<ref type="biblio">Chmelar, 2013</ref>). However, housing and<lb/> mortgage markets evolved differently across countries. While in most countries the overwhelming majority of the<lb/> population became homeowners, the Czech Republic moved towards a more balanced tenure structure, with a large<lb/> rental market. The availability of rental housing provided an alternative to owner-occupied housing, especially in cities,<lb/> alleviating pressure on housing demand. The type of mortgage products offered has also been very diverse. While the<lb/> proportion of foreign-currency mortgages was negligible in the Czech and Slovak Republics, it was about 40% of<lb/> outstanding loans in Poland, 70% in Hungary and 80% in Estonia in 2008. The very low share of foreign-currency<lb/> loans in the Czech Republic results from low nominal mortgage rates in the national currency, associated with low<lb/> inflation and high household saving ratios (<ref type="biblio">Lux and Sunega, 2012</ref>).<lb/> The non-performing loan (NPL) ratios increased in all OECD CEEC during the crisis. The rise was relatively<lb/> modest in the Czech and Slovak Republics and Poland. On the contrary, NPL ratios of loans to households rose<lb/> spectacularly in Hungary, reaching about 15% in 2012. This can be partly attributed to the depth of the recession in<lb/> Hungary. However, housing market and especially mortgage market structures also made Hungary less resilient to the<lb/> economic crisis than its neighbours. Homeownership was &quot; the only viable option for obtaining permanent housing &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Lux<lb/> and Sunega, 2012</ref>). Strong policy support for homeownership contributed to increasing demand for owner-occupied<lb/> housing. However, mortgage interest subsidies were cut in 2004, pushing up the cost of mortgages. This resulted in a<lb/> widespread shift in demand towards mortgages in foreign currency, which carried lower interest rates. After 2004, the<lb/> majority of new loans in Hungary were denominated in Swiss francs or in euros. This is an interesting – but not<lb/> unusual – illustration of the perverse effect policy measures may have when behavioural responses are not anticipated<lb/> or at least monitored closely enough. After 2008, the sharp depreciation of the forint increased the loan repayment<lb/> burden 30% to 40% on average (<ref type="biblio">Hegedus et al., 2011</ref>).<lb/> The Hungarian government launched a debt repayment programme in September 2011, which allowed debtors<lb/> to repay their mortgages at an exchange rate about 25% below the market rate during a period of about five months.<lb/> Further measures to lock in preferential exchange rates for five years and to convert non-performing foreign-currency<lb/> mortgages into forints were introduced. However, the impact of these relief programmes on outstanding household<lb/> debt has been modest. Relief schemes seem to have suffered from excessive complexity and poor targeting. In<lb/> particular, only better-off households could afford to repay their loan in a single payment as proposed in the September<lb/> 2011 programme. Another weakness of the rescue programmes was that two-thirds of the cost (of about 1½ per cent<lb/> of GDP in total) was borne by the banks, which had limited capacity to absorb it. This may have worsened the credit<lb/> crunch (IMF, 2012 and 2013). Ultimately, in November 2014, the central bank and the Banking Association agreed to<lb/> rapidly convert foreign-currency mortgages into forint, at the market exchange rate of the date of the decision, to<lb/> reduce the exposure of households to exchange-rate risk (IMF, 2015b).<lb/></p>

			<head>The debt service burden remains low<lb/></head>

			<p>Although household debt stands at a historically high level in most OECD countries, household debt<lb/> service generally remains moderate, as interest rates are also historically low. In the United States, the<lb/> debt-service ratio has varied within a fairly narrow range over the past 35 years and is now close to its<lb/> lower bound, after reaching a peak at the end of 2007 (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, Panel A). Debt service payments are also<lb/> moderate in a sample of other OECD countries, among them some with high DTI ratios, like Australia and<lb/> Sweden (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, Panel B). Debt service ratios have declined, as debt stabilised or receded, while interest<lb/> rates fell steeply. Even if these numbers seem reassuring, a number of facts need to be kept in mind. First,<lb/> the debt service ratio depends on mortgage repayment schedules. For example, the large share of non-<lb/>amortising loans partly explains the low debt service burden in Sweden. Second, interest rates are close to<lb/> historical lows and are likely to rise in the future. In a number of countries, variable mortgage rates are<lb/> prevalent and higher interest rates would rapidly translate into higher debt service payments. The impact<lb/> on the debt service ratio would be somewhat weaker if, as can be expected, interest rates increases coincide<lb/> with rising disposable income. Third, aggregate numbers may mask high debt service burdens for some<lb/> categories of households, which may be particularly vulnerable to interest rate increases or reductions in<lb/> income.<lb/></p>

			<head>At the aggregate level debt is dwarfed by assets<lb/></head>

			<p>Increases in gross household debt have generally been matched by increases in assets. In the major<lb/> seven OECD countries, the sum of financial and non-financial assets is equivalent to a about seven to more<lb/> than nine years of disposable income, while debt is equivalent to well below two years of income. Hence,<lb/> on aggregate, the household sector has high net wealth. Although asset values have fluctuated significantly<lb/> over the period 2001-14, wealth buffers always remained large (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Assets also largely exceed<lb/> liabilities in the countries with the highest household debt ratios, like Denmark and the Netherlands, where<lb/> large amounts of wealth are accumulated in pension and life insurance funds. However, assets such as<lb/> pension savings can generally not be mobilised to repay debt in case of financial difficulties. More<lb/> importantly, aggregate positions mask the distribution of assets and debts. Typically, tenants and a part of<lb/> the homeowners will have little or no debt, assets tend to be concentrated, and a fraction of borrowers are<lb/> vulnerable to adverse shocks, such as reductions in income or unemployment. Therefore, an assessment of<lb/> risks associated with household debt requires data on the distribution of debt and assets across households.<lb/></p>

			<head>Debt is unevenly distributed across households<lb/></head>

			<p>In general, highly indebted households tend to have relatively high incomes and wealth. As an<lb/> illustration, in the euro area, both the percentage of households holding mortgage debt and the amount of<lb/> debt they owe is positively correlated with income (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, first panel). Nevertheless, low-income<lb/> indebted households tend to be more leveraged, to carry a higher debt burden relative to income and to<lb/> have lower liquidity buffers than more affluent ones (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, second panel). In addition, these households<lb/> tend to be more vulnerable to negative income shocks and unemployment. Hence, this segment of the<lb/> market needs to be monitored carefully. Micro data can be used to perform stress tests to assess the<lb/> vulnerability of households to different economic scenarios, notably interest rate increases and falls in<lb/> income and housing prices. For example, <ref type="biblio">Ampudia et al. (2014)</ref> carry out such an exercise for the euro area<lb/> and find that overall euro area households are resilient, but that there is substantial heterogeneity across<lb/> countries. In the early 2000s, economically vulnerable households in the United States, particularly the<lb/> young, low-educated and African-Americans or Hispanics, accumulated large amounts of debt relative to<lb/> income and their assets were largely concentrated in housing. Hence, the households most exposed to the<lb/> consequences of the recession had the weakest and riskiest balance sheets (<ref type="biblio">Boshara and Emmons, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Following the recession, in some Southern European and CEE Countries the share of homeowners<lb/> spending more than 40% of their income on housing costs, although generally lower than for renters, is<lb/> substantial (Eurostat Housing <ref type="biblio">Statistics; Rosenfeld, 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Surveys of household finances are often compiled at relatively long intervals and become available<lb/> with a fairly long lag. This is an important shortcoming for financial supervision and policy making.<lb/> However, this problem can be at least partly overcome and more timely estimates provided, at the price of<lb/> some reasonable approximations. For example, <ref type="biblio">Krimmel et al. (2013)</ref> combine US Survey of Consumer<lb/> Finances data with quarterly macro-level financial accounts data to produce timely estimates of the state of<lb/> household balance sheets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Delinquencies and foreclosures reflect various factors<lb/></head>

			<p>In the run-up to the GFC, mortgage lending soared in most OECD countries. In many cases, the<lb/> expansion was supported by overly optimistic expectations about future economic and housing price<lb/> developments. The crisis resulted in rising arrears, although with large differences across countries.<lb/> Foreclosures rose sharply in the United States, but much less in other countries, partly as a result of<lb/> institutional differences, state interventions and lender forbearance. In many countries, the share of non-<lb/>performing mortgages rose only modestly, in particular because low interest rates alleviated the repayment<lb/> burden. The transmission of lower policy rates to mortgages is especially strong in countries where<lb/> variable rates are prevalent. The United Kingdom provides an illustration. During the downturn of the early<lb/> 1990s, arrears and possessions increased markedly, as high interest rates pushed up the loan servicing<lb/> burden. During the latest recession, low interest rates contained the increase in arrears, although a smaller<lb/> increase in unemployment also contributed (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>).<lb/> Among the countries with the steepest rises in mortgage delinquencies, it is useful to distinguish two<lb/> categories. The first one includes the countries where defaults can be mostly attributed to excessive risk<lb/> taking in mortgage lending, although deteriorating economic conditions also played a role. The US<lb/> subprime crisis is the most obvious example. Countries where mortgages tied to foreign currencies or<lb/> inflation (e.g. Hungary, Iceland) were prevalent also experienced high rates of delinquencies. In this<lb/> category, defaults started early in the crisis. In the United States, where the ability of many subprime<lb/> borrowers to repay their loan was contingent on rising housing prices, defaults and foreclosures<lb/> skyrocketed soon after prices stopped rising in some states around mid-2006 (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). The countries in<lb/> this category are relatively few. This is in line with historical experience, where residential mortgage<lb/> lending has rarely been a source of major financial losses, contrary to loans to real estate developers and<lb/> commercial property. From a policy point of view, failures in financial regulation and supervision can be<lb/> seen as the main culprits for crises associated with lax underwriting practices. Sound micro-prudential<lb/> standards should be able to avoid the repeat of similar episodes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second category creates more policy challenges. Even though some easing of credit standards<lb/> contributed to a housing boom in some cases, defaults on residential mortgages in this category largely<lb/> result from falling income and rising unemployment during the downturn. This is the case of several euro<lb/> area countries, where most of the increase in delinquencies followed the deterioration in economic<lb/> conditions. Countries which had gone through a construction and house price boom, like Ireland and Spain,<lb/> have seen defaults increase sharply (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Defaults also increased, albeit more modestly, in countries<lb/> where housing markets had been relatively stable, like Italy and Portugal. As defaults are largely<lb/> endogenous to the economic situation, they cannot be mainly blamed on poor underwriting, even though<lb/> some financial institutions may have used overly optimistic assumptions in their stress tests during the<lb/> boom. Hence, sound micro-prudential regulations need to be complemented with macro-prudential<lb/> measures to take into account systemic risks and macroeconomic spillovers. It is worth noting, however,<lb/> that Spain requires dynamic provisioning from banks since 2000 (<ref type="biblio">Saurina, 2009</ref>). While this is likely to<lb/> have mitigated credit losses during the downturn, it was not enough to prevent the preceding housing<lb/> boom. Monetary policy can contribute to reining in lending to households in some circumstances, but<lb/> sometimes this may conflict with its primary objective of stabilising inflation and output, as currently in<lb/> Canada, Norway or Sweden. More generally, monetary policy is a crude tool to deal with asset price<lb/> bubbles. Other policies, such as property taxation and land-use planning also have a role to play in<lb/> reducing housing price and construction volatility.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another area which deserves close monitoring is lending to the construction industry and real estate<lb/> developers. Historically, during most recessions associated with tumbling housing prices, financial<lb/> institutions&apos; losses related to commercial property mortgages and loans to developers have been much<lb/> higher than those on residential mortgages. During the latest downturn, non-performing loans have<lb/> weighed heavily on the Irish and Spanish banking sector and public finances, as governments stepped in to<lb/> rescue distressed financial institutions. In Ireland, the government set up in late 2009 the National Asset<lb/> Management Agency (NAMA), a state bank restructuring agency, which acquired 11 500 property<lb/> development-related loans, with a nominal value of €72.3 billion (46% of GDP) at an average haircut of<lb/> 58%. Subsequent capital injections added to the gross direct fiscal cost of the banking crisis. The net long-<lb/>term fiscal cost of bank recapitalisation, although still very uncertain, is now estimated at about 22% of<lb/> GDP (<ref type="biblio">Honohan, 2015</ref>). Spain launched SAREB (Sociedad de Gestión de Activos procedentes de la<lb/> Reestructuración Bancaria) in July 2012 to remove distressed real estate assets from the balance sheets of<lb/> troubled financial institutions. SAREB, of which 55% are owned by the private sector and 45% by the<lb/> government (through the FROB, Fondo de Reestructuratión Bancaria), received nearly 200 000 assets for<lb/> an amount of €50.7 billion euros (about 5% of GDP), of which 80% are financial assets and 20% property.<lb/></p>

			<head>Drivers of household debt<lb/> Debt and housing prices tend to move together<lb/></head>

			<p>Mortgages account for the bulk of household borrowing in OECD countries. Therefore, the focus in<lb/> this paper is on the link between household debt and developments in the housing market. This does not<lb/> imply, however, that consumer credit cannot be the source of serious problems for financial institutions.<lb/> While amounts are much lower than for mortgages, consumer loans tend to be unsecured and more<lb/> prevalent in the lower income categories of households. Hence, default rates and credit losses can be high,<lb/> as illustrated by the Korean credit card crisis in the early 1990s (<ref type="biblio">Kang and Ma, 2009; Jones and Kim,<lb/> 2014</ref>). All forms of credit raise social and consumer protection issues. 4 Nevertheless, from a<lb/> macroeconomic perspective, mortgage debt is most important. 5<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a strong correlation between variations in housing prices and in household debt (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/> This is not surprising, as buying dwellings is the main motive for household borrowing. The causality is<lb/> likely to run in both directions. One the one hand, higher housing prices push households to take on bigger<lb/> loans and increase the value of collateral which can be used to obtain credit. On the other hand, a loosening<lb/> of borrowing constraints allows households to bid for more expensive homes. As supply is inelastic in<lb/> many housing markets, at least in the short run, this pushes prices up. Recent literature provides evidence<lb/> of these interactions. IMF (2011) documents the link between LTV ratios and house prices and credit<lb/> growth for advanced economies. <ref type="biblio">Duca et al. (2011)</ref> show that the easing of mortgage credit conditions in<lb/> the early 2000s in the United States, reflected in higher cyclically-adjusted LTV ratios for first-time<lb/> buyers, pushed up significantly housing price-to-rent ratios. Anundsen and Jansen (2013) estimate a<lb/> structural vector error correction model (SVECM) for Norway over the period 1986Q2-2008Q4 and find a<lb/> two way interaction between housing prices and household borrowing in the long run. Basten and Koch<lb/> (2015) use exogenous shocks to immigration to identify the impact of housing prices on mortgage supply<lb/> and demand in Switzerland, and find two-way causality between housing prices and mortgage debt. Fuster<lb/> and <ref type="biblio">Zafar (2014)</ref> provide survey evidence that willingness to pay for a home increases when required<lb/> down-payments are lowered, especially among poorer and credit-constrained households.<lb/></p>

			<head>Housing prices are determined by a wide range of factors<lb/></head>

			<p>The fundamental determinants of housing prices are well documented in the literature (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Malpezzi,<lb/> 1999; Meen, 2002; Girouard et al., 2006; Muellbauer and Murphy, 2008; Miles and Pillonca, 2008; André,<lb/> 2010</ref>) and are only briefly recalled in this paper. The main fundamental drivers of demand are household<lb/> income, interest rates, credit availability and demographics. Taxation, including property taxes and<lb/> mortgage interest deductibility, also plays a role by affecting the user cost of housing (<ref type="biblio">Poterba, 1984</ref>). The<lb/> response of prices to changes in demand depends on the elasticity of supply, which in turn is affected by<lb/> physical and regulatory constraints (<ref type="biblio">Glaeser et al., 2005; Green et al., 2005; Caldera and Johansson, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Models based on fundamentals tend to explain housing price developments fairly well in the long run. It is<lb/> important to note, however, that having prices in line with fundamentals does not imply that large price<lb/> variations should be ruled out. In fact, housing price determinants can be volatile and elasticities of<lb/> housing prices to these determinants are often high. Hence, shocks to fundamentals can trigger large<lb/> housing price reactions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the current low-interest rate environment, it is worth noting that the relation between interest rate<lb/> and borrowing capacity is highly non-linear. Furthermore, the increase in borrowing capacity associated<lb/> with a fall in the interest rate is larger the longer the duration of the mortgage. For the same reimbursement<lb/> annuity, a 50-year mortgage at a rate of 4% allows borrowing almost three times the amount that could be<lb/> borrowed at a rate of 12% over 20 years (<ref type="biblio">André, 2015</ref>). However, a cap on LTV limits the expansion of<lb/> borrowing capacity, as the increase in the required deposit is proportional to the increase in the loan<lb/> amount. But during the boom which preceded the GFC, mortgage maturities were lengthened and LTV<lb/> constraints eased in many countries. This illustrates how lower interest rates and financial innovation can<lb/> interact to raise borrowing capacity considerably.<lb/> Although housing prices can be fairly well tracked by fundamentals over the long term, they tend to<lb/> overshoot, in some case creating huge bubbles. There is strong evidence of extrapolative housing price<lb/> expectations. Based on recent econometric estimates from several countries, Muellbauer (2012) argues that<lb/> the rate of appreciation of housing prices over the past four years is a good proxy for the expected rate of<lb/> housing price increase. Furthermore, momentum traders who believe it is a good time to buy a house<lb/> because house prices will rise further, can have a sizeable effect on housing prices (<ref type="biblio">Shiller, 2007; Piazzesi<lb/> and Schneider, 2009</ref>). Real estate investors can amplify housing booms. For example, <ref type="biblio">Haughwout et al.<lb/> (2011)</ref> find that in the US states where housing bubbles developed in the 2000s, investors accounted for<lb/> almost half of purchase mortgage originations at the peak of the cycle. Investors have also played an<lb/> important role in housing market and household debt developments in Australia (<ref type="biblio">Yates, 2011</ref>).<lb/> The prevalence of extrapolative price expectations has important implications for housing market<lb/> dynamics. As supply is inelastic in the short term, given the time needed to build dwellings, an increase in<lb/> demand pushes prices up. As prices rise, buyers with backward-looking price expectations tend to enter the<lb/> market, pushing prices up further. A typical example is episodes of financial deregulation, which have<lb/> often been followed by housing bubbles. A recent case is the introduction of interest-only loans in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Denmark in 2003 (Lunde, 2007; Dam et al., 2011</ref>). The easing of borrowing constraints creates a housing<lb/> demand burst. Competition for market share tends to induce lenders to take excessive risks. The<lb/> supervision instruments suited to the new regime are not always in place. As a result credit grows briskly<lb/> and housing prices increase sharply. The rise in the value of collateral allows more credits, a mechanism<lb/> known as the financial accelerator (<ref type="biblio">Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Bernanke et al., 1998; Aoki et al., 2002</ref>).<lb/> Momentum traders and investors may inflate the bubble further. Such dynamic effects call for vigilance<lb/> from policymakers when implementing measures which can be beneficial in the long term but entail<lb/> significant transition risks.<lb/> The impact of an increase in demand for dwellings on the housing market and the economy varies<lb/> with the elasticity of housing supply. In countries where supply is fairly inelastic (e.g. Australia or the<lb/> United Kingdom), prices will stabilise rapidly at a higher level, assuming the shift in demand is permanent.<lb/> In countries where supply is more responsive (e.g. Ireland, Spain or the United States), the combination of<lb/> delays in supply responses – as building takes time, even in countries where supply is elastic – and<lb/> backward-looking price expectations tends to generate a hog-type cycle. Housing prices and construction<lb/> overshoot. Oversupply generates subsequent falls in housing prices and a collapse in construction (<ref type="biblio">André,<lb/> 2015</ref>). The cycle may be amplified by the behaviour of real estate developers taking advantage of local<lb/> monopoly positions (<ref type="biblio">Laszek and Olszewski, 2015</ref>). 6 As loans to the construction and real estate sectors<lb/> tend to generate heavy losses following housing market busts, rapid increases in housing prices associated<lb/> with a fast expansion of construction raises more concern among financial supervisors than those<lb/> accompanied by limited increases in building activity. However, unless the increase in demand is purely<lb/> temporary, low supply elasticity leads to a structural shortage of housing, which implies permanently<lb/> higher housing prices. This leads to affordability problems, with associated social consequences.<lb/> Furthermore, as higher housing prices tend to induce more borrowing, gross household debt will tend to<lb/> increase, potentially creating risks for the stability of the financial system and the economy. Hence, an<lb/> elastic housing supply is in general desirable. Nevertheless, policymakers should keep in mind the risk of<lb/> overshooting in the case of a sudden demand spurt and be ready to take appropriate measures to dampen<lb/> the construction cycle. Closely monitoring lending to building companies, real estate developers and<lb/> investors is essential in that respect.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household debt and financial and macroeconomic stability<lb/></head>

			<p>Debt can increase welfare by allowing households to become homeowners, to finance purchases of<lb/> durable goods and to smooth consumption. However, high indebtedness increases the vulnerability of<lb/> households to adverse events, such as unemployment, drops in income or falls in housing prices. Some of<lb/> these vulnerabilities may be mitigated by country-specific institutional features. For example, a high<lb/> income-replacement rate over a long period in unemployment insurance will limit the risk of default<lb/> associated with a job loss. The consequences of defaulting also vary across countries. For example, non-<lb/>recourse loans in many US states allowed households in negative equity to escape debt, which was much<lb/> more difficult in most other OECD countries. Different types of mortgage contracts (e.g. fixed vs. variable<lb/> rates, local vs. foreign currency, interest-only vs. amortising) also entail different kinds of risks for<lb/> households. Financial institutions, in addition to credit risk, face funding risks, notably in the presence of<lb/> maturity and/or currency mismatches. Countries whose financial institutions can raise stable and long-term<lb/> funding face lower risks for a given level of debt than those where short-term funding, especially from<lb/> abroad, is prevalent. These considerations make it difficult to determine an optimal level of lending, which<lb/> will vary across countries and through time. Moreover, the worst housing crises were not associated with<lb/> the highest levels of debt. Conversely, rapid growth in debt is associated with risks of severe recession.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial stability risks<lb/></head>

			<p>Excessive household debt can entail risks for financial stability. A major difficulty in assessing these<lb/> risks is that they are mostly indirect. In a number of cases, large losses for financial institutions resulted<lb/> directly from excessively risky lending followed by high rates of defaults. This was the case in the United<lb/> States and a number of countries where foreign currency denominated mortgages were common. To some<lb/> extent foreign currency mortgages transform currency risk into credit risk, as household facing much<lb/> higher repayments after large currency depreciations present a higher risk of default. 7 This is illustrated by<lb/> the Icelandic crisis (Box 2). Nevertheless, direct credit risk is generally mild on residential mortgages,<lb/> especially in countries with recourse loans. From a policy point of view, micro-prudential regulation and<lb/> supervision should be able to limit such risks. Indirect risks play through different channels and are more<lb/> difficult to control. The pro-cyclicality of the financial system combined with the housing market dynamics<lb/> described above can generate housing bubbles. Financial institutions may accumulate assets with high risk<lb/> correlations, thereby increasing their vulnerability to defaults or price falls. Commercial mortgages and<lb/> loans to the construction and real estate sectors tend to be correlated and generate big risks, as illustrated<lb/> recently by Ireland and Spain. As discussed below, housing market busts often generate outsized effects on<lb/> the wider economy, which in turn cause defaults on both household and corporate loans, as well as losses<lb/> on financial assets.<lb/> Risks are amplified by concentration. Banks in OECD economies are increasingly exposed to real<lb/> estate. <ref type="biblio">Jordá et al. (2014)</ref> show that, in a sample of 17 advanced economies, the share of mortgages in bank<lb/> lending has roughly doubled over the past century to reach about 60%. Total bank lending has grown to<lb/> 112% of GDP in 2007. Bank leverage hit a peak in 2007 and remains high by historical standards. High<lb/> leverage partly reflects the perception that residential mortgages present low risks. There is, however, a<lb/> paradox. On the one hand, banks perceive mortgage lending as safe because in most cases few households<lb/> default, even when housing bubbles burst. On the other hand, mortgage lending can fuel housing bubbles,<lb/> whose bursting may cause great damage to the economy and the financial system. This creates a major<lb/> tension for policymakers, which is exacerbated in the current very low interest rate and abundant liquidity<lb/> environment. As discussed below, macro-prudential tools can be used to address this challenge.<lb/> In addition to credit risk, the funding structure of mortgage lenders tends to be vulnerable, as they<lb/> typically engage in maturity transformation. Mortgage loans generally have a very long duration, but they<lb/> are often funded through relatively short term and unstable sources. Traditionally, banks used to fund a<lb/> large fraction of mortgages through deposits, even though Denmark and Germany have used covered<lb/> bonds for more than two centuries and the United States has used mortgage-backed securities for decades.<lb/> However, mortgages have been increasingly funded through wholesale funding, particularly during the<lb/> boom which preceded the GFC. While wholesale funding is not a problem in itself, maturity mismatches<lb/> and opacity have created vulnerabilities. 8<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The Icelandic crisis<lb/></head>

			<p>Between 2004 and 2008, Iceland experienced one of the most spectacular boom-bust cycles in history, which<lb/> resulted in the collapse of its three largest banks within days in October 2008. The housing boom, while sharing<lb/> characteristics with contemporaneous or past housing bubbles in other countries, originated in a financing model which<lb/> combined an impressive number of weaknesses, ranging from a rapid loosening of lending standards and weak<lb/> financial regulation and supervision to large maturity and currency mismatches between assets and liabilities of banks.<lb/> Mortgages were only one of the areas of unsustainable banking expansion. While mortgage debt amounted to slightly<lb/> over 100% of GDP at the peak of the housing boom, the assets of the three major banks reached about 10 times GDP<lb/> in 2008 (<ref type="biblio">Guðmundsson, 2012</ref>). The housing boom started when the mortgage market was deregulated in 2004,<lb/> leading to the entry of the recently privatised banks. Loan-to-value and mortgage amount limits were progressively<lb/> increased. With low interest rates, rapid economic growth and a generous mortgage interest tax credit, demand for<lb/> housing soared, pushing real prices up by more than 50% between August 2004 and October 2007 in the Reykjavik<lb/> region (Skulason, 2012). Mortgage rates were generally linked to the consumer price index (CPI). From 2006 onwards,<lb/> rising interest rates on loans in Icelandic krona led banks to increasingly offer mortgages linked to foreign currencies,<lb/> notably the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. As a result of foreign currency or CPI-indexation, the debt burden of<lb/> households soared in 2008 when the krona depreciated by more than 50% in effective terms, pushing the inflation rate<lb/> to about 17%. Nearly a quarter of homeowners had debt service exceeding 40% of their disposable income at the end<lb/> of 2008. As housing prices declined, the share of homeowners in negative equity rose to close to 40% in 2010 (IMF,<lb/> 2012).<lb/></figure>

			<p>The collapse of the three main banks compelled the government to establish new banks. Contrary to bank rescue<lb/> operations in many other countries, where governments supported a large share of the losses, the Icelandic bank<lb/> resolution left the creditors of the three major banks with heavy losses, amounting to €45 billion. Measures also had to<lb/> be taken to restructure household debt, which the devaluation of the krona, the associated inflation spike and the<lb/> deterioration of the economic situation had made unsustainable. Social pressure on the government to provide relief to<lb/> indebted households was strong. The first measures included a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and a<lb/> temporary freeze of debt service pending rescheduling of payments on CPI and exchange rate-linked mortgages.<lb/> Bankruptcy law was also amended to allow earlier exit, which increased the negotiating power of debtors against<lb/> creditors. In June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that linking loans denominated in krona to exchange rates was illegal<lb/> and the principal of the loans was cut to the original principal plus accrued interests. The reduction on a loan amounted<lb/> in some cases to as much as 50%. Meanwhile, many households with CPI-indexed mortgages were still struggling,<lb/> and while freezing and rescheduling repayments provided short-term relief and some debt agreements were being<lb/> restructured on a case-by-case basis, more systematic debt restructuring was needed for highly indebted households.<lb/> In December 2010, the government and financial authorities announced a plan to allow writing off mortgage debt<lb/> exceeding 110% of the property value under specific conditions. Overall, household debt written off amounted to more<lb/> than 12% of GDP at end-2011 (<ref type="biblio">Skulason, 2012</ref>). Such debt restructuring has undoubtedly helped the recovery of the<lb/> Icelandic economy and the stabilisation of the housing market. While the Icelandic case illustrates the advantages of<lb/> household debt restructuring, its relevance for other economies should not be overstated, as the costs were largely<lb/> born by foreign lenders, which held a large share of bank debt.<lb/></p>

			<p>The securitisation of subprime loans in the United States was accompanied by the creation of opaque<lb/> financing chains involving structured financial products which became very difficult to value once it<lb/> became obvious that defaults on subprime loans were set to increase dramatically. The underwriting and<lb/> securitisation process was plagued by asymmetries of information, perverse incentives and conflicts of<lb/> interest; lending standards were relaxed as risks could be transferred to investors; rating agencies receiving<lb/> fees from the issuers of the securities they rated were inclined to underestimate risks; and compensation<lb/> structures within financial institutions encouraged excessive risk taking and short-termism. Funding<lb/> mechanisms encouraged unsustainable lending, which fuelled the housing bubble, and complicated the<lb/> resolution of the crisis by increasing uncertainty about potential losses for financial institutions and<lb/> investors, and by hampering debt restructuring. Furthermore, the opacity of financial structures contributed<lb/> to the international spillover of the subprime crisis, even though the latter may only have been the spark<lb/> that ignited the GFC, as it revealed widespread weaknesses in the global financial system (<ref type="biblio">Kamin and<lb/> DeMarco, 2010</ref>).<lb/> The case of the United Kingdom illustrates the vulnerability of mortgage lenders to maturity<lb/> mismatches, even when mortgage arrears do not increase dramatically. UK mortgage lenders had become<lb/> increasingly reliant on wholesale funding, in particular via the securitisation of mortgages. In 2001, lending<lb/> by domestic UK banks to non-bank borrowers was comparable to domestic deposits. By 2008, the funding<lb/> gap between retail deposits and lending had grown to £738 billion (about 50% of GDP), with almost half<lb/> of it filled by interbank deposits from abroad. Wholesale funding allowed very rapid growth in mortgage<lb/> lending. For example, the average annual growth rate of loans by Northern Rock between 2001 and 2006<lb/> was over 30% (<ref type="biblio">Onado, 2009</ref>). When the US subprime market collapsed, liquidity evaporated and demand<lb/> for mortgage-backed securities vanished, leaving banks unable to fund their portfolios and the government<lb/> was forced to bail out several prominent mortgage lenders (<ref type="biblio">André, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Mortgage securitisation has been hit severely by the US subprime crisis. However, it can make a<lb/> valuable contribution to housing finance, provided it is done in a sensible way (<ref type="biblio">Buiter, 2009</ref>). The<lb/> experience of securitisation of prime mortgages in the United States has been fairly positive for decades.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Albertazzi et al. (2011)</ref> find a low probability of default in a large sample of Italian securitised mortgages,<lb/> as banks have applied stringent underwriting standards to build up a reputation among investors. Overall,<lb/> securitisation can be an efficient tool for mortgage finance, provided underwriting is sound and products<lb/> are transparent, allowing investors to assess risks reliably. A requirement for issuers of mortgage-backed<lb/> securities to retain a significant part of the risk can mitigate risks related to asymmetries of information.<lb/></p>

			<p>Covered bonds are more widely used than mortgage-backed securities in several European countries.<lb/> They are generally considered particularly safe for investors as they offer dual recourse to both the<lb/> mortgage pool and the issuer. But as a consequence, they generate &quot; asset encumbrance &quot; , i.e. assets are not<lb/> available to other creditors in the event of the bank&apos;s insolvency. They are often over-collateralised on an<lb/> ongoing basis, providing an additional guarantee to investors. European covered bonds performed<lb/> relatively well during the financial crisis compared to asset-backed securities and senior bank debt (ECB<ref type="biblio">,<lb/> 2008; Blommestein et al., 2011; Campbell, 2012</ref>). There is nevertheless a need for continued vigilance to<lb/> ensure that covered bonds remain very safe investments. On the side of banks, financing through covered<lb/> bonds may still entail refinancing risks if the maturity of the bonds is short compared to that of the<lb/> mortgages.<lb/></p>

			<head>Macroeconomic risks<lb/></head>

			<p>Housing affects economic and financial developments via several channels. Housing has a large<lb/> macroeconomic impact through residential investment, employment and consumption, which is abundantly<lb/> documented in the literature. <ref type="biblio">Leamer (2007)</ref> argues that housing plays a prominent role in the US business<lb/> cycle. A number of studies using structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models also show strong<lb/> spillovers between housing and the wider economy (<ref type="biblio">Goodhart and Hofmann, 2008; Jarocinski and Smets,<lb/> 2008; Iacoviello and Neri, 2010; Musso et al., 2011; André et al., 2012; Gustafsson et al., 2015</ref>). A number<lb/> of studies analyse links between housing and credit and show that housing crises tend to be associated with<lb/> financial crises and protracted recessions (<ref type="biblio">Detken and Smets, 2004; ECB, 2005; Cecchetti, 2008; Claessens<lb/> et al. 2008; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; IMF, 2011; Jordá et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="biblio">Sutherland and Hoeller (2012)<lb/></ref> explore the links between debt and macroeconomic stability and find that when private sector debt levels,<lb/> particularly for households, rise above trend the likelihood of recession increases. Furthermore, when debt<lb/> levels are high, recessions tend to be more severe.<lb/> Several studies have found an impact of housing wealth on private consumption, which tends to be<lb/> larger in countries with the most sophisticated mortgage markets, in particular Anglo-Saxon countries and<lb/> the Netherlands (<ref type="biblio">Catte et al., 2004; Lettau and Ludvigson, 2004; Ludwig and Slok, 2004; Case et al., 2005;<lb/> Muellbauer and Murphy, 2008</ref>). The correlation between estimated propensities to consume out of housing<lb/> wealth and the completeness of mortgage markets and particularly the possibility of housing equity<lb/> extraction, points to the role of collateral. The pure aggregate housing wealth effect should in theory be<lb/> small. Increases in housing wealth are offset by the increase in the value of future rents and only<lb/> distributional effects across households with different propensities to consume affect aggregate<lb/> consumption in the absence of borrowing constraints. But the increase in collateral allows credit-<lb/>constrained households to borrow against the value of their home and raise their level of consumption.<lb/> When house prices fall, this effect is reversed and highly indebted households are forced to reduce<lb/> consumption and to deleverage, as they are unable to raise new loans.<lb/> Recent studies using sub-national or micro data confirm the strong relation between household<lb/> balance sheets and consumption. Most of them attribute a key role to credit constraints in this relation.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Dynan (2012)</ref> shows that highly leveraged US households reduced consumption more than other<lb/> households between 2007 and 2009, despite experiencing smaller changes in net worth. <ref type="biblio">Mian et al. (2013)<lb/></ref> find that the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is highest in areas of the United States<lb/> with poorer and more leveraged households, which are facing the tightest credit constraints. Aladangady<lb/> (2014) finds that US households with a high debt service ratio have a high marginal propensity to consume<lb/> out of housing wealth, contrary to those with a low debt service ratio. This can be seen as evidence of the<lb/> importance of the collateral effect, as opposed to the pure wealth effect, in the relation between housing<lb/> wealth and consumption. <ref type="biblio">Baker (2014)</ref> finds that high indebtedness increases the sensitivity of<lb/> consumption to income shocks among US households and that this result is largely related to borrowing<lb/> and liquidity constraints. <ref type="biblio">Bunn (2014)</ref> finds that highly indebted households in the United Kingdom cut<lb/> spending more than less leveraged ones after 2007, reversing stronger pre-crisis consumption growth. He<lb/> presents survey evidence that lower spending was associated with a combination of tighter credit<lb/> constraints and concerns about ability to make future debt repayments. Lau <ref type="biblio">Andersen et al. (2014)</ref> find that<lb/> highly leveraged Danish households also reduced consumption more than less leveraged ones after 2007,<lb/> correcting unsustainable pre-crisis consumption levels. The relation between leverage and subsequent<lb/> consumption growth is non-linear, with negative correlation found above a LTV ratio of 40%.<lb/> Interestingly, the authors find little evidence that the correlation between leverage and consumption in<lb/> Denmark is driven by credit constraints and rather emphasise the role of precautionary savings and<lb/> revisions to income expectations when the crisis hit. Van <ref type="biblio">Beers et al. (2015)</ref> find a negative relation<lb/> between house price changes and savings in a large panel of Dutch households over the period 2006-11,<lb/> with the strongest response for young households with negative equity, consistent with the presence of<lb/> credit constraints.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy responses<lb/></head>

			<p>Different classes of policy instruments can be used to prevent excessive increases in household debt.<lb/> Sound micro-prudential regulations and supervision is essential. However, the pro-cyclicality of the<lb/> financial system and risks related to correlated exposures across institutions and interconnections call for<lb/> macro-prudential tools to complement micro-prudential measures. The border between micro-and macro-<lb/>prudential instruments is sometimes fuzzy. Many macro-prudential instruments have their origin in the<lb/> micro-prudential toolkit, but may be used not only to ensure the safety of individual financial institutions,<lb/> but also to influence aggregate debt development to prevent systemic and macroeconomic risks. Many<lb/> reforms are currently being implemented to reinforce the stability and resilience of the financial system,<lb/> including Basel III regulations and a wide range of country-specific measures. In this paper, the discussion<lb/> is limited to the aspects of these reforms which are most directly related to the issue of household debt.<lb/> Monetary policy is a blunt tool to control household debt developments, but may be used in cases where<lb/> this does not conflict with inflation and output stabilisation. Structural features of housing markets may<lb/> amplify or dampen the impact of financial shocks on household debt. A holistic approach to housing issues<lb/> is needed to achieve at the same time financial stability and decent housing conditions for all.<lb/></p>

			<head>Micro-prudential policy<lb/></head>

			<p>The boom period preceding the GFC saw a relaxation of lending standards in many OECD countries.<lb/> The US subprime market was an extreme case, where the ability of many borrowers to repay their loans<lb/> depended on ever rising housing prices and the possibility to refinance mortgages at a lower interest rate.<lb/> On a much smaller scale, &quot; equity lending &quot; , which puts more weight on the value of collateral than on the<lb/> repayment capacity of borrowers, also expanded in the United Kingdom, where it was driven by non-bank<lb/> lenders, and resulted in high arrears (FSA, 2009). The &quot; equity lending &quot; model is clearly unsustainable and<lb/> lenders should make sure borrowers have the financial capacity to repay their loans out of income or by<lb/> selling assets under plausible conditions. During the boom, documentation of income and assets of<lb/> borrowers was often neglected. Going forward, financial authorities need to make sure lending standards<lb/> are sound, both in the bank and non-bank sectors. It is important that originators of loans do not face<lb/> incentives encouraging excessive risk taking. Requiring more transparency and reinforcing consumer<lb/> protection and financial education also encourages sound lending and borrowing practices. 9<lb/></p>

			<p>In a period of very low interest rates, variable mortgage rates may induce households to take<lb/> excessively big mortgages if they fail to take into account that interest rates are likely to rise at some point<lb/> during the life of the mortgage. It is often argued that fixed rate mortgages are preferable for this reason.<lb/> However, fixed-rate mortgages have their own drawbacks. Cuts in policy rates provide relief to borrowers<lb/> with variable-rate mortgages. As discussed earlier, this has played a role in limiting defaults in many<lb/> countries. With fixed rates, the transmission mechanism is weaker. In some cases mortgages can be<lb/> refinanced at lower rates, but there may be obstacles. In the United States, many mortgages fell into<lb/> negative equity after 2007, preventing refinancing. In some countries, such as France, there are pre-<lb/>payment penalties. If such penalties do not exist, financial institutions may be exposed to pre-payment<lb/> risk. 10 On balance, it is not obvious that either type of mortgage should be preferred and measures<lb/> distorting the choice of borrowers should probably be avoided, as the most suitable product depends in part<lb/> on the profile of the borrower (<ref type="biblio">Miles, 2004</ref>). One way to avoid that households take on excessive debt<lb/> when interest rates are low in countries where variable rates are predominant is to make affordability<lb/> calculations using as a benchmark a fully amortising loan of a reasonable duration at a representative long-<lb/>term rate. This method has, for example, been recommended by the Finnish Financial Supervisory<lb/> Authority and required for insured mortgages in Canada.<lb/> Some features of mortgages tend to be associated with higher default risks, although the correlation is<lb/> far from perfect, as individual characteristics of borrowers are critical. High loan-to-value (LTV) ratio<lb/> loans increase the probability that households fall into negative equity. Regulatory caps on LTV are in<lb/> place in a number of countries and in some others regulator or industry guidelines recommend a maximum<lb/> LTV (see below for the macro-prudential use of LTVs). Limits are also imposed for mortgages included in<lb/> covered bond pools. Low LTV ratios create a buffer for borrowers in case housing prices fall. However,<lb/> they penalise first-time buyers. Caps on LTV can often be circumvented through the use of consumer<lb/> credit or second lien mortgages to finance the requested deposit. For example, at the peak of the housing<lb/> market in the United States, 45% of home purchases in coastal markets and bubble locations involved a<lb/> second lien (<ref type="biblio">Lee et al., 2012</ref>). A national credit register recording all loans may be necessary to avoid<lb/> circumvention of lending limits (IMF, 2014). Caps on loan-to-income (LTI) or debt-to-income ratios (DTI)<lb/> also exist in some countries. Analysis of the UK mortgage market suggests that from a micro-economic<lb/> point of view caps on LTV, LTI and DTI are not a very efficient way to reduce mortgage risk and come at<lb/> the cost of denying access to credit to some households who could afford it (FSA, 2009). A more flexible<lb/> way to contain risks is to impose higher capital requirements or mortgage insurance for high LTV loans.<lb/> Making insurance compulsory for some types of loans removes the risk of adverse selection. Insurance<lb/> schemes still need to be designed to mitigate moral hazard. As discussed below, caps on LTV, LTI and<lb/> DTI are sometimes used as macro-prudential instruments.<lb/> A number of mortgage product characteristics should be monitored carefully, especially when they<lb/> are used to increase borrowing capacity. Some products designed for a niche market have tended to spread<lb/> to a wide customer base during the latest boom, as they allowed increasing affordability, albeit at the cost<lb/> of higher risks than traditional mortgages, both for borrowers and lenders. For example, loans with<lb/> deferred repayment may be suited for young professionals with good prospects of rising income. However,<lb/> they have sometimes been extended to borrowers with very uncertain ability to repay in the future. Low-<lb/>documentation loans have traditionally been granted to self-employed who could not document a steady<lb/> stream of income. But they were also extended to salaried workers, creating an incentive to overstate their<lb/> income if not properly checked. Indeed, according to the UK Financial Services Authority, for 49% of all<lb/> UK regulated mortgage sales in 2007, incomes were not verified (FSA, 2009). Foreign currency mortgages<lb/> are suited for borrowers with revenue in foreign currency, but were increasingly extended to domestic<lb/> currency income earners in order to take advantage of lower foreign currency interest rates, making these<lb/> borrowers vulnerable to exchange rate risks. 11 In some Central and Eastern Europe countries they<lb/> accounted for a large fraction of originations before the GFC. Interest-only mortgages tended to be used in<lb/> combination with savings products, mainly for tax reduction. In countries where mortgage interest is tax<lb/> deductible, there is an incentive to defer the repayment of the mortgage. In order to ensure that the<lb/> borrower builds up capital to repay the loan at some point, savings can be accumulated in investment<lb/> products (which sometimes also benefit from tax advantages). In 1995, 69% of new mortgages in the<lb/> Netherlands were interest-only, of which only 14% were not associated with an investment product. The<lb/> corresponding numbers for the United Kingdom were 62% and 10%. In 2006, interest-only mortgages<lb/> accounted for nearly 88% of new loans in the Netherlands, of which 44% were not associated with an<lb/> investment product. In the United Kingdom, as mortgage interest deductibility had been phased out,<lb/> interest-only loans accounted for only 24% of new loans, but most of them (20%) were not coupled with an<lb/> investment vehicle (<ref type="biblio">Lunde et al., 2008</ref>). This suggests that during the boom many borrowers chose<lb/> interest-only loans for affordability reasons and had unclear repayment strategies.<lb/> These examples show that risks relate more to mismatches between the products used by some<lb/> households and their financial capabilities and ability to bear risks, than to the products themselves.<lb/> Narrowing the range of products financial institutions may distribute entails welfare costs, as this will<lb/> eliminate products which are likely to be suitable for some categories or borrowers. Furthermore, bans on<lb/> products (be it mortgage-related or other products) may be easily circumvented through financial<lb/> engineering or supplied by institutions outside the regulatory perimeter. Conversely, there is a risk of<lb/> stifling the development of new products. While financial innovation can entail risks, some new products<lb/> could meet borrowers&apos; needs better than those currently available and bring more stability to housing<lb/> finance (<ref type="biblio">Miles and Pillonca, 2008; Shiller et al., 2011</ref>). More flexible measures, such as restrictions on use,<lb/> underwriting guidelines and incentives may be more efficient. For example, bank regulators in Poland have<lb/> requested tighter underwriting conditions for foreign-currency loans. Consumer protection regulation has<lb/> also an important role in preventing unsustainable mortgage lending. 12 Policy makers should take into<lb/> account that taking out a mortgage is one of the most important and financially significant decisions to be<lb/> made by a consumer during their lifetime. 13<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to monitoring lending standards, regulators need to make sure mortgage lenders and<lb/> insurers have adequate capital and liquidity buffers. In particular, the resilience of funding models needs to<lb/> be evaluated carefully in a world where capital flows are volatile. Large maturity and currency mismatches<lb/> should raise concern. While some institutions may be vulnerable because of their own business model,<lb/> weaknesses may also result from systemic risks. This justifies complementing micro-prudential regulations<lb/> by macro-prudential policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Macro-prudential policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the GFC, which has highlighted the role of systemic linkages in the build-up of financial<lb/> imbalances and the propagation of shocks, there is a growing consensus in favour of macro-prudential<lb/> policies among academics and policy makers (<ref type="biblio">Hanson et al., 2011; Galati and Moessner, 2011</ref>). In<lb/> addition, the current very low interest rates and abundant liquidity risk fuelling asset bubbles. Housing<lb/> prices are rising fast in countries with fairly solid economies, like Australia, Canada, Norway and Sweden.<lb/> As policy rates are being kept low to support the economy and in some cases fight deflation, other<lb/> instruments are needed to rein in unsustainable increases in debt. Nevertheless, macro-prudential policies<lb/> are largely untested in advanced countries and building an effective macro-prudential policy framework is<lb/> a major challenge. Emerging economies have used macro-prudential tools more than OECD countries and<lb/> some lessons may be drawn from their experience. 14<lb/> Macro-prudential policy is meant to address systemic fragilities. More precisely, it aims at mitigating<lb/> a fundamental market failure. Individual financial institutions generally fail to appreciate the impact of<lb/> their actions on the financial system as a whole and the risks related to correlated exposures and<lb/> interconnectedness. De <ref type="biblio">Nicolò et al. (2012)</ref> identify three externalities, whose correction they see as<lb/> intermediate targets to mitigate market failures which generate systemic risk. First, strategic<lb/> complementarities – e.g. increased competition during booms, incentive structure of bank managers,<lb/> prospect of a government bailout – induce financial institutions to take excessive or correlated risk during<lb/> cyclical upswings, amplifying credit and liquidity cycles and asset price volatility. Second, externalities<lb/> arise from fire sales during a contraction, which weaken balance sheets and may degenerate into a negative<lb/> spiral between asset prices and balance sheet contraction. Third, interconnectedness propagates shocks<lb/> through financial networks in which systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) play a major role.<lb/> These externalities can be reduced using a wide variety of instruments. Some are general, such as counter-<lb/>cyclical capital buffers, limits on bank leverage or reserve requirements. Others are targeted at specific<lb/> areas. This paper focuses on macro-prudential measures specifically targeting household debt. These are<lb/> especially relevant, as mortgage lending is generally perceived as a low-risk activity by banks, but often<lb/> accounts for a large share of banks&apos; balance sheets and can fuel housing bubbles, whose bursting<lb/> historically led to deep and protracted recessions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most widely used instrument targeting household debt directly is a cap on LTV ratios, which<lb/> exists in about half of advanced economies and an even higher proportion of emerging countries (<ref type="biblio">Mitra,<lb/> 2015</ref>). In some instances, it is complemented by debt-to-income or debt service-to-income limits.<lb/> However, in most cases it is not used as a macro-prudential tool, i.e. it is not adjusted in a dynamic way to<lb/> take into account evolving risks. Nevertheless, a number of experiences suggest a LTV cap can be a useful<lb/> macro-prudential tool:<lb/>  Hong Kong, China 15 has been, since the early 1990s, one of the most active users of LTV caps as<lb/> a macro-prudential tool to prevent the build-up of systemic risk and dampen housing market<lb/> fluctuations. Motivations for using macro-prudential tools include a currency peg with the US<lb/> dollar, which constrains monetary policy, and volatile capital flows. The maximum LTV ratio is<lb/> the main instrument. It varies with the value of the property and is complemented by other tools,<lb/> such as a maximum debt servicing ratio. Macro-prudential policy has been successful in reducing<lb/> household leverage and containing delinquencies following housing price falls. The impact on<lb/> housing market fluctuations seem to have been more modest. Mortgage insurance programmes,<lb/> which allow higher LTVs for insured mortgages, have mitigated the liquidity constraint on first-<lb/>time buyers (<ref type="biblio">Wong et al, 2011</ref>).<lb/>  Korea has actively used LTV limits since 2002 and DTI limits since 2005. These limits vary with<lb/> the type of area (e.g. speculative, metropolitan), the value of the housing unit and some<lb/> characteristics of the loan or the borrower. Over time the limits were extended from covering<lb/> banks and insurance companies to all financial institutions to avoid circumvention. LTV and DTI<lb/> caps appear to have dampened transaction and housing price increases. LTV tightening seems to<lb/> have a greater effect on prices than DTI tightening. Interestingly, rising LTV caps seems to lower<lb/> house price expectations and to affect investors more than first-time buyers (<ref type="biblio">Igan and Kang,<lb/> 2011</ref>). This finding is important given the role of expectations in the formation of housing<lb/> bubbles and the usual concern that LTV caps may disproportionately harm first-time buyers. It is<lb/> also important to note that Korea&apos;s housing policies, in particular measures to improve<lb/> affordability by stimulating the supply of housing, have also contributed to stabilise housing<lb/> prices and facilitated the task of macro-prudential policies. 16<lb/>  New Zealand has introduced in 2013 a limit on the share of high-LTV new mortgages, in<lb/> response to strong increases in housing prices. Banks are not allowed to issue more than 10% of<lb/> new residential mortgages with a LTV over 80%. This &quot; speed limit &quot; approach provides flexibility<lb/> for banks to extend high LTV loans to some customers with a suitable risk profile, while<lb/> containing risks to financial stability (<ref type="biblio">Spencer, 2013</ref>). Besides, minimum risk weights on high-<lb/>LTV mortgages have been increased. Increases in housing prices have slowed significantly<lb/> following the implementation of these measures.<lb/></p>

			<p> Canada requires mortgage insurance for residential mortgages with a LTV ratio above 80%. As<lb/> housing prices continued rising rapidly, prudential regulations on government-backed mortgage<lb/> insurance were tightened in several steps since 2008. In particular, the maximum LTV ratio was<lb/> reduced from 100% to 95% (80% for investment and refinancing), the maximum amortisation<lb/> period was reduced from 40 to 25 years, and the five-year fixed-rate mortgage was imposed as<lb/> the benchmark for evaluating repayment capacity. These measures seem to have pushed banks to<lb/> reduce their share of high-risk mortgages (<ref type="biblio">Cheung, 2014</ref>). They also seem to have slowed overall<lb/> mortgage credit growth and housing price appreciation (<ref type="biblio">Krznar and Morsink, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Nevertheless, housing prices have continued to increase and may have been overvalued by 10%<lb/> to 30% in the third quarter of 2014 (Bank of <ref type="biblio">Canada, 2014</ref>).<lb/>  Some Nordic countries have also moved towards lower LTV limits. Sweden has imposed an 85%<lb/> cap in 2010. Mortgage debt growth has slowed after the introduction of the cap and stress tests<lb/> suggest that the resilience of households to various shocks has increased (<ref type="biblio">Braconier et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> The Financial Supervisory Authorities of Finland and Norway have also lowered their<lb/> recommended maximum LTVs to respectively 90% and 85%. Denmark has had a maximum<lb/> LTV of 80% for residential properties since the end of the 1980s and lower LTV limits for other<lb/> type of properties (<ref type="biblio">Lunde, 2015</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head></head>

			<table>Israel has limited the LTV ratio to 75% for first-time buyers and to 50% for investors since<lb/> November 2012. These caps are complemented by limits on the variable rate component of loans,<lb/> a 50% limit on the payment-to-income (PTI) ratio, a maximum loan term of 30 years, higher<lb/> capital requirements for the riskiest loans and a supplementary reserve requirement for housing<lb/> loans. These measures have led to a decline in the share of variable-rate mortgages and average<lb/> LTV and PTI ratios and to higher mortgage rates. As of mid-2015, real housing prices had<lb/> decelerated somewhat.<lb/></table>

			<p>Beyond the LTV at the origination of the loan, an important consideration is the evolution of the LTV<lb/> over the life of the loan. With amortising loans, the LTV ratio will tend to decrease steadily, barring sharp<lb/> housing price falls. In other words, only recent mortgages will have a high LTV ratio. But in many<lb/> countries, amortisation periods are very long. In some interest-only loans are prevalent. Then, the whole<lb/> mortgage portfolio is large compared to the value of housing assets and households have narrow equity<lb/> buffers. They risk falling into negative equity if prices decline. For example, in the Netherlands, where<lb/> interest-only loans make up a large share of the mortgage stock, about 40% of households were in negative<lb/> equity in 2013 (<ref type="biblio">Kierzenkowski et al., 2014</ref>). In countries with recourse loans, negative equity may not<lb/> trigger many defaults. Nevertheless, it lowers collateral and may also lock in some households in their<lb/> dwellings. Another concern is that households may take out debt they will have difficulties to repay. As<lb/> noted earlier, households may accumulate financial assets and thus reduce their net debt. But this is not<lb/> necessarily the case. Hence, low amortisation entails risks for lenders. As discussed earlier, indebted<lb/> households tend to reduce consumption more than others when facing an economic shock, which can<lb/> amplify cyclical fluctuations. Hence, some countries are trying to encourage amortisation. The Netherlands<lb/> has recently restricted mortgage interest tax deductibility to amortising loans. The Swedish Financial<lb/> Stability Authority has encouraged amortisation and has proposed a formal requirement to amortise for<lb/> mortgages with a LTV over 50%, although this has been blocked by a recent court ruling (<ref type="biblio">Berg and<lb/> Hansen, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Higher minimum risk weights on residential mortgages can also rein in mortgage lending by<lb/> increasing capital requirements for banks, which are likely to push up mortgage rates somewhat. As default<lb/> rates on mortgages are low in many countries, risk weights determined through internal bank models are<lb/> also low. But systemic risk can justify higher risk weights. Therefore, some financial authorities have<lb/> increased minimum risk weights on mortgages (or some categories) in recent years, notably in Belgium,<lb/> Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Hong Kong, China.<lb/></p>

			<p>Dynamic provisioning has been used in Spain since 2000. It allows banks to build financial buffers<lb/> during booms. It also provides investors with a more realistic view of banks&apos; risk-adjusted returns,<lb/> mitigating incentives for excessive risk taking. Another advantage of the system is that it can be rule-<lb/>based, which avoids the difficult choice of the timing of activation. It is, however, difficult to calibrate as<lb/> history can be a poor guide for future losses. In Spain, it has enhanced the resilience of banks during the<lb/> downturn, even though it was not enough to cover all losses (<ref type="biblio">Saurina, 2009</ref>). But it has been unable to<lb/> prevent a huge housing boom.<lb/> As shown earlier, foreign-currency loans experienced high default rates in some Central and Eastern<lb/> Europe countries following currency depreciations. While foreign-currency loans avoid a currency<lb/> mismatch for banks financing themselves in foreign currency, the credit risk is increased by the<lb/> vulnerability of the borrower to large currency depreciations. Moreover, a low interest rate in a foreign<lb/> currency may bias perceptions of affordability. Hence, there is a strong case for applying tighter prudential<lb/> standards for foreign-currency loans. Brzoza-<ref type="biblio">Brzezina et al. (2014)</ref> show that, under plausible<lb/> assumptions, regulations restricting foreign currency lending enhance welfare, even though they may have<lb/> a short-term negative impact on economic activity.<lb/> Macro-prudential policy can also mitigate liquidity risk, by directly imposing liquidity requirements,<lb/> or by using other instruments to restrain credit growth when liquidity risks appear to threaten financial<lb/> stability. Housing booms have often been financed by inflows of foreign capital, which tend to be volatile.<lb/> A strong correlation between increases in real housing prices and changes in the current account deficit<lb/> was observed across a wide sample of advanced and emerging economies in the years preceding the GFC<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2009</ref>). Vulnerabilities associated with capital inflows may also arise in the absence<lb/> of current account imbalances, which only account for net flows while gross flows are also important in the<lb/> build-up of financial imbalances (<ref type="biblio">Borio and Disyatat, 2011; Ramskogler, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Implementing macro-prudential policies raises a number of additional challenges. Some instruments,<lb/> like dynamic provisioning, once put in place act as automatic stabilisers. However, most instruments will<lb/> require timely adjustments reflecting the evolution of risks. The complexity and innovation capacity of the<lb/> financial system make the setting of rules for intervention particularly challenging. Hence, policymakers<lb/> have to rely mostly on discretionary measures. This raises a number of questions. The first is about<lb/> institutional settings. In many countries, the central bank has the primary responsibility for macro-<lb/>prudential policy, but other countries have chosen other arrangements. For example, in Sweden the main<lb/> responsibility lies with the Financial Supervisory Authority. The discussion of the merits of different<lb/> institutional settings, which are largely country specific, is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, it<lb/> is important to stress that, as macro-prudential policy interacts with micro-prudential, monetary and<lb/> macroeconomic policies, coordination between the institutions involved is essential.<lb/> A second issue is about the trigger for implementing macro-prudential measures. Financial<lb/> imbalances are difficult to evaluate in real time. Looking specifically at housing booms, which are often<lb/> associated with rapid increases in household debt, identifying unsustainable developments is not<lb/> straightforward. Prior to the latest cycle, only about 60% of large real housing price upswings in a sample<lb/> of 18 OECD countries since 1970 ended in a bust (<ref type="biblio">Girouard et al., 2006</ref>). Recently, housing prices<lb/> stabilised at a high level in many countries. Housing price-to-rent and price-to-income ratios are useful<lb/> indicators of potential overvaluation, but even though they tend to revert to their long-term average over<lb/> the long run, they are generally non-stationary, even when allowing for long memory processes (<ref type="biblio">André et<lb/> al., 2014</ref>). These ratios are affected by interest rates and structural features of housing markets, like<lb/> urbanisation trends, supply responsiveness and taxation. Construction booms point to high risks, as very<lb/> few are followed by a soft landing (<ref type="biblio">Hoeller and Rae, 2007</ref>). Furthermore, as already mentioned, collapses<lb/> in construction are often associated with high losses for banks. Thus, episodes where housing prices and<lb/> construction both rise rapidly warrant particular vigilance. The literature also points to the association of<lb/> high credit growth, abundant liquidity and fast increases in property prices as an early warning for financial<lb/> crises (<ref type="biblio">Alessi and Detken, 2009</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Borio and Drehmann, 2009; ESRB, 2014; Dreger and Kholodilin, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Beyond uncertainty, political economy considerations may hamper the implementation of macro-prudential<lb/> policies, which have costs for the economy – e.g. lowering output growth and employment – or specific<lb/> groups – e.g. first-time buyers, banks or homebuilders. Finally, macro-prudential policies should operate in<lb/> a symmetric way, i.e. be loosened when risks are receding (ESRB, 2014).<lb/> A third issue is the risk of circumvention of macro-prudential measures. The risk of circumvention<lb/> through cross-border banking and other forms of external financing is a particular concern in advanced and<lb/> open economies (<ref type="biblio">Cerutti et al., 2015</ref>). Targeted macro-prudential measures, such as LTV and DTI caps are<lb/> more effective to rein in household debt than broader measures, such as capital requirements. However,<lb/> they may be easier to circumvent. Developments in shadow banking and cross-border lending in response<lb/> to tighter banking regulations should be monitored carefully (OECD, 2015). 17 The regulatory perimeter<lb/> should encompass all institutions susceptible of generating systemic risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monetary policy<lb/></head>

			<p>Before the GFC, there was a broad consensus that monetary policy should focus exclusively on<lb/> inflation at a horizon of around two years and possibly output or employment stabilisation depending on<lb/> the specific mandate of the central banks (<ref type="biblio">Galati and Moessner, 2011</ref>). 18 Views have evolved somewhat<lb/> since the GFC (<ref type="biblio">Yellen, 2009</ref>). Nevertheless, it remains that monetary policy is a blunt tool to deal with<lb/> rapid rises in housing prices and household debt. There may be a case for tightening monetary policy –<lb/> more than was done in recent years – when large increases in housing prices coincide with a solid<lb/> economic expansion. Even then, monetary policy may not be the right tool to avoid housing bubbles. The<lb/> interest rate hikes needed to stop a housing boom may be too big to be implemented without an excessively<lb/> large impact on output, employment and inflation. In addition, housing bubbles often take place in a<lb/> limited part of a country or monetary area. For example, before the GFC, such bubbles in the United States<lb/> were located mainly in Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada. Similarly, developments varied across<lb/> euro area countries, with housing bubbles in Ireland and Spain and flat or even declining housing prices in<lb/> 17 Monitoring of the shadow banking sector is being undertaken by the Financial Stability Board (e.g. FSB, 2015).<lb/> 18 This view was, however, challenged by some economists (<ref type="biblio">Cecchetti et al., 2002; Roubini, 2006; White, 2006</ref>) and<lb/> some central banks explicitly took into account housing price developments in their decisions at some point (e.g. the<lb/> Reserve Bank of Australia and Sweden&apos;s Riksbank).<lb/> Germany. Using monetary policy to moderate housing price increases in this context is bound to be quite<lb/> ineffective and to entail substantial costs in terms of economic activity.<lb/> At the current juncture, a number of countries are experiencing high and rising housing prices and<lb/> household debt as well as sluggish output growth and deflation risks. In this situation, the use of monetary<lb/> policy to rein in household debt would be in contradiction with its core objectives. It would weaken the<lb/> economy and entail risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. Hence, the monetary and financial<lb/> authorities have to rely mostly on macro-prudential measures to keep household debt in check, although<lb/> tax and housing market reforms could also help in some cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>When economies move back towards a steady growth path, with inflation close to target,<lb/> extraordinary monetary policy measures (e.g. quantitative easing) undertaken in response to the crisis will<lb/> need to be pared back. Nevertheless, there will be a continued need to assess monetary policy measures<lb/> within a policy mix to ensure household debt sustainability. For this, a number of factors have to be taken<lb/> into account, including the level of systemic risk, the cost of crises associated with high leverage and the<lb/> effectiveness of more targeted instruments, notably macro-prudential. Countries where housing price<lb/> spillovers to the wider economy are strongest should consider resolute action, including macro-prudential,<lb/> monetary, fiscal and structural measures, to avoid unsustainable construction and/or consumption<lb/> expansions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Housing policies<lb/></head>

			<p>An extensive discussion of structural housing policies is beyond the scope of this paper. 19 However, it<lb/> is essential to recognise that structural features of housing markets and policies may greatly complicate the<lb/> task of monetary and financial authorities in stabilising the housing market and ensuring the sustainability<lb/> of household debt. Hence, improved housing policies can yield a double dividend, as they increase well-<lb/>being and economic efficiency, while contributing to financial stability. Over recent decades, policies have<lb/> often pushed up demand, for example through favourable taxation of housing, housing allowances or<lb/> encouraging the supply of mortgages, especially to low-income households who could not always afford<lb/> them. At the same time, in many countries, urbanisation, tight land-use planning regulations and lack of<lb/> investment in infrastructure have blunted the supply response. In addition, rental regulations have<lb/> hampered the development of the private rental market in some countries (De <ref type="biblio">Boer and Bitetti, 2014</ref>). The<lb/> supply of affordable or social housing is in some places insufficient to ensure access to housing for the less<lb/> affluent part of the population. The GFC has worsened supply-demand imbalances for affordable housing,<lb/> as stagnation or falls in income and higher unemployment have increased demand for affordable and social<lb/> housing, while public supply has been hurt by tighter budget constraints and private construction has<lb/> suffered from uncertainty and tighter financing constraints (<ref type="biblio">Rosenfeld, 2015; Salvi del Pero et al., 2016</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Household debt may entail risks for households, the financial system and the wider economy. Hence,<lb/> it needs to be watched closely. However a high level of debt is not a sufficient indicator of risk. A more<lb/> disaggregated examination of the distribution of liabilities and assets across households is needed to assess<lb/> risks to financial stability and the macroeconomy. Financing structures for mortgages also need to be<lb/> monitored carefully, as maturity and currency mismatches can entail big risks for financial institutions. In a<lb/> number of countries, loose underwriting standards for mortgages were directly at the origin of financial<lb/> distress, but in many others the sources of vulnerability were more systemic. This suggests that sound<lb/> micro-prudential policies, although imperative from both a financial stability and consumer protection<lb/> perspective, are not enough to contain financial risks. At the current juncture, accommodative monetary<lb/> policy is needed in most OECD countries to support the economy and bring inflation back to target.<lb/> Exceptionally low interest rates may encourage the build-up of excessive household debt and create<lb/> housing price bubbles. Macro-prudential policy should mitigate this risk, but this remains a challenge, as<lb/> experience in implementing macro-prudential measures is limited and the development of the macro-<lb/>prudential framework is still work in progress. Unsustainable developments in household debt are not only<lb/> a potential threat to financial stability, they also have an impact on the macroeconomy, notably through<lb/> private consumption and construction activity, which strengthens the case for preventive action. Finally, a<lb/> number of OECD housing markets suffer from structural weaknesses, which makes stabilisation of<lb/> household debt more complicated. While financial policy measures are the primary tools to control<lb/> household debt in the short term, ensuring stability over the longer term, as well as meeting housing needs,<lb/> requires a holistic approach to housing market issues.</p>
