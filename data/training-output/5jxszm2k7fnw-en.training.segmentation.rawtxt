new jobs. The government has a substantial reform program to make it easier to do business in Spain, 
which should in some cases be deepened. Boosting economic growth requires a new generation of high-
growth companies and that resources flow towards the most productive firms. For this to happen, barriers 
to business growth have to be reduced by streamlining regulations and licencing procedures, 
internationalisation needs to be fostered, and competition strengthened. In addition, the negative impact of 
the crisis on companies, notably the high level of indebtedness and difficulties to obtain financing faced by 
some firms has to be relieved. This would be facilitated by more efficient insolvency procedures and 
further development of non-bank financing. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of Spain 
(http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-spain.htm). JEL classification: D21, D40, F10, K20, G21, G24, G33, H25, L11, L12, L25, L50

revêtent un rôle essentiel pour soutenir la croissance et la création d'emplois. Un important programme de 
réformes a été mis en oeuvre afin de faciliter l'activité d'entreprise en Espagne, dont certains aspects 
devraient être approfondis. Pour stimuler la croissance économique, il faut que voit le jour une nouvelle 
génération d'entreprises à forte croissance et que des ressources soient acheminées vers les entreprises les 
plus productives. Dans cette optique, les obstacles à la croissance des entreprises doivent être réduits en 
simplifiant les réglementations et les procédures d'agrément, l'internationalisation doit être encouragée et 
la concurrence doit être renforcée. En outre, les effets négatifs de la crise sur les entreprises, notamment le 
niveau élevé d'endettement et les difficultés rencontrées pour obtenir des financements, doivent être 
atténués, ce qui exige des procédures d'insolvabilité plus efficaces et un développement plus marqué des 
financements non bancaires. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l'Étude économique de l'OCDE de l'Espagne, 2014

absorb people and capital that have become idle during the crisis. Boosting economic growth requires a 
new generation of high-growth companies to invest in more productive activities where labour could be 
reallocated. Resources should flow to the most productive firms at the expense of the least productive ones, 
which had not been the case in the years prior to the crisis. Lifting the performance of the Spanish business 
sector requires meeting three inter-related challenges: reducing barriers to firm start-up and growth; 
increasing exporting and innovation; and boosting competition. Additional constraints created by the crisis 
should also be removed by rehabilitating highly indebted viable firms and facilitating the exit of the non-
viable ones, while improving access to credit and capital. The government reform programme already 
underway in these areas should be deepened along these lines. Key challenges affecting the Spanish business sector Resources need to be reallocated to the most productive firms An extensive literature has highlighted the important role of reallocation of resources across firms, 
even within narrowly defined sectors, for overall productivity growth (Arnold et al., 2008; Foster et al., 
2002; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Firm-level evidence suggests that Spain has lacked flexibility to 
re-allocate resources to more dynamic and productive firms (Figure 1). In Spain, firms with low 
productivity had stronger employment growth than others before the crisis. This contrasts with United 
Kingdom, Italy and France that show a strong positive association between productivity and employment 
growth. Productivity differentials between Spain and other high-income OECD economies cannot be fully 
explained by the shift of resources towards the construction sector in the boom years (Mora-Sanguinetti 
and Fuentes, 2012), but result from a lack of flexibility preventing resources from being efficiently 
reallocated (Crespo Rodríguez et al., 2012). 1.

Or latest data available. Source: OECD (2013), OECD Economic Surveys: Brazil 2013. How to read this figure: The bars represent quartiles of firms within an industry ordered by productivity levels relative to the industry 
average. The height of the bars measures annual employment growth, relative to the average of the country and sector. A bar higher 
than zero means that employment growth in a set of firms was above average. Implementing reforms that raise the productivity of existing firms, while at the same time fostering 
the flexibility needed for resource reallocation, will be one of the principal policy challenges for ensuring 
strong growth in the future. An environment that promotes reallocation and entrepreneurial risk-taking can 
also encourage innovative activity and investment in knowledge-based capital, which are associated with 
productivity improvements (OECD, 2013a; Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013). Structural policies can 
influence the ease with which such re-allocations occur (Andrews and Cingano, 2012). For example, 
administrative burdens can hamper firm entry, thresholds built into tax or labour codes can create 
disincentives for firms to grow beyond a certain size and credit markets may unduly favour incumbents at a 
time of crisis. Barriers to firm start-up and growth are too high Regulatory barriers to firm start-up, growth and exit discussed below have resulted in a business 
sector with many low productivity micro enterprises and too few medium and larger firms (Figures 2 
and 2.3). These features can be observed both in the manufacturing and services sectors and have remained 
unchanged over time. This dual distribution has serious implications for aggregate job growth, productivity 
and employment quality because, as elsewhere, larger firms have higher productivity. Spain, together with 
Italy, has more firms per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) than any other major European economy 
(OECD, 2013b), signalling that the business sector is fragmented. Spanish dual firm distribution is more 
similar to the one observed in developing countries, where many low-productivity locally focused micro 
firms coexist with a few large export-oriented multinationals, than with the one observed in other advanced 
economies. -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 1st

Firm size classes based on the number of persons employed. Source: OECD (2013), Entrepreneurship at a Glance 2013. Barriers to start-ups have also resulted in low birth rates of firms and particularly of young high 
growth firms (Figure 4). Spain also has one of the lowest early stage entrepreneurship rates, a measure of 
start-up activity (Figure 5). This is a crucial impediment to aggregate economic performance and job 
creation. New enterprises yield a competitive pressure on incumbent companies, improving resource 
allocation by forcing inefficient firms out of the market. New start-ups also exploit knowledge unused or 
under-used by existing companies, drawing on knowledge spillovers to enter new and established markets 
(Acs et al., 2009). High start-up rates are strongly associated with high economic growth and job creation 
(Acs et al., 2006; Stangler and Litan, 2009). Net job-creation tends to be concentrated in few fast–growing 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 ITA FRA ESP EU GBR DEU A.

Defined as the prevalence rate of individuals in the working age population who are actively involved in business start-ups, 
either in the phase in advance of the birth of the firm (nascent entrepreneurs), or the phase spanning 42 months after the birth 
of the firm (owner-managers of new firms). The payment of any wages for more than three months is considered the  " birth 
event "  of the firm. Individuals who are actively committing resources to start a business (that they expect to own or co-own) 
but for whom the business has not yet yielded wages or salaries are considered nascent entrepreneurs. Source: GEM (2014),  " Key Indicators " , Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Database, Global Entrepreneurship Research Association, 
London Business School, May Empirical evidence confirms this. Spanish young firms have a significantly higher contribution to 
employment creation than older businesses. Indeed, the more favourable job-creation behaviour of young 
firms with respect to mature firms is relatively more marked in Spain than in other economies (Criscoulo 
et al., 2014). Over 50% of new jobs in Spain between 2001 and 2011 were due to young firms, though such 
firms accounted for only about 20% of total employment. Start-ups tend to be smaller in Spain than in 
other countries, and they do not appear to grow much over time, both in manufacturing and services 
(Figure 6). This suggests that the high proportion of small firms and the low presence of larger businesses 
in Spain might be reflecting two different features: start-ups are often small and there is a large share of 
more mature businesses that do not grow. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 ITA

OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers, No. 14. Spain displays relatively high rates of self-employment (Figure 7). On the positive side, this can be a 
signal of entrepreneurism. However, it can also be a sign that employers prefer to hire workers as 
independent contractors to benefit from lower social security contributions, which could increase the 
duality of the labour market and reduce labour skills. It could also indicate that the economy is not creating 
enough opportunities in the formal labour market. Indeed, a higher incidence of self-employment tends to 
be related to the size of the informal economy, which in Spain is estimated to be around 22% of GDP 
(Schneider et al., 2010), above the OECD average. On the one hand, the fall in construction activity, which 
tends to have a high incidence of informality, would have contributed to reduced informality. On the other 
hand, the recession reduced business and job opportunities in the formal economy and may have increased 
incentives for entrepreneurs and workers to move to the informal economy. Informality may be a source of 
jobs and livelihood in the short-term, but it hampers growth, job quality and productivity in the medium-
term. Informal enterprises have an incentive not to grow to escape from tax authorities and there is a 
positive relationship between the size of the informal economy and the size of the micro-enterprise sector 
(OECD, 2013b). Informal firms also tend not to invest in modernising production. This translates into low 
productivity per worker and hence low wages. Moreover, the informal sector does not proportionally 
contribute to the financing of public services and infrastructure and acts as unfair competition to compliant 
firms. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 USA LUX

Internationalisation and innovation are low Along with the collapse of the construction sector (and to a lesser extent the downsizing of the 
financial sector), the recovery of cost-competitiveness has allowed Spain to initiate a re-orientation of its 
productive system towards exporting sectors. The weight of exports in GDP has considerably increased, 
although it remains far below the euro area (Figure 8). It is essential that the Spanish business sector's 
efforts to internationalise its activities continue and extend. Figure 8. Evolution of exports Exports in volume, per cent of GDP Source: OECD (2014), OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database), July. Increasing further internationalisation would render positive effects on multiple fronts, since the 
performance of manufacturing exporting firms is significantly better than that of non-exporting firms 
(Table 2.1). They are substantially larger, have higher real productivity and physical capital stock per 
employee, rely more on skilled labour and are more likely to invest in research and development (R&D) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 NOR

firms also tend to export more. It is also crucial for boosting business sector productivity in the medium-
run. Business R&D was 0.7% of GDP in 2010, far below OECD (1.6%) and European Union (EU, 1.2%) 
averages. Around 50% of R&D is undertaken by large firms. This is one of the lowest percentages in the 
OECD and it couples with one of the most generous R&D tax credit schemes. The proportion of small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that innovate is also well below OECD average (Figure 9). Few SMEs 
undertake new marketing, organisational methods or make product or process innovations. Around 80% of 
large companies do some kind of innovation, but this is again below rates observed in most OECD 
innovative countries. The government should deepen its efforts to expand the innovation system and 
encourage greater spillovers to the business sector (Haugh and Westmore, 2014). ECO/WKP(2014)69 14 Figure 9. Innovation types by firm size Per cent of total firms in same category, 2008-10 1 1.

Competition and cost-competitiveness need boosting Increasing competition across the Spanish economy, and particularly in network and professional 
services sectors that all firms rely on, is crucial for cost-competitiveness. Spain has undertaken several 
recent reforms to foster competition in goods and services markets. Prior to the recession profit margins 
grew faster than in other euro area countries. Profit margins have moderated since the recession but remain 
higher than in other euro area countries (Table 2.2). High margins reflect the need for firms to rebuild their 
finances in the context of tight credit conditions, but it also signals weaknesses in effective competition in 
some markets (Montero and Urtasun, 2014; Banco de España, 2014). As the recovery strengthens and 
external financing becomes available at lower cost, it is essential to continue to foster competition in goods 
and services markets to consolidate and reinforce competitiveness gains and to maximise the impact of 
other reforms, such as those in the labour market, on job creation. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 CHL

Research, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria. How to read this table: The contributions to growth indicate how much of the changes in the GDP deflator are due to changes in 
wages, productivity, profit margins and taxes. Increases in wages, profit margins and taxes contribute to higher price increases, while 
higher productivity helps to reduce prices. For example, in the period 1999-2008 the GDP deflator increased by 3.7 percentage points 
in Spain. Most of the increase was due to increases in wages and profit margins. A small part of the increase was due to increases in 
taxes, while productivity had no impact. Debt remains high and financing conditions are tight The Spanish business sector is weighed down by a large share of highly indebted firms by 
international standards. At least one third of listed firms have a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of over four (Figure 10). There are substantial differences across 
sectors and also depending on firm size (Figure 11). The level of indebtedness, defined as debt over total 
net assets, for small and medium-sized companies is significantly lower than for large companies (although 
it should be noted that the coverage of small firms in the sample is very reduced). In the large corporate 
sector the strongest deleveraging has taken place in information and technology companies, while large 
construction firm's indebtedness kept increasing until 2011, following valuation corrections that translated 
into lower asset values. Large companies in all sectors considered have debt-to-assets ratios above 45%, 
while the ratio is above 35% for medium-sized firms. ECO/WKP(2014)69 16 Figure 10. Debt-to-earnings ratio of firms Per cent of firms with various debt-to-earnings ratios 1 1.

invest and hire and if they ultimately prove unviable are using capital that could be reallocated to better 
performing firms. The government has made significant efforts to improve the debt restructuring and 
insolvency framework to help rehabilitate these firms and close down unviable ones. However, further 
efforts are required to quickly unburden the business sector, and by doing so indirectly the banking sector, 
otherwise the recovery is likely to remain very slow. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 United Kingdom

predominately used by SMEs (Figure 12). SMEs are particularly vulnerable to banking sector stress (Ryan 
et al., 2014), as they have more difficulties in establishing new banking relationships and they tend to use 
real-estate assets as collateral. In addition, alternatives to non-bank financing have been so far very limited. Figure 12. Credit conditions Interest rates on loans to non-financial corporations, per cent 1 1.

Improving the regulatory framework to favour business dynamism and growth Favouring business start-ups Fostering a dynamic and high performing business sector is complex and requires a broad 
combination of policies. Particularly important is the interaction between product and labour market 
policies. In Spain labour market policies that have resulted in dualism and precarious employment (Haugh 
and Westmore, 2014) are reinforced by product, service and financial market regulation that have favoured 
incumbents and left capital in unviable firms for too long. Broad reform of product, tax, insolvency and 
financial market policies is required to reduce barriers to firm entry and to spur reallocation of resources 
towards a new cohort of more productive, innovative, export intensive and quality-job rich enterprises. Spain has been making good progress in improving measured product market regulations and 
converging towards best practices in the areas of state control and barriers to trade and investment. 
However, progress has been more muted in reducing barriers to entrepreneurship (Figure 13, Panel A). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2008

Spain has the second highest barriers to entrepreneurship in the OECD (OECD, 2013c). Spain also ranks 
142nd (out of 185) with respect to ease to start a business (World Bank and IFC, 2014). The regulatory 
procedures have been too complex so far, especially the licences and permits system. Obtaining licences 
and permits is more difficult in Spain than in most OECD countries (Figure 13, Panel B). Contrary to best 
practices there are no standard procedures to use the  " silence is consent "  rule for issuing the licences 
required to open up a business. And there are not yet single contact points for issuing or accepting all 
notifications and licenses that are required to open up a private limited company. With the aim of 
addressing this, the entrepreneurship law (law 14/2013) foresees the creation of the so-called 
 " Entrepreneur support points "  (Puntos de Atención al Emprendedor) network. Crucially, firms have not been operating in a single market in Spain but rather have had to face the 
inconveniences of a regulatory framework, which is regionally and locally fragmented. A firm wishing to 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 1998

Regulatory protection of incumbents B. Barriers to entrepreneurship, 2013 ECO/WKP(2014)69 19 operate in multiple regions of Spain has been in many cases required to obtain a separate licence or permit 
for their activity from the different regions where they wish to conduct business. In addition, often 
requirements have differed, forcing higher costs on firms who have to adapt products to local requirements 
(for example in labelling). To tackle this and move towards a truly single market the government has introduced the Market 
Unity Law. This law is a flagship reform and, if fully implemented, has the potential to revolutionise doing 
business in Spain. It aims at simplifying business licensing requirements, by increasing the use of 
notification procedures (with ex post controls) and reducing the need for prior authorisations to exert 
economic activities. It also aims at ensuring that permits issued in one region will automatically be valid 
for the others. Thus, it has the potential to improve substantially the regulatory framework, foster 
competition and eliminate barriers preventing firms from taking advantage of economies of scale. The law 
is inspired by the EU Services Directive, but it is broader in scope. It provides for principles of free 
establishment and movement of goods and services in Spain and for their application in practice. According to the law, all legal texts enacted at local, regional and central government level that may 
be considered inconsistent with the market unity will have to be amended in the following six months. So 
far 2 700 regulatory barriers, most at the regional level, have been identified as inconsistent with the 
market unity. This process is to be supported by enhancing administrative cooperation, and by setting up a 
procedure for responding quickly to complaints about obstacles to the single market. Spain's Competition 
Authority has been granted power to file administrative appeals with regard to situations contrary to the 
law. Legislative amendments will be discussed by regional and central government representatives in 
sectoral conferences. The law also entails measurement and monitoring procedures, which should help to 
assess implementation progress. These procedures include the elaboration of a directory of good and bad 
practices and the publication of regulatory quality indicators. A swift implementation of the law, while 
challenging both technically, due to the complexity of dealing with a large body of regulation, and 
politically, due to resistance by some regions, will be crucial to boost the performance of the Spanish 
business sector. Effective coordination and cooperation among the different levels of government will be 
critical, in particular when it comes to amending sector specific legislation. Besides the law on market unity, another on-going initiative to improve business climate is Emprende 
en tres, an electronic one-stop-shop designed to present declarations of responsibility required for 
entrepreneurs to start up a new economic activity, and a reduced tax rate for new corporate starts-up 
introduced in 2013. The rate is 15% for new companies. Spain also foresees conducting annual reviews of 
the business regulatory framework to detect and remove obstacles hampering entrepreneurship, investment 
and business activities. This initiative is conducted by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with 
the collaboration of ICEX (Spanish Export Agency) and Invest in Spain (the Spanish body in charge of 
public relations with foreign investors). First meetings with representatives of several industrial and 
services sectors, academics and research services are already taking place. In addition, the World Bank will 
undertake a subnational Doing Business study in Spain during 2014 and 2015, with the aim of identifying 
regulatory best practices among Spanish regions and spurring regulatory improvement. The law on Environmental Assessment 21/2013 also advocates for further standardising the 
legislation across Spain in the area of environmental assessment procedures, seeking greater collaboration 
and harmonisation across regions. Favouring firms' growth Spanish business framework conditions include multiple size-dependent regulations, originally aimed 
at supporting SMEs. One of them is the corporate tax that has special clauses depending on firm sizes both 
in terms of turnover and number of employees. The standard corporate tax rate is 30%. The corporate rate ECO/WKP(2014)69 20 for SMEs – defined for the tax as firms with an annual turnover below EUR 10 million – is 25% on profits 
up to EUR 300 000 and 30% above that. The rate is further reduced to 20% for SMEs with net revenues 
below EUR 5 million and fewer than 25 employees who have not decreased the number of workers they 
employ. Despite all these preferential rates for SMEs, larger firms are capable of optimising existing 
deductions, resulting in differences between statutory rates and effective rates that widen as turnover 
increases. The current configuration of the tax also implies differences in effective rates within the SME 
segment depending on the number of employees that the firms employ (Figure 14). The effective rate is 
highest for medium-sized enterprises having between 100 and 250 employees. This creates incentives for 
firms to remain small ( " lock-in "  effect), which has serious implications for aggregate productivity given 
the higher productivity that generally prevails in larger enterprises. All this indicates that the tax is not 
successful in supporting SMEs and may be penalising medium-size firms and biasing firm's distributions 
towards smallest sizes, to the detriment of medium-sized. Reducing tax deductions would decrease the 
capacity of larger firms to avoid taxation. Using that fiscal space to establish a unique and lower corporate 
tax rate for all firms would provide better incentives for firm's growth and would also align corporate 
taxation with the OECD average (25.3% in 2013, Figure 15), which would contribute to attracting 
investment. In this sense, the government announced in June 2014 a draft tax reform, which proposes 
broadening the base, reducing tax credits, reducing the standard tax rate to 25% by 2016 and suppressing 
the preferential rate for SMEs. The reduced rate for starts-up, introduced in 2013, is maintained. Figure 14. Effective corporate tax rates by firm size Per cent, 2011 1 1.

Rates typically applying for or targeted at small (incorporated) business, where such targeting is on the basis of size alone 
(e.g. number of employees, amount of assets, turnover or taxable income) and not on the basis of expenditures or other 
targeting criteria. Source: OECD (2014), OECD Tax Database, www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm. Other size-dependant fiscal regulations, such as different levels of tax enforcement, also affect the 
size distribution (Almunia and López, 2013). Firms with more than EUR 6 million in reported revenue are 
monitored by the large taxpayers' unit, which involves more frequent tax audits and more information 
requirements. The effect of this kind of threshold on firm behaviour is strong. There is excess mass of 
firms, or  " bunches " , just below the revenue threshold and there is evidence that firms have deliberately 
reduced reported revenue by up to 7.5% to avoid falling in the high enforcement regime. There is also 
evidence that firms locating below the threshold misreport their material and labour input costs to evade 
taxes. There are also size-contingent regulations in the labour market that start to bind at different firm sizes. 
They relate to different workers representation obligations, the availability of special employment contracts 
(e.g. Contrato de emprendedores), social security contributions deductions and flexibility to change or 
terminate employment contracts (Table 2.3). Risk prevention obligations also differ depending on the size 
of the company. Companies above 250 employees need to elaborate, negotiate and apply an equality plan. 
All these size-dependent regulations start biting at different sizes. This prevents a marked  " cliff "  effect as 
in France at 50 employees (Garicano et al., 2012) but it compounds a complex system difficult and costly 
to navigate. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 IRL

The  " plus "  sign indicates when more demanding regulatory requirements kick in. The  " minus "  sign indicates at which size 
special conditions, such as fiscal incentives, are no longer available. For example, regulations on workers representation start 
operating when firms have six employees; when they reach 9-10 employees there are additional requirements and yet more 
kick in if the firm reaches 30 employees. As concerns hiring regulations, there is a special contract modality (Contrato de 
emprendedores), offering an extended trial period of one year and several hiring incentives and fiscal rebates. That contract 
modality is only available for firms with less than 50 employees. Source: Confebask (2012),  " Diseño de una política pública de redimensionamiento empresarial en Euskadi "  (Designing a corporate 
resizing policy in the Basque Country), Informe final del grupo de trabajo de Confebask. Size-dependent policies should be carefully designed to avoid they become unintended barriers to 
firm growth. In general, the emphasis should be on ensuring that policies support the specific needs of 
SMEs (for example providing direct innovation support, as young SMEs may not have the profits to claim 
R&D tax credits), rather than progressively tightening regulatory requirements with size, as is currently the 
case in Spain. When designing support policies, their potential effect on firms' growth dynamics should be 
explicitly recognised and examined, with the aim of minimising distortions and potential  " lock-in "  effects. In general, business regulations de jure or de facto tend to be more detrimental for medium-sized 
companies than for large or small companies. It is easier to ignore regulations when businesses are small. 
Large companies have more legal and administrative resources that enable them to legally optimise and 
exploit existing regulations. Medium-size companies neither can ignore regulations nor have resources to 
deal efficiently with them. Increasing and deepening internationalisation Export performance has been mixed The Spanish external sector has led the recovery and export performance has been better in Spain than 
in other European economies (Figure 16). Both goods and services explain this performance. On the back 
of improving cost-competitiveness and the need to search for new markets given the weakness in domestic 
demand, goods exports have increased across most product categories. Additionally, services exports, 
notably tourism, have also grown steadily since 2008. To further lift exports Spain faces four main 
challenges: increasing the number of regular exporters; up-grading the technological content of exports; 
diversifying trading partners; and ensuring that the business environment is favourable for both goods and 
services exports. ECO/WKP(2014)69 23 Figure 16. Export performance Ratio of export volumes to export markets, index 2002 = 100 1 1. 
This measure includes both goods and services exports Source: OECD (2014), OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections (database), July. The export base has widened with an increasing number of firms becoming exporters (Figure 17, 
Panel A). Both the number of firms regularly exporting and the number of firms exporting above 
EUR 50 000 have remained constant though. Consequently exports are becoming increasingly 
concentrated in a few firms (Figure 17, Panel B): the top 25 exporters accounted for more than 25% of all 
exports in 2013; the top 100 exporters account for nearly 40% of exports. Figure 17. Number of exporting firms and export concentration 1. 
Regular exporters are those that have exported for the last four consecutive years; heavy exporters are those whose export 
value exceeds EUR 50 000 per year. Source: ICEX (2014),  " Perfil de la empresa exportadora española -enero-mayo 2014 " , España Exportación e Inversiones, Ministerio 
de Economía y Competitividad. Export performance is influenced not only by changes in price and non-price-competitiveness, but 
also by the composition of exports, whether in terms of geographical destination or of type of product. For

Per cent ECO/WKP(2014)69 24 strong, exports will increase even if competitiveness does not improve. A constant market share analysis 
(CMSA) can help to disentangle and measure these factors (González Pandiella, 2014).The basic idea 
underpinning this analysis is that changes in exports are due either to changes in individual market shares 
or to a specialisation in particularly dynamic markets or industries. A CMSA decomposes the difference 
between the growth of Spanish manufacturing exports and the growth of total exports of the rest of the 
world in two factors (Annex 2.A1). On one hand, the so-called market share effect captures the gain or loss 
in shares that would occur if the export structure, whether in geographical or sectoral terms, were to remain 
unchanged. It seeks to capture the extent to which changes in shares have been due to changes in price and 
non-price competitiveness. On the other hand, the structure effect quantifies the extent to which the 
country is benefiting from an advantageous position in terms of the composition of its exports. In turn, the 
structural effect can be divided into a product effect, a geographical effect and a mixed effect. The first two 
show the gain in share arising, respectively, from exporting products and from exporting towards regions 
where demand has been more dynamic. The mixed effect captures the interaction of both effects, given the 
impossibility of distinguishing perfectly between them. The CMSA signals that, in the more recent periods, changes in market shares have been the main 
driving force behind Spanish manufacturing export performance (Figure 18, Panel A). The negative total 
effect indicates that Spanish exports grew less than world exports from 2003 to 2011, except in 2007. The 
main contributor was the market share effect, indicating that the below-average growth of exports was due 
to losses of competitiveness. However, a cross-country comparison reveals that losses of market shares 
were less pronounced in Spain than in other European advanced economies (Figure 19, Panel A), including 
Germany. Gains in competitiveness started to pay off in 2012 when Spanish goods exports grew above 
world exports. Figure 18. Main results of a constant market share analysis Percentage points 1 1. 
Based on exports in US dollars, nominal values. The sector covered is manufacturing (excluding energy) plus agriculture, 
forestry and fishing. Source: Calculations based on OECD (2014), International Trade by Commodity Statistics (ITCS Database), May. How to read this figure: Total effect is the difference between the growth rates of Spanish exports and of world exports. The market 
effect aggregates the variation of shares in individual export markets. The combined structure effect can be decomposed into product 
and geographical structure effect plus a residual term (so-called mixed effect). Product and geographical effects are positive if a 
country has above average specialisation in markets that grow faster than overall world trade. Conversely, high specialisation in slow-
growing markets gives rise to negative structure effects. ECO/WKP(2014)69 25 Figure 19. Cross-country constant market share analysis results 1 Index 1995 = 100, cumulative results 1.

and market specialisation were more geared towards more dynamic segments. For example the 
contribution of the product structure to export performance has remained broadly unchanged over time 
(Figure 19, Panel B). By contrast, Germany's evolution of product specialisation has been more favourable 
to its export performance, reflecting a higher specialisation in products experiencing higher growth such as 
medium to high technology products. Italy, had a similar evolution in product structure as Spain until 2006, 
and has also recently improved the contribution of product specialisation to export performance by shifting 
its sectoral export structure towards more dynamic products. This highlights one of the main weaknesses of the Spanish external sector. Despite recent progress, 
the product structure has remained broadly unchanged in Spain during the last ten years (Figure 20). Low-
technology exports have increased slightly even though this is an export segment that has grown below 
average in world trade. The share of motor vehicles and components in total exports has fallen but this 
remains a key sector in Spanish exports. Other medium-high technology exports have slightly increased 
but they have done so below aggregate growth. Last, the share of high-technology exports has remained 
unchanged. 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 A. Market share effect Spain

Spain's mix of trading partners has not been conducive to better goods export performance either 
(Figure 19, Panel C). This reflects an over-specialisation in European markets that have grown below 
average, such as France, Italy and Portugal. Around 63% of exports are destined for the European Union. 
At the same time there is an under-specialisation in more dynamic markets, such as China and other Asian 
economies. Exports to markets such as China and other emerging economies have recently increased, but 
by less than world exports to those destinations. Internationalisation policy needs to take also strong account of the services sector. Services account 
for an increasing share of Spanish total exports and have significantly contributed to the rebalancing of the 
Spanish economy and the return of the current account balance to positive territory. Most services 
categories have grown since 2007, the exception is financial services. In terms of product composition, 
tourism and travel account for more than 40% of total exports (Figure 21, Panel A). Geographically, as in 
manufacturing goods, nearly 70% of export services are destined for the European Union (Figure 21, Panel 
B). As in goods, Spain faces the challenge of increasing penetration of its services exports into non-
European markets and widening its product specialisation beyond labour-intensive services. 10.3 25.7 19.5 15.6 21.7 2003 10.6 19.0 22.9 17.3 23.5 2013 High

Total value of services exports is EUR 109.3 billion. Source: Bank of Spain (2014), Bolétin Estadístico (database), July. Policies to improve export performance A broad mix of policies is needed to meet these challenges. To increase the number of regular 
exporters, Spain should take advantage of the group of Spanish multinationals with substantial 
international experience by establishing more formal mechanisms of collaboration between them and 
SMEs attempting to gain access to new markets. Moving towards a product structure with higher technology content requires stepping up business 
innovation activities. Innovation and export participation have been found to be heavily interlinked, both in 
Spain (Caldera, 2010) and internationally (Altomonte et al., 2013; Aw et al., 2011). Exporters often access 
diverse knowledge inputs not available in the domestic market (Salomon and Shaver, 2005). Product 
innovation is a very important driver of exports for Spanish firms, notably SMEs (Cassiman et al., 2010), 
suggesting that export promotion policies should be combined with policies focused on promoting product 
innovation. Thus, coordinating and integrating internationalisation and innovation policies under a single 
responsibility would likely be beneficial. It would allow effects of diverse policies to be internalised, avoid 
potential duplications and could increase synergies between various modes of innovation and 
internationalisation. In this sense, the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the Spanish Economy 
includes measures for a closer collaboration between the export promotion agency, ICEX, and the Centre 
for Technological and Industrial Development (CDTI). Efforts to improve business framework conditions are likely to have also a positive effect in attracting 
additional foreign direct investment (FDI). Encouraging greater FDI would help to boost the technological 
content of exports by bringing new technologies and processes to Spain. Indeed, economies such as Ireland 
have used foreign investment to establish entire new high technology industries such as medical devices 
and pharmaceuticals. Another of the measures of the Strategic Plan for the Internationalisation of the 
Spanish Economy is the establishment of a new programme to attract and facilitate direct foreign 
investment in the information and communication technology sector. Greater foreign investment would 
also provide more potential for linkages into global value chains for Spanish SMEs. FDI inflows into Spain 
have been falling since 2000 (Figure 22). Nevertheless, Spain has recently managed to attract and maintain 
a healthy pipeline of FDI in the automobile sector. FDI inflows increased in 2013, reflecting rising investor 
confidence and existing opportunities in some sectors under restructuring such as banking or construction. 42 25 16 5 4

Foreign direct investment inflows Balance of payments basis, per cent of GDP Source: OECD (2014),  " FDI series of BOP and IIP aggregates " , OECD International Direct Investment Statistics (database), July. The cost to export remains high in international perspective (Table 4), and this is likely penalising 
exports to more distant destinations especially by SMEs and inhibiting market diversification. Maritime 
transport activities show low productivity and reducing these and other trading costs associated with more 
distant markets should be a priority (discussed below). Table 4. Trading across borders For a standardised cargo of goods using sea transport, June 2013 1 Rank Export

investors, entrepreneurs, researchers and professionals, the setting up a new Global Window at ICEX, to 
provide information to SMEs on all available public support instruments, and renewed programmes to 
access new markets. Progress will be monitored through a set of indicators. Strengthening competition and boosting cost competitiveness Strengthening competition is also vital for sustaining and reinforcing the ongoing recovery of cost 
competitiveness needed to underpin further internationalisation of the economy. Countries with more 
competitive regulatory frameworks for services achieve higher added value, productivity and export 
growth in the manufacturing sectors that use services as inputs more intensively (Barone and Cingano, 
2011). The potential beneficial effects are particularly strong for Spain, which is one of the OECD 
countries whose manufacturing exports embody higher value added from services (OECD, 2013d). Indeed, 
for Spain the adoption of the best regulatory practices in services could increase real goods exports by 18% 
(Correa-López and Doménech, 2014). An important lever for boosting competition generally is to facilitate new firm entry and growth by 
allowing more flexibility in wage bargaining. New firms need to be able to offer different conditions from 
incumbents as a way of offsetting the often sizeable advantages of incumbency. Indeed, inflexible labour 
markets lead to less dynamic firm growth distributions (Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013). Stringent regulation 
increases the costs of downward adjustment and is likely to encourage a more conservative growth strategy 
(which in turns decreases the pressure on underperforming firms). Lower risk taking and slower job 
reallocation may in turn reduce productivity growth. Firms may be less willing to expand their workforce 
or enter into new markets if they cannot reduce their workforce later if their efforts prove to be 
unsuccessful. Recent changes in Spanish labour market regulations have provided a less stringent 
protection legislation regime that gives more scope for new firms to offer different wage and working 
conditions from incumbents. However, more can be done to decentralise wage-bargaining processes and 
thereby reduce the power of incumbent companies to use sectorial agreements as barriers to entry (Haugh 
and Westmore, 2014). Actions need also to be taken to increase competition in sectors that provide inputs used by nearly all 
firms. This is an important avenue for reducing non-labour costs and improving competitiveness of 
Spanish firms in international markets. Areas of key concern include electricity, professional services, 
ports and oil distribution because of their pervasive use by the business sector and/or importance for 
exporting. Increasing the efficiency of the judicial system would also help to lower costs for a large part of 
the business sector. Increasing competition in professional services Business services, in particular professional services which account for 75% of business services, are 
markedly less productive in Spain than in other European economies (Figure 23). This is coupled with 
entry requirements that are above the OECD average (Figure 24) and practices far from those in the best 
performing countries. The services trade restrictiveness index for Spain is also above the OECD average in 
business services, particularly legal and accounting services (OECD, 2014). In addition, there is an 
unusually large number of professions for which there is a requirement to be a member of the professional 
body. Opening up these services to competition would increase productivity, drive down prices, improve 
the quality of the services and provide more job opportunities. ECO/WKP(2014)69 30 Figure 23. Productivity in professional services Apparent labour productivity, gross value added in thousand euros per person employed, 2011 1 1.

SVK D. Engineering ECO/WKP(2014)69 32 professions for which membership to the professional body would be compulsory. However, the final 
reform seems to be less ambitious than originally planned on this front. It would be important that the 
original ambition and spirit of the law is maintained by ensuring that membership fees cannot act as 
barriers to entry to the professions. The reform could also potentially increase the mobility and competition 
among providers of professional services throughout Spain and therefore can be framed within the effort 
being undertaken via the market unity law to create a truly unified domestic market. Once the law is 
approved, the consistency of sector specific legislation, including regional legislation and professional 
organisations' internal rules, with the new regulatory framework will also need to be swiftly ensured so 
that the liberalisation is fully effective. Fostering competition in network industries Spain has made good progress in liberalising network industries. At the same time some sectors, such 
as electricity and gas, are dominated by large vertically integrated companies. The electricity sector has 
recently been at the centre of intense debate because of reforms to eliminate the so-called electricity tariff 
deficit (see Assessment and Recommendations). Electricity prices are high in international comparison, 
especially for SMEs (Figure 25). The new electricity price mechanism has the potential to incentivise more 
effective price competition between different electricity providers. Nevertheless possible uncompetitive 
price setting practices have already been identified by the competition authority (CNMC, 2014a), which 
has claimed in multiple instances that the degree of competition in the wholesale market is insufficient 
(CNC, 2013a). The market is dominated by two firms (Endesa and Iberdrola) which are involved in all 
areas of activity and manage more than 70% of electricity demand via commercialisers and distributors. 
The existing separation between distribution and commercialisation activities has been deemed insufficient 
by the competition authority, despite existing requirements for legal and accounting separations. 
Competition in the electricity sector could be strengthened by reinforcing the separation between 
distribution and commercialisation, and also between distribution and other related activities such as the 
installation of measurement equipment, where distributors can take advantage of their incumbent position 
and information. Competition would be further boosted by ensuring a more level playing field between 
incumbents and potential entrants, such as independent commercialisers, and by reducing the cost 
associated to entering these activities. Figure 25. Electricity prices for industrial consumers Prices excluding value added tax, euro per kilowatt/hour, 2013 1 1.

fundamental. In international perspective, there seems to be room to widen the scope of actions that the 
regulator can undertake in electricity and gas areas (Figure 26). In particular, it would be beneficial that the 
regulator reviews and approves contract terms between regulated entities or market actors, and issues 
industry standards, guidelines and codes of conduct, as done in other OECD countries. Figure 26. Scope of action by regulators Indicator of regulatory management, index scale of 0-6 from widest to lowest scope, 2013 1 1.

countries where no bar appears. Source: OECD (2013), Product Market Regulation Database, www.oecd.org/economy/pmr. Low cross-border transmission capacity with France has also contributed to inefficiencies and higher 
costs in the Spanish electricity sector. It prevents Spain from engaging in cross-border trade in electricity 
and gas, and from profiting from its overcapacity in electricity generation: only around 44 gigawatts are 
used at peak demand compared with 100 gigawatts installed. A new electricity interconnection with France 
was supposed to be operational in 2014 but its entry into service has been further postponed. More 
effective interconnections with Portugal and France would foster competition between electricity and gas 
companies, increase the liquidity of both markets, allow diversity of supply and provide a more 
competitive environment. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 GBR

PRT D. Ports ECO/WKP(2014)69 34 Boosting competition in ports Boosting competition in ports and lowering costs for exporters is key to boosting cost-competiveness 
of Spanish firms and fostering internationalisation. The port regulator is not an independent body, contrary 
to international best practices and to practices followed in other regulated sectors in Spain. Instead the 
regulator is a ministerial department or agency, whose decisions can be overturned by governmental or 
ministerial bodies. The port system in Spain is composed of 28 port authorities, which have ample 
autonomy and depend largely on regional authorities. Sea and coastal freight water transport activities have low productivity (Figure 27), despite Spain 
having several ports that are large by European standards (e.g. Barcelona, Algeciras or Valencia), 
suggesting the possibility of significant economies of scale. One direct and damaging implication is that 
the cost to trade is significantly higher in Spain than in other OECD countries (discussed above). In some 
instances anticompetitive policies and undue barriers to entry have been identified (CNC, 2013b). Figure 27. Productivity in sea and coastal freight water transport Apparent labour productivity, gross value added in thousand euros per person employed, 2011 1 1. 
2010 for Greece, 2009 for Belgium and Turkey, 2008 for United Kingdom. Source: Eurostat (2014),  " Structural business Statistics – Services " , Eurostat Database, July. Transport costs tend to have a disproportionate effect on trade volumes (Clark et al., 2004). In 
general, it has been estimated that raising transport costs by 10% can reduce trade volumes by more than 
20% (Limao and Venables, 2000). While Spain's regulated port costs have been decreasing, stevedoring 
costs remain very high in international perspective, and these services typically account for the largest 
percentage of the total cost of moving goods through a port. Stevedoring activities are restricted to a pool 
of exclusive workers. Cargo-handling companies are not allowed to resort to the market to employ their 
staff. Instead, cargo-handling companies are required to participate financially in the capital of private 
companies, which in turn provide them with the required workforce. Only when the workforce proposed by 
these private companies is not suitable or not sufficient can the cargo-handling companies freely hire staff 
from the market. These restrictive labour practices discourage the entry of new cargo-handling providers, 
posing a barrier to attract new investment. This regime is having a significant impact in the productivity 
and competitiveness of Spanish ports and is hampering the Spanish export sector. According to the 
European Commission it violates the principle of free establishment of economic activity, although the 
issue has been brought to the court of justice of the EU. Access to stevedoring activities should be opened 
and adjusted to the EU legislation. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 HUN FRA TUR SVK GRC SVN SWE PRT POL ESP FIN

markets for many other sectors of the economy, whose international competitiveness is hampered. Recent 
trend in gross margins in the fuel distribution sector are characteristic of uncompetitive markets (CNMC, 
2014b). Consumers face high pre-tax fuel prices compared with international fuel prices and with pre-tax 
prices in other advanced European economies (Avedillo Carretero, 2013). The concentration in the 
automotive fuel sector remains too high and there is evidence of aligned pricing practices between the two 
main operators, REPSOL and CEPSA. There is also a high level of vertical integration between supply, 
refining and retail activities. Low-cost fuel retailers have a low market share and the competition between 
service stations located on major roads is low. In July 2013, the government simplified procedures for 
opening service stations and introduced some measures which reduce the power of established distributors 
against independent retailers. The number of openings of independent service stations has grown but 
increasing contestability in the distribution sector remains yet necessary. Simplifying the opening of 
service stations in supermarkets and hypermarkets and reducing the duration of long-term agreements 
giving exclusive operating rights over service stations have provided positive competition dynamics in the 
past in some regions, which should be further exploited. Improving judicial efficiency The judicial system is also an important source of costs for business and improving its efficiency is an 
important path for increasing cost-competitiveness and economic performance (Palumbo et al., 2013). 
More efficient judicial systems have a positive effect on the size of firms, both internationally (Kumar 
et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2006) and in Spain (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013a). It also has a 
positive effect on the entry rate of Spanish firms (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2014). The Spanish judicial system does not rank well internationally in terms of efficiency. Spain holds 
position 26 out of a total of 35 legal systems in its ability to resolve disputes before the first instance courts 
(Palumbo et al. 2013). Spain ranks 21st out of 31 OECD countries in terms of enforcing contracts (World 
Bank and IFC, 2014). Clearance rates are low, the case backlog remains high, and procedures are relatively 
lengthy (European Commission, 2013), despite some recent improvement (European Commission, 2014). The government has adopted measures to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system, including 
reorganising the courts, implementing electronic judicial files and promoting out-of-court solutions to 
conflicts. However, significant problems remain. A critical problem from the business perspective are the 
so-called recursos administrativos, which are appeals against the public administration, over for example a 
tax liability or denial of a permit, that need to be undertaken before reaching the ordinary judicial system. 
These administrative appeals are slow to make findings and rarely conclude on the merits of the case. They 
should be replaced by time limited administrative mediation processes that would automatically be deemed 
as in a firm's favour if the time limit is exceeded. In addition, despite significant investment in information and communication technologies, the new 
tools are not yet readily available in all courts. Promoting further mediation arrangements can provide 
faster and more efficient conflict resolutions. Increasing competition in the legal profession could also 
induce lower litigation and hence have a positive effect on the efficiency of the system. The pressure 
exercised by competition among lawyers would constrain their potential rents, thereby reducing the 
number of cases that the lawyers may find profitable to bring to court rather than settle (OECD, 2013e). ECO/WKP(2014)69 36 Tackling over-indebtedness and improving access to finance Facilitating insolvency procedures to help restore credit growth Boosting the performance of the business sector requires faster rehabilitation or closing down of the 
high number of firms that carry excessive debt burdens. Quickly restructuring corporate debts and putting 
viable firms on the path to recovery would in turn clean-up bank balance sheets allowing banks to focus on 
new lending and reallocating capital to new and more productive firms. An efficient insolvency regime is a pre-requisite for achieving this but so far the Spanish insolvency 
law has proved of little use to facilitate the restructuring of viable firms and swift liquidation of unviable 
ones (Mora-Sanguinetti and Fuentes, 2012). Business bankruptcy rates in Spain were among the lowest in 
the world before the 2009 economic crisis. Existing procedures appeared to be unduly complex and 
judicial resolution periods tended to be too long, which is part of the broader judicial efficiency problems 
discussed above. In 2012 regular procedures lasted an average of 649 days, while the duration of simplified 
procedures, that are supposed to be shorter, was 665 days (Van Hemmen, 2013). To correct this 
inefficiency the government introduced several changes within its entrepreneurship law. The government 
has recently reviewed them again (Decree of refinancing agreements and debt restructuring) to make it 
easier to get prior agreements on write-offs, maturity extensions and debt-for-equity swaps, and to reduce 
the majority needed for creditor agreements to be approved. In many cases liabilities with tax and social 
security authorities account for a very significant part of the debt, but so far both authorities have not been 
allowed to restructure their debts. Clear guidelines for the participation of both authorities in the 
restructuring process should be established. Bankruptcy rates are low for SMEs, and, in particular, for micro enterprises. In contrast with the low 
incidence of business bankruptcies, business related mortgage foreclosures have soared during the crisis. 
Small business owners tend to finance their firms with loans secured on their homes, and, if lenders 
repossess the collateral, that will be reflected as residential foreclosures instead of as bankruptcies. The 
small rate of small businesses filing for bankruptcy suggests that these procedures are more costly and 
drawn out than the main alternative procedure, the mortgage foreclosure, and that the personal bankruptcy 
law is unattractive to the individual debtor (García-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti, 2013b). The challenges 
ahead are to enable viable SMEs to restructure unsustainable debt and get recapitalised; and to ensure 
nonviable SMEs cease their activities in an orderly fashion to allow effective redeployment of capital and 
other resources. Insolvency procedures often fail to meet the needs of SMEs (European Commission, 
2012). Alternative procedures, proportionate to the size of the business, should be put in place to make 
adequate solutions available for all types of SMEs. Given the limited capacity of the judicial system and 
the need for rapid resolutions, promoting and facilitating voluntary out-of-court restructurings for SMEs 
could provide a cost-effective and swift alternative to court supervised proceedings. The government recently introduced new out-of-court pre-insolvency payment procedures for SMEs 
(acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos). The payment agreement must be approved by 60% of creditors, have a 
maximum haircut of 25%, and involve a payment moratorium limited to three years. Public creditors are 
excluded from the negotiations. This new procedure is a decisive step to alleviate financial distress of 
SMEs in a swift manner. Nevertheless, its current configuration does not offer sufficient incentives for its 
use. The procedure could be made more effective by permitting the debt haircut to go above the current 
25% maximum and the payment moratorium above three years. A significant proportion of SMEs' debts 
are liabilities with tax and social security authorities. Integrating these liabilities in the payment plan would 
be an additional step to make these procedures more effective. These procedures are facilitated by 
mediators. The government is planning to change the way mediators are selected, appointed and 
remunerated. This is welcome since the current system does not provide sufficient incentives to avoid long 
processes ending in the final liquidation of firms. ECO/WKP(2014)69 37 The recent entrepreneurship law created a new category to foster entrepreneurship (empresario de 
responsabilidad limitada), according to which the entrepreneur can preserve their main residence from any 
payment obligation originating from their entrepreneurship activities. This category puts undue emphasis 
on protecting housing assets to the detriment of other type of assets. In general, setting-up insolvency 
procedures providing clear and swift procedures for debt restructuring and resolution has been found to 
have a far more decisive impact in fostering entrepreneurship than partial measures to protect 
entrepreneurs' assets. In this sense, introducing a new personal insolvency framework allowing for a 
discharge of unresolved personal debt after liquidation or a payment plan for financially responsible 
individuals, as existing in other EU countries, is a preferable alternative to tackle over-indebtedness of 
individual entrepreneurs and increase entrepreneurship. Existing alternatives are too narrow in scope and 
too stringent in their requirements to be broadly used or to have a significant impact. Moving towards more diversified financing Bank-lending has been the predominant financing source in Spain. The crisis boosted bank 
disintermediation, in particular for larger firms that have increased issuance of corporate debt (Figure 28). 
Issuance remains though below those observed in more developed corporate bond markets, such as 
Germany, France or Italy. Market funding opportunities for SMEs have been more limited though. 
Moreover, SMEs have more difficulties to establish new banking relationships and they tend to use as 
collateral real-estate assets, whose value has fallen, which complicates further their access to credit. Figure 28. Structure of non-financial corporations' liabilities Net incurrence of liabilities, billion euros Source: Bank of Spain (2014), Financial Accounts of the Spanish Economy (database), July. The downsizing of the banking sector makes the development of alternative, capital market-based 
sources of finance more urgent, especially for SMEs. Developing non-bank financing, would also reduce 
banks' market power, which may help to make Spanish bank lending rates more responsive to monetary 
policy. Where banks in Europe face limited competition, and firms depend on them, financing constraints 
for SMEs have been found to be higher (Ryan et al., 2014). Moreover, in normal downturns, healthy banks 
help to cushion the shock, but when recessions have coincided with financial crises the impact on GDP has 
been three times more severe for bank-oriented economies than for market-oriented ones (Gambacorta 
et al., 2014). Access to bank finance can be particularly challenging for young and innovative firms that do -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 2004

Total ECO/WKP(2014)69 38 not have collateral or a track record. Thus, developing non-bank financing channels would make the 
Spanish financial system more balanced, more resistant to shocks and more prone to entrepreneurship. 
With that aim the government has launched a wide array of initiatives, including developing alternative 
securities markets, improving the public guarantee system and venture capital initiatives (discussed below). 
The effects of these initiatives will unfold progressively over time, and in the meantime measures to 
improve firms' access to bank finance are also required. Improving access to bank financing One way to improve the financing conditions of SMEs is to provide banks with funds to be used to 
make loans to SMEs. In Spain, this is done via the Official Credit institute (Instituto de Crédito Oficial, 
ICO) intermediation facilities. Through these facilities ICO provides funds to banks at a lower cost on the 
condition that the funds are lent for a certain kind of activity or type of firm, including SMEs. Banks 
assume fully the credit risk and charge a premium to remunerate their operating costs and the credit risk 
assumed. ICO sets a ceiling for this premium, which currently stands at about 4%. The German 
government agency Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), OSEO in France and the European Investment 
bank (EIB) also use these kind of facilities. Via these facilities ICO granted credit amounting to EUR 14 
billion in 2013 (an increase of 20% with respect to 2012), having a material impact in the incipient 
recovery in the flow of new credit. In the first half of 2014 credit disposition amounted to EUR 10.9 
billion, which is a record figure. In the short-term, these facilities can be effective in improving firms' 
access to finance. Nevertheless, in the medium-term, the emphasis should move towards more market-
based alternatives currently under development (discussed below) and to make firms less dependent on 
publicly supported bank finance. Well-structured mutual guarantee schemes (MGS) can also play a decisive role in improving firms' 
access to bank finance. They spread some of the risk and thereby enable banks to extend loans to firms that 
would find it difficult to access credit otherwise or to do it under better conditions (Columba et al., 2009). 
For banks they can act as an important risk mitigation mechanism since they do not need to provision loans 
guaranteed by MGS. In Spain, MGS are a special type of limited liability society with two types of shareholders: 
 " participatory members " , who subscribe some shares against the guarantee service (currently about 
100 000 SMEs); and  " protective members " , which include local authorities, banks, chambers of commerce 
and other entities that are involved in SME development. Typically, the guarantees issued by MGS cover 
100% of the bank loan. The Spanish system of public support to MGS is based on counter-guarantees 
granted by CERSA (Compañía Española de Reafianzamiento, SA), which is under the Ministry of 
Industry, Energy and Tourism (OECD, 2013b). CERSA can cover up to 75% of the risk, depending on size 
and conditions of the loan. The rest of the risk is covered by the MGS themselves. A new measure 
introduced recently in Spanish regulation allows banks benefiting from a guarantee from a MGS to request 
the reimbursement of its claim directly from the counter-guarantor, CERSA. This reduces significantly the 
counterparty risk of the bank with the MGS. MGS could play an important role in the current financing environment, where SMEs face relatively 
strict financing conditions and banks must ensure a high level of capital quality. MGS offer the competitive 
advantage of being close to the borrowers. This allows an effective monitoring and screening of loan 
applications. It is estimated that banks can obtain 45% risk-weighted yields on operations with guarantees, 
compared with 16.5% without guarantees and that the cost of the loan for the SME would be reduced by 
250 basis points (PWC, 2014). Moreover, MGS tend to provide firms with long-term financing, while 
SMEs usually obtain short-term loans from banks. Therefore they can contribute to SMEs moving towards 
a more balanced financing term structure. ECO/WKP(2014)69 39 The use of MGS in Spain is lower than in other countries with a similar firm structure such as Italy 
and Portugal. The volume of outstanding guarantees amounted to 0.6% of GDP in Spain in 2011, 
compared with 2.2% and 1.9% in Italy and Portugal (OECD, 2013b). A more extended use of MGS in 
Spain will likely require a change in scale. There are currently 23 MGS in Spain, but some do not have 
sufficient capital to significantly expand their activity (PWC, 2014). In general, a change in scale, with 
mergers or consolidation can help reduce the relative costs of the service, as well as broaden the offer of 
guarantee instruments (OECD, 2013b). Larger MGS can also provide more professional management and 
screening tools. A consolidation process is underway, after the entrepreneurship law increased equity and 
resources requirements for MGS. At the same time, there is a trade-off between efficient scale and 
proximity to borrowers, which historically has been MGS' competitive advantage. Strengthening the 
public counter-guarantee by further increasing the resources of CERSA may also be required. That would 
imply an increase in contingent liabilities for the government. Thus, it should be accompanied by regular 
stress tests to check the solvency of the guarantee system. Developing alternatives to bank-lending Besides bank loans, alternative financing sources are important, especially for high-growth firms that 
want to diversify their funding basis or need a mix of debt and equity. As Spain's recovery gains steam, it 
will be critical to supplement bank lending with new sources of finance, so that bank capacity constraints 
do not hold back the necessary financing of new business. One of the main alternatives is venture capital, 
which has remained underdeveloped in Spain so far (Figure 29). To contribute to the development of the 
venture capital market, the government has launched a programme called Fond-ICO Global. It is the first 
public venture capital  " fund of funds "  created in Spain, and has a budget of EUR 1.2 billion. It seeks to 
promote the creation of privately managed venture capital funds investing in Spanish companies at 
different stages of development, with the goal to mobilise around EUR 5 billion of funds. The venture 
capital funds in which Fond-ICO Global invests must have a majority of private capital and a presence in 
Spain. The amount of capital invested by Fond-ICO Global in each fund will depend on the stages in which 
it invests and the size of the fund. The emphasis in ensuring a majority of private capital is welcomed, 
since government venture capital efforts have been found to have a positive impact when they have a 
minority position and not when they are leaders (Brander et al., 2012; Grilli and Murtinu, 2014). The 
selection of venture capital funds in which Fond-ICO participates is done via successive tender procedures. 
It would be important to ensure a systematic and unified evaluation of the results of the first tenders so that 
future calls can be adapted based on the results of that evaluation. Figure 29. Venture capital investment Per cent of GDP, 2012 1 1.

0.36 ECO/WKP(2014)69 40 Stock markets geared towards smaller firms are important complement to venture capital schemes. 
Contrary to Germany or the United Kingdom where alternative stock exchanges are vibrant, the Spanish 
alternative market, MAB (Mercado Alternativo Bursátil), has remained less developed: 22 firms are 
currently listed, reflecting that not many SMEs comply with some of the requirements to list in the market 
(e.g. estimated value of the free float above EUR 2 million). Spain has also recently launched an 
alternative fixed-income market (MARF, in its Spanish acronym). MARF's potential issuers are large 
unlisted companies, with EBITDA levels of at least EUR 12 million. Given these requirements, a massive 
entry of issuers in this new market should not be expected (Guijarro and Mañueco, 2013). So far six 
issuances have taken place. MARF targets solely institutional investors and the minimum unit issue 
amount is EUR 100 000. The examples of Germany and Norway, with markets raising volumes of funds 
that represent 1% and 0.13% of GDP, are good benchmarks for MARF's potential capacity. Nevertheless, 
the predominance of small firms in the corporate sector in Spain will constrain the total funds that can be 
raised compared to other European economies more populated by medium-sized companies. Other measures would also help firms financing Access to credit by SMEs would also be improved if assessing borrower creditworthiness becomes 
easier. Mechanisms to facilitate the regular production of uniform, quality data on the most important 
aspects of the business of SMEs would help. Banque de France has been identified as the institution 
collecting the most comprehensive set of data on SMEs (IIF, 2013), and this is coupled with the lowest 
spread between loans to large companies and loans to SMEs in the euro area. Banque de France requires 
detailed reporting on all loans larger than EUR 25 000, and from this data they compile credit scores on 
around 280 000 companies operating in France, the majority of which are SMEs. The credit scores and 
related financial information, including aggregated bank claims for an individual SME, are made available 
to French banks. Establishing a comprehensive central credit registry similar to the Banque de France 
model would significantly reduce information asymmetries and contribute to banks providing SMEs with 
loans at better terms. The current framework of public financial support for SMEs, which rests on a broad variety of 
instruments provided by various institutions, could also be simplified to make it easier for SMEs to absorb 
information and access support. Simplification and consolidation may increase the effectiveness and cost-
efficiency of the system and avoid duplications. In addition to ICO there are several agencies and 
institutions providing financing support to Spanish companies such as Compañía Española de Financiación 
del Desarrollo (COFIDES) and Empresa Nacional de Innovación, SA (ENISA). In some cases these 
institutions have cross-shareholdings and the instruments they offer are very similar (Ayuso, 2013). 
Concentrating all financing support in ICO may contribute to achieving economies of scale and 
exploitation of all possible synergies, in addition to offering firms a clearer access point to support. The financing of Spanish firms, in particular SMEs, is also seriously impaired by very late payments 
-or even failure to pay – in commercial transactions. To combat that, a new law (Ley de Morosidad) has 
established maximum terms of payment in commercial relations. These legal terms are compulsory and 
binding and therefore cannot be lengthened by mutual agreement of the parties. The maximum term is 
30 days for administrative entities (from delivery of the document that accredits the total or partial 
fulfilment of the contract) and 60 days for private companies (from the date of receipt of the goods or 
rendering of services), in line with European Union directives. While payment terms have decreased, they 
remain above the maximums established by the law. The authorities should introduce sanctions for those 
firms systematically incurring late payments above the legal limits. ECO/WKP(2014)69 41 Recommendations to move towards a more dynamic business sector Boosting start-ups  Revamp the licence and permits system and reduce regulatory fragmentation by implementing the market unity law.  Sep-up one-stop shops for issuing and accepting all notifications and licenses that are required to open up a business. Facilitating business growth  Broaden the corporate tax base, lower the rate and eliminate regimes for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  Review other size-dependant policies and regulations. Adapt them to avoid them becoming obstacles to firms' growth. Fostering internationalisation  Integrate internationalisation and innovation policies under a single responsibility.  Establish formal mechanisms of collaboration between Spanish multinationals and SMEs attempting to gain access to new markets.  Strengthen the port regulator and ensure that entry barriers are eliminated. Open access to stevedore activities. Strengthening competition  Make access to professions easier. Reduce the number of professions for which being a member of the professional body is required. Ensure that membership fees do not act as barriers to entry to the profession.  Progressively reduce the degree of vertical integration in the electricity market.  Widen the scope of actions of electricity and gas regulators.  Favour entry in the oil distribution market to increase contestability and reduce anti-competitive practices. Improving judicial efficiency  Pursue efforts to increase efficiency in the judicial system by ensuring a broader deployment of information technology tools, fostering mediation alternatives and increasing competition in the legal profession.  Replace special administrative appeals with the public administration with time-limited mediation procedures. Tackling over-indebtedness  Increase incentives for the use of out-of-court and in-court insolvency procedures by SMEs by allowing more flexible payment plans, higher debt haircuts and participation from tax authorities.  Introduce a new out-of-court negotiated personal insolvency regime.  Establish clear guidelines for the participation of tax authorities in debt restructuring processes. Improving firms financing  Continue to promote diversified financing sources for firms. In the short-term, adjust the Official Credit Institute (ICO) intermediation facilities to demand and make further use of mutual guarantee companies. ECO/WKP(2014)69 42 Recommendations to move towards a more dynamic business sector (cont'd)  Make government financing support to firms more effective by considering a reduction in the number of government agencies involved and concentrating support in ICO.  Ensure that private sector lead is maintained in venture capital schemes financed by FOND-ICO Global. Evaluate the results of first tenders and adapt consequently the subsequent calls.  Establish a comprehensive credit registry for SMEs similar to the Banque de France model, including information on payment performance, financial transactions and balance sheet positions. Make that 
information available to all banks.  Introduce sanctions for those firms systematically incurring in late payments above the legal limits. Bibliography Acs, Z.J., D.B. Audretsch, P. Braunerhjelm and B. Carlsson (2006),  " Growth and Entrepreneurship: An
