	<note type="other">About the International Transport Forum<lb/> The International Transport Forum at the OECD is an intergovernmental organisation with 57 member<lb/> countries. It acts as a think tank for transport policy and organises the Annual Summit of transport<lb/> ministers. ITF is the only global body that covers all transport modes. It is administratively integrated with<lb/> the OECD, yet politically autonomous.<lb/></note>

	<p type="introduction">ITF works for transport policies that improve peoples&apos; lives. Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding<lb/> of the role of transport in economic growth, environmental sustainability and social inclusion and to raise<lb/> the public profile of transport policy.<lb/> ITF organises global dialogue for better transport. We act as a platform for discussion and pre-negotiation<lb/> of policy issues across all transport modes. We analyse trends, share knowledge and promote exchange<lb/> among transport decision makers and civil society. ITF&apos;s Annual Summit is the world&apos;s largest gathering of<lb/> transport ministers and the leading global platform for dialogue on transport policy.<lb/> Our member countries are:</p>

They are launched in areas where CPB member companies identify an<lb/> emerging issue in transport policy or an innovation challenge to the transport system. Led by the ITF, work<lb/> is carried out in a collaborative fashion in working groups consisting of CPB member companies, external<lb/> experts and ITF staff.<lb/> Many thanks to the members of the Corporate Partnership Board companies involved in this work: Ford,<lb/> Google, PTV Group, Transdev, Uber.<lb/> The report draws conclusions from a workshop held in San Francisco on 21 November 2016.
