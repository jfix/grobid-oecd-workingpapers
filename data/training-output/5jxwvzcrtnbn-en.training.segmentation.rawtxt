THE CASE OF KAZAKHSTAN By Jibran J Punthakey 1 OECD Eurasia Competitiveness Programme, Global Relations Secretariat Abstract: Policy complementarities have often been overlooked in transition economies, leading to the 
exclusion or partial adoption of reforms. This paper examines the key determinants of successful 
transition strategies, and concludes that an approach exploiting complementary relationships and 
interactions between policies is most likely to result in a welfare improvement. Based on nine policy 
areas from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transition Indicators 
database, composite indicators measuring reform implementation and complementarity are 
constructed. Panel data estimates for 30 countries over the period 1989 to 2012 demonstrate a positive 
association between improvements in reform complementarity and economic growth. Moreover, the 
effects are found to persist over time for up to two years after the initial policy change, and are robust 
to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables. Applying these findings to the case of Kazakhstan 
illustrates that comprehensive reforms to a targeted group of complementary policies generate 
sustained increases in output growth, whereas a partial reform strategy results in a loss of welfare. JEL classification codes: P2; O40; C33. Keywords: Complementarity; structural reforms; reform indicators; economic growth; transition

INTRODUCTION The economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) 2 and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) 3 
underwent a profound transition during the 1990s, moving from a governance structure dominated by 
central planning to the adoption of open, market-oriented mechanisms and institutions. As the process 
of economic liberalisation began, many commonalities could be observed across the structural reforms 
that were implemented: countries made efforts to remove barriers to trade, increase capital mobility, 
privatise state-owned businesses and invest in infrastructure. However, with wide differences being 
observed in countries' growth trajectories and development patterns, transition was neither a simple 
nor a speedy panacea for the economic woes of the time. How can such stark differences in economic performance be explained? Evidence suggests that 
successful transition strategies are contingent on initial conditions and the speed, sequence and manner 
in which distortions are eased or removed (EBRD, 1994). While initial conditions such as the 
historical context, state of the external environment and quality of the existing policy and institutional 
framework have a determinate impact on economic performance, they are predominantly beyond the 
control of policy makers. On the other hand, the development of a coherent reform strategy that targets 
the most binding constraints to growth is well within reach. The idea of identifying the  " binding constraints "  or prioritising reforms according to the 
magnitude of their direct impact on welfare was put forth by Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005), 
and is motivated primarily by practical considerations. First, governments have limited administrative 
and political capital at their disposal, and are unlikely to be able to implement multiple and inordinate 
reforms within a given electoral cycle. Second, due to incomplete information about the nature of 
current distortions, an immediate liberalisation of all institutions is nearly impossible. And third, 
owing to the potential for adverse second-best outcomes, basing reform selection on political 
feasibility alone is both ill-advised and prone to failure. The theory of the second-best contends that reform implementation may reduce growth, due to 
the presence of multiple interaction effects across market distortions (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). If 
the removal of all distortions leads to an unambiguous welfare improvement, the second-best 
hypothesis can be said to lend support to the notion of policy complementarities. Specifically, when a 
single reform results in an unexpected welfare loss, it is conceivable that the selective implementation 
of complementary reforms may be welfare enhancing. For instance, without sufficient flexibility in 
labour markets, trade liberalisation may lead to a sub-optimal allocation of resources and will thus be 2. 
Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) comprises Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic and Slovenia. 3. 
The Former Soviet Union (FSU) comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. 
The three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) are included in CEE. 5 ineffective in stimulating growth (Rodrik, 2005). Financial liberalisation is another important 
example: without a stable macroeconomic environment and solid prudential regulations, many 
transition economies were unduly exposed to volatility in international capital markets and a 
heightened risk of systemic crises (Hartwell, 2012). In turn, trade policies and financial sector reform 
also exhibit strong complementarities, as financial intermediaries are often instrumental in assisting 
domestic firms to deal with the adjustment costs associated with increased trade openness (Rodrik, 
2005). Mutual interdependencies between reforms in the context of transition were first investigated in 
detail by Gates, Milgrom and Roberts (1994), and the idea has received increasing attention in the 
literature since (e.g. Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins, 2008; Coricelli and Maurel, 2011). In 
spite of these developments, there is no established consensus that policy complementarities should be 
central to the elaboration of a coherent reform strategy. Indeed, Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) 
suggest it is impracticable to give priority to reforms that induce positive second-best effects, as these 
are typically unobservable ex-ante. This paper contends that the incremental returns to reform in one area are higher when the reform 
leads to greater complementarity in the overall policy framework. By inference, a reform strategy 
based on maximising policy complementarity (or minimising policy dispersion) is essentially 
consistent with an approach anchored in alleviating the  " binding constraints "  to growth. This 
perspective is encouraging as it allows the two ideas to coalesce into one theory, which can form the 
basis of a methodology for reform prioritisation. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the 
economic and structural transformations that took place during transition, and Section 3 offers a series 
of explanations for the strong variability in output performance observed across the transition region. 
The notion of reform complementarities is explored in detail in section 4, and a methodology is 
developed to measure reform levels and complementarity using composite indicators based on the 
EBRD Transition Indicators database. These indicators are then used to examine trajectories of 
structural change in transition economies, and derive empirical estimates of the relationship between 
reforms, complementarity and growth. Section 6 examines the role of reform complementarities in the 
context of the economic transition in Kazakhstan, and recommends future policy priorities based on a 
predictive scenario analysis. The paper concludes with a summary of the findings and potential 
avenues for further research. 2. GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES The transition from central planning to a market economy prompted a number of significant 
structural transformations pertaining to the systems for resource generation and allocation, institutional 
arrangements for the functioning of markets, and role of the state. Enterprises and households were 
forced to adapt their consumption and production decisions to market-based incentive structures. 
Restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the removal of price controls, subsidies and other 
distortions led to an increase in the private sector's role in the economy. And governments were faced 
with an entirely new set of responsibilities, requiring the establishment of effective legal and judicial 
structures, the protection of property rights, the development of secure mechanisms for contract 6 enforcement, and the provision of public goods such as infrastructure, education, health and social 
services. Although the adjustment costs of transition were widely anticipated, the depth and duration of the 
output loss sustained by most countries exceeded even the most pessimistic of forecasts. The 
experience of transition economies during the 1990s has been likened to that of developed economies 
during the Great Depression (World Bank, 2002), and is comparable to output declines observed 
during periods of civil war (Coricelli and Maurel, 2011). Strong differences were observed in 
economic performance across countries, both in terms of the magnitude of the initial recession and the 
length of the subsequent recovery period. Furthermore, the expectation that the countries that endured 
severe output contractions would recover more rapidly was not met, with a number of economies 
remaining mired in a long-term cycle of negative growth rates that lasted for almost an entire decade. 4 Figure 1 illustrates the impact of transition on real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the 
economies of CEE and the FSU. Output fell for five consecutive years in CEE, resulting in a 
cumulative decline of 21 percent between 1989 and 1993. The recovery that ensued lasted for a further 
six years, with income levels finally returning to their 1989 levels in 1999. In contrast, the FSU 
experienced eight consecutive years of falling output, or a cumulative decline of 45 percent between 
1989 and 1996. This was followed by a long, protracted recovery that stalled with the onset of the 
Russian crisis in August 1998, and persisted for a full decade afterwards, with GDP per capita only 
officially surpassing its 1990 level in 2007. Countries in the FSU remain severely exposed to external 
economic shocks, due to the region's strong reliance on exports of primary commodities. Output is 
highly volatile and contracted by 7 percent in 2009 in response to the global economic downturn, 
compared with just 4 percent in CEE. 5 4. 
Output per capita contracted for nine consecutive years in Ukraine, eight consecutive years in Russia 
and Tajikistan, and seven consecutive years in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan. The 
steepest declines were observed in Georgia (77%), Tajikistan (72%), Azerbaijan (66%), Moldova 
(66%) and Ukraine (60%). 5. 
See Figure 11 in Appendix A for a comparison of GDP per capita growth rates in CEE and the FSU. 7 Figure 1. Evolution of real GDP per capita, 1989-2012 Note: Regional aggregates are population-weighted. Source: Author's calculations, based on data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WB/WDI). Perhaps the most noteworthy consequence of transition was manifested in the emergence of 
privately-owned enterprises, many of which were established through the privatisation of SOEs. 
Figure 2 depicts the progression of the share of GDP accounted for by the private sector in CEE and 
the FSU between 1994 and 2010, based on official country-level estimates from the EBRD. Private 
enterprises are a key ingredient in any market economy, and the extent to which output is generated by 
private enterprises is therefore a salient indicator of progress in transition. As illustrated in Figure 2, 
private sector activity has flourished in CEE, increasing from an average of 50 percent of GDP in 1994 
to 74 percent of GDP in 2010. In the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and the Slovak Republic, the 
share has remained stable at 80 percent since 2002. On the other hand, the private sector's share in 
output in the FSU has been stagnant since 1997, at an average of 65 percent (levels as low as 25 and 
30 percent were recorded in Turkmenistan and Belarus in 2010). 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Index (1989 = 100) Transition Economies

outcomes were observed across the transition region. Price liberalisation and the opening of markets to 
external trade resulted in hyperinflation and substantial shifts in relative productivity levels across 
sectors, rendering many existing activities unprofitable. The abolition of subsidies to agriculture and 
industry (energy, fertiliser and transport costs were often heavily subsidised) led to a rapid 
transformation in the structural composition of output. Specifically, the share of agriculture shrank 
from 18 percent of total output in 1989 to 10 percent in 1995, while the industrial sector declined from 
49 percent of GDP in 1989 to 36 percent in 1995. To a certain extent, these sectoral shifts were offset 
by growth in the services sector. 6 Real export growth and inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) were central to the transition. 
Here too, it is important to note the diverging trends across countries. Export growth was strongest in 
CEE, driven by demand from industrial countries. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic attracted 
the lion's share of FDI inflows, which were vital as a means to attract capital, modernise industrial 
processes and support technological upgrading. On the other hand, growth in exports and FDI was 
considerably weaker in the FSU, and mostly concentrated in countries with large natural resource 
endowments such as Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (World Bank, 2002). Average poverty rates also increased throughout the transition region in the 1990s, provoked by 
the collapse in output and higher levels of unemployment and income inequality. However, much of 
the rise in unemployment and inequality in CEE was productive in nature, driven by the liquidation 
and restructuring of inefficient SOEs, and increased returns to education and entrepreneurship. 
Furthermore, government transfers and redistribution mechanisms in the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic worked to counterbalance the trend. Conversely, sharp 
increases in poverty and inequality in the FSU were perpetuated by corruption, rent-seeking and 
regulatory capture. In addition, many households had to rely on subsistence agriculture in order to 6.

countries such as Armenia, Tajikistan and Russia (World Bank, 2000). 7 3. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TRANSITION STRATEGIES  " Absent definitive theories, views on growth have been shaped by facts and changed by 
experience. "  Such is the nature of our current understanding of the drivers and dynamics of economic 
growth, as affirmed by the World Bank's 2005 report titled Economic Growth in the 1990s – Learning 
from a decade of reform. Indeed, with the benefit of almost a quarter of a century of hindsight, a 
number of important lessons can be drawn from the economic and political transition that took place 
following the end of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Variations in economic performance across the transition region have motivated a large range of 
empirical and theoretical research. Typically, studies focus on the role of initial conditions and the 
choice of policy reforms in explaining cross-country differences in economic growth rates (Falcetti, 
Raiser and Sanfey, 2002). Attempts have also been made to identify optimal reform pathways and 
derive conclusions relating to the ideal speed, sequence and design of transition policies and strategies. 
This section reviews the existing body of literature and develops an understanding of the core 
components in a successful transition strategy. 3.1 The role of initial conditions Consensus dictates that initial conditions were of great consequence in determining the rate at 
which incomes in transition economies converged with those prevailing in advanced countries. In spite 
of their common ideological perspective, countries in CEE and the FSU differed across a wide range 
of structural, economic, political and institutional characteristics. In the beginning of transition, 
income per capita ranged between USD 1 400 (Albania) and USD 9 200 (Slovenia) in CEE, and USD 
2 740 (Uzbekistan) and USD 7 720 (Russia) in the FSU. 8 Income differences were frequently 
associated with variations in levels of industrialisation, urbanisation and trade dependence. Other 
relevant factors include location (as countries in Central Europe were able to develop stronger trade 
links with Western Europe), the availability of natural resources 9 , the history of prior reforms and the 
level of institutional development (De Melo et al., 2001). According to an empirical study conducted by the World Bank (2002), initial conditions were a 
significant determinant of growth between 1990 and 1994, during the early years of the transition 7. 
According to the World Bank (2000), Armenia, Tajikistan and Russia registered the highest increases 
in inequality out of all transition economies. In 1996-99, inequality levels (measured by the Gini 
coefficient) had reached nearly twice the levels recorded in 1987-90. 8. 
Income per capita is based on GNP in 1989 US dollars, adjusted for purchasing power parity. 9. 
Several energy-rich countries in the FSU, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and 
Turkmenistan, were able to use their natural resource wealth as a pretext for delayed progress in 
structural reforms. This ultimately took led to the deterioration of their long-run growth potential. 10 recession. Over time, however, the importance of initial conditions declined and was superseded by 
the impact of progress in policy reform. Countries with a strong commitment to reform were able to 
overcome their inherited disadvantages, sustain political support and secure higher rates of economic 
growth in the long run. Others entered transition with propitious beginnings, and emerged with inferior 
growth rates as a result of incoherent and partial reforms. 3.2 Key determinants of success in transition strategies Broadly put, transition strategies can be distinguished by the speed of implementation, the 
comprehensiveness of reforms, and the internal sequencing of the policy package. These three 
concepts are assessed below. A key bone of contention in the literature is the debate between the proponents of  " shock 
therapy "  and those who support a  " gradualist "  approach to reform. 10 The arguments in favour of 
gradualism are primarily based on political and financial constraints. For instance, Dewatripont and 
Roland (1992) suggest that in the presence of political opposition to reforms, a move to improve 
allocative efficiency (through the liquidation of SOEs) may entail significant financial costs (e.g. 
compensation schemes for public-sector workers). In this situation a  " big bang "  approach to 
restructuring is not guaranteed to improve overall welfare, particularly when the short-term financial 
costs of compensation exceed the long-term gains arising from a more productive allocation of labour. 
Partial reforms are therefore a preferred alternative, as they allow workers with the lowest opportunity 
costs to exit inefficient industries first, thereby reducing the financial burden of compensation 
schemes. This perspective is also reflected by Aghion and Blanchard (1994), who note that rapid 
restructuring of SOEs may be undesirable due to opposition from state workers and the potential 
indirect costs of high unemployment. On the other hand, the advocates of shock therapy argue that high unemployment and a drop in 
output are unavoidable consequences, and as such a piecemeal approach can only increase the costs of 
transition. Countries often have a narrow window of opportunity in which to implement reforms (e.g. 
at the beginning of transition). Failure to do so can result in a  " partial reform paradox " , where the 
government becomes susceptible to regulatory capture by oligarchs and other vested interests, leading 
to a low equilibrium level of reform (World Bank, 2002). Moreover, Sachs and Woo (1994) contend 
that shock therapy was unavoidable in transition economies, owing to the large distortions created by 
over-industrialisation, inefficient subsidies, excessive social spending and poor macroeconomic 
management. They compare China's experience with gradualist reforms in the 1980s to the shock 
treatment conducted in CEE and the FSU, and conclude that gradualism was successful in China due 
to the large productivity differential between the inefficient agricultural sector and the new industrial 
sector. In contrast, rapid enterprise restructuring in the transition region was necessary to free up 
resources for the newly emerging private sector, but the relative opportunity cost for state workers 
exiting heavily subsidised industries was substantially higher. Comparing countries' experiences in practice provides a crucial acid test for both sides of the 
debate. Many of the successful countries in CEE undertook radical liberalisation in the early 1990s, 
including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Albania, Estonia and Latvia. On the other hand, both 
Hungary and Slovenia implemented reforms in a slower and more co-ordinated manner, and were also 
able to achieve similarly high levels of growth. Other countries began with a radical liberalisation 
programme but were unable to maintain momentum in reform implementation, and went on to achieve 
growth with varying degrees of success (e.g. Bulgaria, Lithuania, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, 10. 
 " Shock therapy "  is invariably referred to in the literature as a  " big bang "  approach to reform. The 
terms  " gradualist "  and  " piecemeal "  are also used interchangeably in the context of reform strategies. 11 Romania and Russia). In reality, the debate of shock therapy versus gradualism may have been 
inconsequential, as many of the countries that tried shock therapy only did so in response to a severe 
crisis. A further issue in the literature on transition strategies relates to sequencing, or the order in which 
reforms are implemented. Dabrowski (1996) outlines three strategic guidelines on the ideal 
progression of structural reforms during transition. First, radical and comprehensive reforms to the macroeconomic environment are necessary at the 
very beginning of transition. In the early 1990s, price controls, subsidies and other distortions had 
created a large monetary overhang and suppressed inflation in most transition economies. Given that 
domestic and external liberalisation would inevitably result in corrective inflation, strong monetary 
and fiscal discipline was essential to rein in inflationary expectations and prevent prices from 
spiralling out of control. Second, price liberalisation is indispensable to allow for the efficient reallocation of resources, 
and should also be undertaken early in the transition process. Prices are a fulcrum for the development 
of market-based incentives, and their liberalisation facilitates the implementation of many other 
structural reforms, including fiscal stabilisation, privatisation and competition policy. Conversely, 
attempts to reduce the prevalence of monopolies and encourage private sector development are likely 
to be ineffective if prices have not been deregulated. Reforms to trade and the foreign exchange 
system should also take place after price liberalisation, as the adjustment of the domestic economy to 
international prices is a vital means to stimulate competitiveness in external markets. Third, Dabrowski (1996) postulates that privatisation and enterprise restructuring should only 
proceed after significant advances have been made in the areas of stabilisation and liberalisation. In 
Russia, rapid privatisation took place while progress in the areas of macroeconomic stabilisation, 
competition policy and external liberalisation languished. This created incentives for rent-seeking and 
profiteering in the private sector, at the expense of market-based competition. Using the existing literature on transition strategies as a basis, one can conclude that 
comprehensiveness, or progress in overall reform implementation, appears to be undeniably associated 
with higher growth. However, the question of the ideal speed and sequencing of implementation 
remains inconclusive. Not all fast-reforming countries have been rewarded equally with growth, and 
several slow reformers have managed to achieve high growth rates against all odds. Moreover, 
countries exhibit strong heterogeneity in initial conditions, and as such there is no unique optimal 
sequence for transition. 12 4. REFORM COMPLEMENTARITIES: THE  " MISSING LINK "  IN TRANSITION 
STRATEGIES? Transition is a complex and multifaceted process, and there is much contention on the principles 
underlying the design of a successful policy package. Many of the conflicting ideologies that have 
emerged in the literature were reviewed in section 3. This section seeks to exploit these ideas, and 
advance the notion that reform complementarities are a key ingredient that has often been overlooked 
in the analysis of transition strategies. In addition, composite indicators measuring the overall level of 
reform implementation and the complementarity across reforms are developed and used to compare 
trajectories of structural and institutional change in transition economies. 4.1 Exploring complementarities in the transition process This paper does not advocate for the superiority of a particular speed or sequence of reforms as 
such (although a comprehensive reform package is presumed to be unequivocally good for growth). 
Rather, a successful transition strategy should focus on alleviating the  " binding constraints "  to growth, 
and thus the preferred speed and sequence of reforms will naturally vary across countries and settings 
(Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco, 2005). This perspective is confirmed by Staehr (2005), who 
undertakes a principal component analysis to test for the effect of the speed and sequencing of reforms 
on output performance in transition economies. The findings indicate that while comprehensive, 
broad-based reforms have a strong impact on growth, the speed of implementation has no significant 
influence. Furthermore, the results are unable to identify a single optimal sequence for transition 
(although some particular arrangements of reforms are found to be positively associated with growth). More fundamentally, the debate over the optimal speed and sequencing of transition policies 
seems to have neglected a crucial point: the existence of complementary relationships between 
reforms. Take the conflicting perspectives of shock therapy and gradualism, for instance. The 
proponents of shock therapy (Sachs and Woo, 1994) argue that a rapid approach to enterprise 
restructuring is needed to mobilise inefficient resources, while the advocates of gradualist theory 
(Dewatripont and Roland, 1992; Aghion and Blanchard, 1994) contend that excessive political and 
financial costs justify a slow and measured pace to implementation. In reality, both perspectives are 
correct. The liquidation and restructuring of inefficient SOEs will necessarily free up resources and 
entail costs, regardless of the speed of reform. However, these policies are condemned to fail if they 
are not adequately complemented with measures to stimulate returns to entrepreneurship and private 
sector activity. Creating a competitive business climate allows new firms to absorb the assets and 
labour of old enterprises, overcome the initial loss of output from restructuring, and sustain growth in 
the medium to long term (World Bank, 2002). The choice of speed should depend on practical issues, 
such as political feasibility and the ability of individuals and firms to adjust to the new environment 
and respond to incentives for wealth creation. Reform complementarities have also been somewhat overlooked in the literature on sequencing. 
For example, Dabrowski (1996) uses Russia's experience with mass-privatisation in the early 1990s to 
justify the claim that macroeconomic stabilisation and price liberalisation must precede privatisation 
reforms. However, this theory is at odds with the fact that privatisation has a direct impact on the 
sustainability of macroeconomic reforms. The Bulgarian experience is symbolic in this respect: the 
government introduced a comprehensive stabilisation and liberalisation package in 1991; however 
progress in large-scale privatisation was slow. By the end of 1994, the government (including the 
national Privatisation Agency) had only supervised 185 privatisation transactions out of a total of 
3,500 (World Bank, 1995). This led to rent-seeking, asset stripping and significant pressure on the 13 state budget. Thus the more fitting conclusion to draw is one that emphasises the strong 
complementarities between stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation. Private ownership creates 
incentives for the pursuit of profits, through efficient resource allocation and higher productivity 
levels. The elimination of subsidies and price controls encourages firms to devote their efforts to 
relevant activities that add value to the economy. And macroeconomic stabilisation supports consumer 
and producer confidence by reducing inflationary expectations, preventing hyperinflation and 
providing a stable investment climate. The strong complementarities between these policies imply that 
inattention to one particular area can lead to unintended and catastrophic consequences such as weak 
incentives, inefficient resource allocation and rapidly accelerating inflation. The presence of reform complementarities has two important implications: First, the returns to 
reform implementation are amplified by the implementation of other complementary reforms. And 
second, neglecting to undertake complementary reforms can substantially diminish the returns to an 
existing reform. This second corollary is strikingly reminiscent of the theory of the second-best, which 
affirms that in the presence of numerous distortions, the welfare effects of the removal of any one 
distortion are ambiguous, and may be either positive, negative or neutral (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). 
In the context of transition strategies, the relevant conclusion to be drawn is that countries should 
develop an approach based on maximising complementarity across reforms. This is essentially 
consistent with Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) who recommend targeting the  " binding 
constraints "  to growth, as these areas are expected to have a strong positive impact on welfare. By 
prioritising reforms that have strong complementary relationships with the existing policy framework, 
countries can avoid negative second-best effects and focus on the policies that are most likely to be 
welfare enhancing. 4.2 Measuring reform complementarities and progress in transition Having established a theoretical framework for complementarity, the remainder of this section 
turns to questions of measurement by developing a methodology to quantify reform complementarities 
in the context of transition. As a necessary first step, a formal definition for complementarity is 
adopted, based on Topkis (1978) and Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins (2008). Suppose an objective function í µí±(@BULLET) depends on two reform areas (í µí±¥, í µí±¦). Each area has two 
possible values: reform (í µí±¥ í µí±í µí± í µí±¦) or no reform (í µí±¥′ í µí±í µí± í µí±¦′). Hence the two reforms are said to be 
complementary if the following condition is met: 
í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦ ′ ) − í µí±(í µí±¥ ′ , í µí±¦ ′ ) ≤ í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦) − í µí±(í µí±¥ ′ , í µí±¦) (1) This means that the return to implementing reform í µí±¥ is greater when reform í µí±¦ has already been 
implemented, and vice-versa. It is worth noting that this condition holds when í µí±(í µí±¥, í µí±¦) is monotonically increasing in í µí±¥ and í µí±¦ (i.e. í µí¼ 2 í µí±(í µí±¥,í µí±¦) 
í µí¼í µí±¥í µí¼í µí±¦ ≥ 0 ). Extending the concept of complementarity to a set of í µí± reforms, í µí±(@BULLET) is  " supermodular "  if 
complementary relationships exist for each and every pair of policies (Topkis, 1998; Braga de Macedo 
and Oliveira Martins, 2008). This implies that complementarities exist throughout the entire policy 
package, and the adoption of any one subset of complementary reforms will increase the incremental 
returns to implementing the remaining set of reforms (Gates, Milgrom and Roberts, 1994). Section 4.1 
identified several plausible examples of complementary relationships between reforms. To illustrate 
that linkages and synergies exist across the entire policy framework, a summary of pair-wise 
complementarities for ten major areas of structural reform is provided in Table 1 in Appendix A. In 
practice, policy linkages will not be uniform and equal in magnitude. Nevertheless, the assumption of 14 supermodularity (all reforms are complementary, but some reforms are more complementary than 
others) is crucial as it allows for the construction of a composite indicator to measure the level of 
complementarity across reforms. This paper uses the EBRD Transition Indicators to measure progress in transition for 30 
countries, from 1989 to 2012. The full list of countries covered is provided in Table 4 in Appendix B, 
and includes all of the CEE and FSU countries, as well as Turkey and Mongolia. 11 The indicators 
cover nine major areas of structural reform: large-scale privatisation, small-scale privatisation, 
governance and enterprise restructuring, price liberalisation, trade and the foreign exchange system, 
competition policy, banking reform and interest rate liberalisation, securities markets and non-bank 
financial institutions, and infrastructure. The scores for each indicator vary between 1 (no progress in 
reform) and 4.33 (full reform, comparable with advanced economies), and are reported on an annual 
basis in the EBRD Transition Report. A detailed description of the EBRD Transition Indicators is 
provided in Table 5 in Appendix B, along with the other data sources used in this paper. The EBRD Transition Indicators form the basis for the design of two composite indicators, 
which are used to measure overall progress in transition (reform level), and capture changes in the 
distribution of individual reform indicators (reform complementarity). Following Braga de Macedo, 
Oliveira Martins and Rocha (2010), the reform level (RL) is measured as the simple average of the 
nine areas of structural reform, and reform complementarity (RC) is calculated by taking the standard 
deviation of the nine indicators. When the scores for the individual reform indicators are equal, the 
standard deviation is zero and reform complementarities are at their highest. Complementarity measures the level of dispersion across the existing policy framework, and is 
therefore independent of the overall level of reform. In the beginning of transition, the policy 
environment in most countries was both highly distorted and highly complementary. Price controls, 
subsidies, an oversized state sector, a repressed private sector and strict controls on trade and foreign 
exchange all formed part of a self-sustaining (albeit highly precarious) system. In this context, a radial 
reform strategy involving a simultaneous reduction of all distortions is the most desirable approach, as 
it ensures that complementarity levels are maintained at a maximum throughout the transition process. 
However, this method is typically unfeasible due to informational and institutional limitations, and 
governments often had to allow complementarity to decrease as they implemented reforms in 
succession. The transition to a market economy was often a bumpy ride, as a fall in complementarity would 
necessarily entail the exposure of an economy to negative second-best effects. This result is clearly 
visible in Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate the structural evolution of transition for a selected set of 
economies in CEE and the FSU (the remaining country graphs are presented in Figures 14 and 15 in 
Appendix A). The large variability in policy packages and growth performance across countries provides a 
useful platform for the investigation of complementarities among various reforms. Successful 
countries were able to capitalise on the linkages and interdependencies between reforms and generate 
concurrent increases in RL and RC. The U-shaped transition is clearly visible in many of the 
successful CEE countries, including Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. In stark contrast, a 
number of the FSU countries appear to be stuck in a low equilibrium reform trap, including Belarus, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Reforms also appear to have slowed or backtracked in the energy 
exporting economies of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia. The findings are provocative, and suggest 
that more attention ought to be given to reform complementarities in empirical studies on growth in 
transition economies. 11.

analysis to quantify the importance of reforms in the transition process. Studies have invariably tested 
for the weight of initial conditions and structural reforms in determining economic growth rates. At the 
same time, numerous criticisms of aggregate cross country growth regressions have been raised. 
Typically, concerns relate to the arbitrary choice of policy variables, the omission of variables 
capturing differences in institutional quality, the assumptions underlying growth models and the 
inability of reform indicators to predict changes in economic performance (World Bank, 2005). The 
quality of GDP and inflation data has also been called into question, due to systematic over-reporting 
of output during the pre-transition period, under-reporting of growth in the early years of transition 
and the inability to account for a marked increase in informal sector activity (Campos and Coricelli, 
2002). 12 Notwithstanding these important caveats, this section attempts to capture the impact of reforms 
and complementarity on growth in transition economies. Figures 5 and 6 provide an initial view of the 
data for the period 1989 to 1996. A U-shaped relationship is clearly observable between í µí±í µí°¿ and 
í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ in Figure 5, confirming the hypothesis that initial policy improvements in the early stages of transition led to reduced welfare, but further commitment to reform thereafter was positively 
associated with growth. A positive relationship can also be seen in the relationship between 
í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ and changes in complementarity (Figure 6), providing strong support for the inclusion of this variable in the empirical model. 12. 
Estimates of the share of the informal economy during transition range between 6 and 60 percent 
(World Bank, 2002). 18 Figure 5. GDP growth and reform level (RL), 1989-1996 Figure 6. GDP growth and changes in reform complementarity (∆RC), 1989-1996 Note: RC (the x-axis) is measured in reverse because an increase in the standard deviation corresponds to a fall in the level of

− í µí»½ 5 (−í µí±í µí° ¶) − í µí»½ 6 (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) + í µí¼ (2) Equation (2) assumes that í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ is a function of country-specific initial conditions, the 
rate of inflation, and the level and variation of the reform level (í µí±í µí°¿) and reform complementarity (í µí±í µí° ¶) 
indicators. The econometric tests are conducted with an unbalanced panel covering 30 countries and 
24 years (1989 to 2012). 13 The results of the panel regressions are reported in Table 1, and are broadly 
consistent with the results reported in Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins (2008). Several models 
are tested, including one-way fixed effects, GLS random effects and a two-way fixed effects model 
with time dummies. The estimated coefficients are robust and do not vary significantly across the 
various models. Table 1. Initial empirical tests for GDP growth, reform level and complementarity Dependent variable:

34.5 Note: Country fixed effects are not reported. The two-way fixed effects model includes time dummies, which are not reported 
here. The negative of RC and ∆RC are reported in the table, so that a positive change in reform complementarity (i.e. a 
decrease in the standard deviation) corresponds to an increase in real GDP growth (and vice-versa). Asterisks (*) denote 
significance at the 10 percent level (*), 5 percent level (**) and 1 percent level (***). 13. 
See Table 4 in Appendix B for a detailed list of the countries covered in this paper. Some data points 
were removed from the sample, because they contained excessively high values of GDP growth or 
inflation. These include Bosnia (1992 to 1996) and Georgia in 1994. Their removal has no noticeable 
impact on the results. 20 Three important methodological differences are worth noting at this point. First, and foremost, the 
measure of reform complementarity adopted here is the standard deviation (and not the inverse of the 
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is used in Braga de Macedo and Oliveira Martins, 2008). 
The standard deviation is preferred as it produced more favourable results in the estimations, and 
responds to incremental changes in reform indicators in a consistent manner. 14 Second, the inflation 
variable is calculated using the logarithmic transformation log (100 + í µí°¼í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±), which allows for 
some smoothing of the hyperinflation episodes that took place during the early 1990s (Staehr, 2005). 
This increases the explanatory power of the model and results in a substantially higher magnitude for 
the estimated coefficient of the inflation variable. 15 And third, initial conditions are measured as the 
log of 1989 GDP per capita (in constant 2005 US dollars). This variable could only be included in the 
GLS random effects model, as the fixed effects model does not allow for the inclusion of time-
invariant variables. 
Curiously, an improvement in initial conditions appears to have a negative influence on GDP 
growth. One possible explanation is that many of the countries that entered the transition with poor 
initial conditions in the early 1990s have sustained unusually high growth rates in recent years as a 
result of natural resource exports. Indeed, the bottom ten countries in terms of 1989 GDP per capita 
include Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Starting from a lower base also meant 
that these countries were able to achieve rapid growth as income levels in the FSU recovered from the 
transition recession. The results also indicate that a higher overall level of reform (í µí±í µí°¿) is associated with higher 
growth, confirming the importance of sustaining momentum in reforms. However, the coefficient on 
the change in reform level (Δí µí±í µí°¿) variable is negative. This reflects the theory of the second-best: 
governments are often unable to implement broad-based reforms and must resort to a piecemeal 
approach, which typically causes welfare losses in the short-run. On the other hand, the reform complementarity (−í µí±í µí° ¶) variable has a negative coefficient. This 
means that high levels of complementarity (which occur when the standard deviation is low) are 
associated with negative movements in output. The result should not come as a surprise, as many 
unreformed and distorted economies exhibited high levels of complementarity during the early stages 
of transition. The more interesting result in the context of this paper is the change in reform 
complementarity (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) variable, which displays a positive coefficient. Hence an increase in 
complementarity (which corresponds to a decrease in the standard deviation) generates a positive 
output response. This confirms the hypothesis that increases in reform complementarity have a 
positive effect on growth. In spite of the difficulties associated with defining meaningful policy indicators that effectively 
capture the impact of economic and institutional reforms, the results of the initial empirical tests are 
encouraging. The fixed and random effects models explain approximately 50 percent of the time-
variant effects of policy reforms on output. Both the average level of reform and changes in reform 
complementarity are positively associated with growth, suggesting that countries should prioritise 
reforms that have a positive impact on complementarity, while aspiring to a high overall level of 
reform in the long run. 14. 
See Appendix C for a detailed explanation of why the standard deviation is preferred over the inverse 
of the HHI. 15. 
Testing for inflation (without the logarithmic transformation) resulted in a coefficient of -0.0044 for 
the first two models in Table 1. It also led to a substantially lower R-squared coefficient: 0.44 in the 
fixed effects model and 0.46 in the random effects model. 21 Having established the robustness of the estimations reported in Table 1, a second set of 
empirical tests were conducted to control for other relevant determinants of growth. The econometric 
specification is therefore extended as follows: 
í µí°ºí µí°·í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¤í µí±¡ℎ = í µí»¼ + í µí»½ 1 ln(100 + í µí°¼í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±í µí±¡í µí±í µí±í µí±) + í µí»½ 2 í µí±í µí°¿ + í µí»½ 3 ∆í µí±í µí°¿ − í µí»½ 4 (−í µí±í µí° ¶) − í µí»½ 5 (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) − í µí»½ 6 [−∆í µí±í µí° ¶(−1)] − í µí»½ 7 [−∆í µí±í µí° ¶(−2)] + �(í µí»¾ í µí± Ζ í µí± ) í µí± + í µí¼ (3) Equation (3) seeks to substantiate two important hypotheses. First, the model suggests that a 
change in the reform complementarity indicator has an impact on growth over time, beyond the 
contemporaneous effect that has already been tested. This assumption is embodied in the two lagged 
terms Δí µí±í µí° ¶(−1) and Δí µí±í µí° ¶(−2). Second, the specification seeks to test for the impact of a series of 
control variables, represented by the summation term ∑ (í µí»¾ í µí± Ζ í µí± ) í µí± . Data for the control variables are 
obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. Table 2 compares the results of five panel estimations. The initial conditions variable is excluded, 
because the models are an extension of the one-way fixed effects regression reported in the first 
column of Table 1 (the random effects model was rejected by the Hausman test). In order to test for 
the robustness of the estimated coefficients, columns 3, 4 and 5 experiment with various alternative 
combinations of the explanatory variables. A comparison reveals that the coefficients are relatively 
stable and the results do not lose significance when explanatory variables are removed from the model. The first point worth noting is that the augmented model does not substantially alter the sign, 
magnitude or statistical significance of the initial set of variables. A high reform level (í µí±í µí°¿) and an 
increase in reform complementarity (–Δí µí±í µí° ¶) are still positively correlated with growth, and all of the 
original explanatory variables remain significant at either 1 or 5 percent. Second, the lagged coefficients of (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) are also statistically significant, confirming the 
assumption that an improvement in complementarity influences growth beyond the short-term 
contemporaneous effect. 16 Moreover, the effects over time are non-trivial: in the first two estimations 
(models (1) and (2) in Table 2), the combined magnitude of the lagged coefficients of (−Δí µí±í µí° ¶) 
exceeds the coefficient for the contemporaneous impact. Turning to the estimated coefficients for the control variables, a number of interesting findings 
emerge. Increases in government expenditure are negatively associated with growth, suggesting that 
transition economies are overburdened by bureaucracy and public sector inefficiencies. Conversely, an 
increase in FDI inflows leads to higher growth. Attracting FDI has been the hallmark of successful 
transition economies in recent years, and could be an important policy focus for countries seeking to 
increase their orientation to external markets. The inclusion of the secondary school enrolment variable is motivated by the fact that growth 
regressions for transition economies often neglect to incorporate measures of human capital 
accumulation (Staehr, 2005). As expected, the results demonstrate that higher levels of human capital 
lead to higher growth. Oil rents are also positively correlated with growth, reflecting the substantial 
growth stimulus that has occurred over the past decade as a result of increased oil production in 
countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia. 16. 
Changes in the average reform level (∆RL) also impact growth (negatively) over time, however due to 
multicollinearity the ∆RL(-1) and ∆RC(-1) variables lose significance when included in the model 
together. 22 Curiously, a higher degree of urbanisation seems to reduce growth. This may be due to the 
importance of rural and regional economic systems in contributing to the growth process in transition 
economies. Alternatively, it could be a reflection of natural resource abundance in countries with large 
territories and low levels of urbanisation. Finally, the structure of output also has a substantial influence on growth. An increase in the 
share of agriculture and industry in GDP engenders a positive growth response, and an increase in the 
share of services in GDP is negatively associated with growth. This result should not be immediately 
interpreted as a justification for greater industrialisation and the development of agriculture in 
transition economies, as it mostly reflects the large transformation in the structure of output 
experienced during the transition recession. 17 17.

output in CEE and the FSU. 23 Table 2. Fixed effects panel regressions with additional control variables Dependent variable:

interesting case study for the theory of reform complementarities. The economy sustained a sharp 
output decline during the early years of transition, and did not regain its 1989 level of real GDP per 
capita until 2003. An aggressive stance on internal and external liberalisation may have initially 
exacerbated the effects of the recession; however the reforms eventually precipitated substantial FDI 
inflows in the extractive industries. The country has enjoyed high growth rates and rising prosperity 
over the past decade, primarily driven by the production of mineral and fossil fuel resources. In spite of this progress, income per capita growth has been highly volatile, and the economy 
remains considerably exposed to external shocks. Figure 7 depicts sharp fluctuations in Kazakhstan's 
GDP per capita growth rate, which closely follows growth rates in the FSU. In particular, the country 
was severely affected by the 1998 Russian crisis, a local banking crisis in 2008, and the 2009 global 
economic downturn. Recent efforts to stabilise the economy have provided some relief, however 
banking sector weaknesses persist and commodity price instability continues to generate strong 
inflationary pressures (IMF, 2012). Figure 7. Real GDP per capita growth in Kazakhstan, 1989-2012 Note: Regional aggregates are population-weighted. Source: Author's calculations, based on data from WB/WDI. Similar to other countries in the FSU, the transition recession led to a marked shift in the 
structural composition of output in Kazakhstan. Figure 16 in Appendix A illustrates the sharp decline 
in the share of agriculture and industry in GDP, which fell from a combined level of 71 percent in 
1992 (27 percent for agriculture and 45 percent for industry) to 43 percent in 2012 (4 percent for 
agriculture and 39 percent for industry). To a certain extent, the depth of Kazakhstan's output collapse 
at the beginning of transition can be attributed to relatively higher levels of initial industrialisation and 
a strong exposure to competitive pressures from the Russian market. -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 GDP growth (annual %) Kazakhstan 
Former Soviet Union 25 Kazakhstan's transition was marked by radical reforms in the early 1990s, particularly in the 
areas of price liberalisation, small-scale privatisation, trade openness and the foreign exchange system. 
As the last country to formally declare independence from the Soviet Union, economic and social ties 
with Russia had a strong influence on the choice of policy reforms in Kazakhstan (Hoen and 
Irnazarov, 2012). For instance, the liberalisation of domestic prices in January 1992 took place in 
parallel to the removal of price controls in Russia. By the end of 1994, full price liberalisation was 
virtually complete, with more than 90 percent of prices free of administrative controls (EBRD, 1994). 
The privatisation process was also strongly influenced by Russian reforms, with the adoption of a 
voucher-based programme in 1994. By 1996, 60 percent of the 1,700 enterprises designated for large-
scale privatisation and 70 percent of the 16,000 entities earmarked for small-scale privatisation had 
been transferred into private ownership (EBRD, 1996). Complementarities were central to the transition process in Kazakhstan, particularly between 
liberalisation and privatisation reforms. Privatisation improved the incentives for profit generation, 
and the removal of price controls and subsidies ensured that resources were allocated more efficiently 
within the economy. Privatisation also facilitated the process of macroeconomic stabilisation. Driven 
by the sale of large oil concessions in the late 1990s, Kazakhstan's privatisation proceeds as a share of 
GDP were the highest out of all transition economies. This additional source of budgetary revenue 
substantially improved the fiscal adjustment process in Kazakhstan. An aggressive monetary stance 
also helped to reduce inflation to manageable levels, creating favourable conditions for investment and 
private sector activity (Alam and Banerji, 2000). Kazakhstan also implemented significant reforms to liberalise trade and the foreign exchange 
system. A convertible national currency with a single unified exchange rate was introduced in 
November 1993, and most export and import quotas and licensing requirements were abolished by 
1995 (EBRD, 1996). These reforms have been instrumental in encouraging domestic firms to increase 
productivity in the face of strong competitive pressures from international markets. More recently, the 
establishment of a Customs Union between Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia in January 2010 has 
further increased Kazakhstan's exposure to foreign competition, particularly the Russian market (IMF, 
2011). Figure 8 depicts progress in the implementation of major structural reforms in Kazakhstan 
between 1995 and 2012. While  " shock therapy "  has led to extensive improvements in the domains of 
privatisation, price liberalisation and trade policy, several crucial areas remain only partially reformed. 
In particular, competition policy and governance and enterprise restructuring only score 2 out of a 
maximum possible score of 4.33. These areas have remained largely unreformed for the past two 
decades. 26 Figure 8. Progress in structural reforms in Kazakhstan, 1995-2012 Note: Scores range between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.33. See Table 5 in Appendix B for a detailed definition of the 
EBRD Transition Indicators. Source: EBRD Transition Report (1995; 2000; 2012) Kazakhstan needs to confront two important challenges in order to sustain economic growth and 
foster the development of a competitive private sector. First, the government should reduce state 
interference in the economy by restructuring large and unprofitable enterprises, and strengthening the 
corporate governance of SOEs. Second, the development of a competitive business environment is 
crucial to encourage private sector development. Improving the legal and institutional framework for 
competition policy can facilitate the entry of new enterprises and reduce the abuse of market power by 
monopolies and conglomerates. Enterprise restructuring is a central part of the transition process, as it reduces the economic 
burden of inefficient industries and provides new firms with a valuable source of assets and labour. 
Imposing market discipline on SOEs improves corporate governance, creates incentives for 
restructuring and increases productivity. Conversely, weak corporate governance and inefficient 
resource transfers to SOEs ultimately results in corruption, rent-seeking and the discouragement of 
private sector activity. Kazakhstan has made limited progress in this area, with no significant reforms 
to governance and enterprise restructuring since 1996. Economic growth stems from the creation and growth of new enterprises, which are subject to a 
level playing field and proper incentives for wealth creation. In this regard, an effective competition 
policy is essential as it prevents large monopolies and conglomerates from restricting new entrants 
from competing in the market. This provides new enterprises with the incentives to absorb the 
resources of old firms, undertake new investments and sustain high growth and employment levels 
(World Bank, 2002). Therefore, there is strong evidence of a symbiotic relationship between enterprise 
restructuring and competition policy. Comprehensive reforms to both areas are likely to induce 
significant benefits in terms of economic performance. In addition, there are considerable complementarities between enterprise restructuring, 
competition policy and trade liberalisation. Free trade exposes domestic firms to international 1 2 3 4 Large-scale privatisation Small-scale privatisation Governance and enterprise

However, competition policy in Kazakhstan has not improved since June 1994, when a new anti-
monopoly law was introduced (EBRD, 1995). Amendments to the legislation were introduced in June 
2012 in an attempt to limit the prevalence of state monopolies, however in practice no concrete 
progress has been made in reducing the role of the state in the economy (EBRD, 2012). This suggests 
there are substantial benefits to be reaped from reforms to the complementary areas of governance and 
enterprise restructuring, competition policy, and trade liberalisation. The hypothesis that comprehensive reforms to enterprise restructuring, competition policy and 
trade liberalisation will have a positive impact on economic growth in Kazakhstan can be tested by 
means of a predictive scenario analysis. Figure 9 illustrates three potential reform scenarios for 
Kazakhstan. The first case is a  " no reform "  scenario, with no changes to the current institutional 
framework. The second case is a  " comprehensive reform "  scenario, involving the complete removal of 
all distortions in the areas of governance and enterprise restructuring, competition policy and the trade 
and foreign exchange system. This corresponds to an increase to 4.33 (the maximum possible score) 
for the EBRD Transition Indicators in these respective areas. The third  " partial reform "  scenario 
signifies a partial increase (from 2 to 3) in the score for the governance and enterprise restructuring 
indicator. Figure 9. Comparing potential reform scenarios for Kazakhstan Note: Scores range between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.33. See Table 5 in Appendix B for a detailed definition of the 
EBRD Transition Indicators. Figure 10 illustrates the results of the predictive scenario analysis, which calculates GDP growth 
forecasts for Kazakhstan based on the coefficients estimated in regression model (1) in Table 2. The 
results indicate that ceteris paribus, comprehensive reforms to enterprise restructuring, competition 
policy and trade liberalisation will have a positive impact on GDP growth. The reforms initially induce 
a negative second-best result; however this loss is compensated for by higher growth rates in 
subsequent years. On the other hand, the partial reform scenario results in a strong negative impact on 
output growth. This reflects the fact that partial reforms in transition economies have often left 
countries mired in a low equilibrium level of reform. It seems that complementarities are of cardinal 
significance in the quest for growth, and neglecting to take them into account can have dire 
consequences for a country's welfare and prosperity. 1 2 3 4 Large-scale privatisation Small-scale privatisation Governance and enterprise

reach a consensus on the elements needed to generate sustainable growth in the context of transition. 
To be sure, differing initial conditions, economic shocks and a susceptibility to adverse second-best 
outcomes have all served to obfuscate the relationship between policy reforms and growth 
performance. Nevertheless, this paper attempts to derive a number of decisive lessons that can be used 
to inform the design of transition strategies. The central conclusion that emerges from this study is that countries in transition should aim to 
maximise complementarity within the existing policy framework. Using complementarities as a basis 
for the prioritisation of reforms is comparable to an approach based on targeting the  " binding 
constraints "  to growth, and is the strategy most predisposed to be welfare enhancing. To substantiate this theory, empirical tests are conducted for 30 transition economies over the 
period 1989 to 2012, relating output growth to indicators of the level and complementarity of reforms. 
Composite indicators are calculated using nine key measures of structural reform, taken from the 
EBRD Transition Indicators database: large-scale privatisation, small-scale privatisation, governance 
and enterprise restructuring, price liberalisation, trade and the foreign exchange system, competition 
policy, banking reform and interest rate liberalisation, securities markets and non-bank financial 
institutions, and infrastructure. 18 The reform level indicator is measured as the simple average of the 18.

No reform 
Comprehensive reform 
Partial reform 29 individual areas of structural reform, and reform complementarity is calculated by taking the standard 
deviation of the nine indicators. The panel data estimations demonstrate that the reform level (í µí±í µí°¿) and 
change in reform complementarity (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) variables are both positively associated with GDP growth. 
Furthermore, the results are robust to the addition of numerous control variables, including a measure 
of initial conditions (proxied by the log of 1989 GDP per capita), macroeconomic stabilisation 
(proxied by the log of inflation), and other indicators commonly incorporated in growth regressions 
such as government expenditure, net FDI inflows and secondary school enrolment. The estimation of lagged coefficients for the change in reform complementarity variable (−∆í µí±í µí° ¶) 
is a novel feature of the analysis presented in this paper. The results illustrate that a change in reform 
complementarity has a significant influence on real GDP growth over time, highlighting the 
importance of controlling for the dynamic impact of reforms in growth regressions. The use of the 
regression model coefficients to generate growth forecasts is also a unique feature of this study. The 
findings suggest that Kazakhstan should implement comprehensive reforms to a targeted group of 
complementary policies in order to generate growth. A partial reform strategy, on the other hand, is 
likely to have an unfavourable impact on welfare. This research paper is by no means exhaustive and a number of potential avenues remain open for 
further research. For instance, it is widely recognised that policies are endogenous to growth, and the 
feasible set of policies in one time period may depend on the nature of previous policy decisions 
(World Bank, 2002). Controlling for endogeneity is therefore essential to correct for the possibility of 
bias in the panel estimations. Another possible area to be explored is the calculation process for the 
composite indicators of reform level and reform complementarity, which implicitly consider all 
policies to be of equal importance and influence to the growth process. This assumption can be relaxed 
through the introduction of a weighting scheme for the individual reform indicators. Finally, this paper has focused on a specific package of structural reforms, leaving a number of 
important institutional reforms absent from the analysis. Rodrik (2005) argues that high-quality 
institutional arrangements are central to the transition process, as they imbue an economy with the 
resilience to withstand economic shocks and the ability to boost  " productive dynamism " . Sustaining 
growth in the long-term therefore requires sound and sophisticated institutions. Further research can 
include measures of more complex institutional changes, such as reforms to the legal framework, 
judicial system and tax administration. 30 APPENDIX A: SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES Figure 11. Evolution of real GDP per capita growth rates, 1989-2012 Note: Regional aggregates are population-weighted.

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) as a measure of reform complementarity. However, in a 
subsequent paper, Braga de Macedo, Oliveira Martins and Rocha (2010) measure complementarities 
(or  " policy dispersion " ) using the standard deviation instead. This paper advocates the use of the standard deviation as a measure of complementarity, as it is 
more consistent in representing changes in the distribution of individual reform indicators. This can be 
illustrated by means of a simple example: suppose an economic system can be characterised by three 
reform indicators (e.g. stabilisation, liberalisation and privatisation), and that each indicator is 
allocated a score from 1 to 4. Table 6 outlines five different scenarios, each corresponding to different 
levels in the individual reform indicators. According to Table 6, the standard deviation considers the level of complementarity to be equal 
in scenarios 2 and 4. Therefore, a move from (1,1,1) to (1,2,1) is considered to have the same impact 
on complementarity as a move from (2,2,2) to (2,3,2). On the other hand, the inverse of the HHI 
computes equal levels of complementarity for scenarios 2 and 5. Hence a move from (1,1,1) to (1,2,1) 
is interpreted as equivalent (in terms of the change in the complementarity index) to a move from 
(2,2,2) to (2,4,2). It seems the standard deviation is a more realistic choice, as it interprets reform 
indicators in the way they are intended: a linear shift in a country's score from 1 to 2 is roughly 
equivalent to a move from 2 to 3. Table 6. Calculations of reform complementarity Scenario
