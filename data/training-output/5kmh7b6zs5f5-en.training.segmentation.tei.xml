			<body>INTERNATIONAL MOBILE ROAMING SERVICES: ANALYSIS AND POLICY <lb/>RECOMMENDATIONS <lb/>MAIN POINTS <lb/>The first report on international mobile roaming services ( &quot; International Mobile Roaming Charging in <lb/>the OECD Area &quot; , DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)8/FINAL 1 ), provided information on market development and <lb/>pricing of International Mobile Roaming Services (IMRS) in the OECD area. It found prices to be <lb/>unreasonably high, considering the underlying costs, and identified some of the causes for high roaming <lb/>prices. High wholesale charges, the fact that consumers do not seem to take into account roaming services <lb/>when choosing a bundled mobile offer, lack of contestability and low consumer awareness of roaming <lb/>prices and of substitutes were found to be among the reasons for this price level. This report is a follow-up <lb/>that proposes solutions to the described problems, and assesses their viability and possible side effects. <lb/>The development of on-net offers by operators with large footprints is a desirable market-driven <lb/>solution to the problem of high wholesale roaming charges. This response was referred to as <lb/> &quot; internalisation &quot; in the first roaming report. Although trans-national footprints are needed in order to avoid <lb/>wholesale charges, on-net offers based on the internalisation of wholesale costs and traffic steering to <lb/>subsidiaries are a natural solution to launch reasonably priced and convenient retail roaming offers. <lb/>However, the number of operators with large footprints remains low, and some on-net offers are likely to <lb/>be focused on roaming in a particular region (e.g. Zain in East Africa). Due to competition dynamics at the <lb/>retail level and the fact that roaming services are an element of the mobile services bundle, trans-national <lb/>operators are likely to decide not to lower retail prices in order to retain high revenues from non price-<lb/>elastic customers. <lb/>In the event of a marketplace dominated by few operators with large footprints, smaller operators may <lb/>be put aside, due to their inability to internalise wholesale roaming costs. Bigger players may impose high <lb/>wholesale charges and make them unable to launch competitive retail roaming offers. The natural response <lb/>for smaller operators is to form alliances in order to get substantial wholesale rate reductions. Although <lb/>such alliances have existed for some time and did not prove to be very successful in bringing down overall <lb/>wholesale costs, they may be again a valid response in a new scenario with increased operator <lb/>consolidation and the presence of a higher number of on-net offers. As a last resort, regulatory intervention <lb/>may be warranted to allow for improved market contestability. <lb/>Another way forward to improve market contestability in roaming services was termed &quot; localisation &quot; <lb/>in the first report. Global Mobile Virtual Network Operators (global MVNOs) are those operators that gain <lb/>access to local airtime on local terms and conditions, thus avoiding wholesale roaming rates. Even though <lb/>a number of global MVNOs have entered the market during the last few years, this option still remains not <lb/>very widespread. It faces some important drawbacks, such as customers being reluctant to have two mobile <lb/>service providers, lack of brand recognition, etc. They also face serious challenges to expand their <lb/>customer base such as low bargaining power compared to &quot; national &quot; MVNOs, and relatively low volumes <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>to justify investments. However, global MVNOs remain as an alternative to provide better market <lb/>contestability and this report supports enhancing their visibility and consumer awareness. National <lb/>regulatory frameworks as well should enable global MVNOs to develop by allowing access to airtime on <lb/>local terms and conditions. <lb/>The World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework could also be used to provide a cross-country legal <lb/>framework for roaming services. Roaming services are arguably covered by the General Agreement on <lb/>Trade in Services (GATS), since they are important for access to and use of public communications. It is <lb/>not explicitly mentioned whether wholesale roaming providers can be declared major suppliers of an <lb/>essential facility, according to the WTO Reference Paper. This report finds a way forward regarding <lb/>roaming services in the current WTO provisions, which would mean initiating a MFN ( &quot; most favoured <lb/>nation &quot; ) dispute settlement procedure against a country to make their existing wholesale roaming <lb/>conditions (national or international) available to operators from any other WTO member. These <lb/>conditions may not necessarily be the same for every operator, and may vary depending on volumes, <lb/>distance, etc. A second way forward would be using the WTO framework and the evidence of applicability <lb/>to encourage NRAs regulate wholesale roaming services, in that visited network providers offer just, <lb/>reasonable and non-discriminatory rates to home operators. <lb/>Publication of Inter-Operator Tariffs (IOTs) and negotiated wholesale rates would bring them to <lb/>public record, enabling consumers to separate wholesale charges and retail margin in their roaming bills. <lb/>While publication of IOTs should be encouraged, as they are widely known by the industry and do not <lb/>represent the final outcome of wholesale negotiations (but only a cap for wholesale roaming rates), <lb/>imposing the publication of the outcome of these negotiations would face strong commercial <lb/>confidentiality and regulatory concerns, such as providing a price point for collusion leading to higher <lb/>prices. Instead, this report advocates that data collections be conducted by NRAs in order to produce a <lb/>benchmark to inform regulatory policy without explicitly publishing wholesale rates of individual <lb/>operators. This publication would address the need for public scrutiny of wholesale rates while preserving <lb/>commercial confidentiality and avoiding regulatory concerns. <lb/>This report acknowledges that directly regulating roaming prices may be the only way to guarantee <lb/>that consumers are not unreasonably charged. The aim of this intervention should be to protect consumers <lb/>and remove international barriers for trade and travel. Whether regulating retail roaming prices should <lb/>address internal market concerns will depend on regional provisions, such as the European Union&apos;s (EU) <lb/>internal market rationale for regulating IMRS. Under the traditional approach, regulation is first introduced <lb/>at the wholesale level to tackle any bottlenecks to competition and the underlying causes for high retail <lb/>prices. Then if it is clear that, due to a lack of retail competition, the benefits of wholesale regulation will <lb/>not be passed through to the retail level, retail price regulation may be warranted to ensure that consumers <lb/>benefit. On the other hand, it has also been argued that, if the concern is consumer protection and removal <lb/>of barriers for trade and travel, the intervention may be restricted to retail prices. However, this may make <lb/>smaller operators have their margins squeezed, which may warrant a consistent wholesale regulation as <lb/>well. If the aim is to promote competition, that may serve to justify wholesale intervention. The dynamics <lb/>between wholesale and retail level should be carefully analysed and co–ordinated with other measures to <lb/>improve competition in the roaming market. As the EU experience proves, wholesale rates reductions are <lb/>not necessarily passed on to consumers. <lb/>Since some National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and policy makers would request reciprocity <lb/>from their counterparts if a price regulation is to be enforced, the best way forward to regulate wholesale <lb/>roaming prices internationally would be to have a mutual agreement between two or more countries to <lb/>regulate wholesale and/or retail prices. Those do not necessarily have to be identical and should be based <lb/>on established criteria. Thus, operators from both countries would be subject to comparable wholesale <lb/>price regulations that guarantee that operators do not charge each other unreasonable wholesale prices, and <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>that operators do not charge their customers unreasonable retail prices. A multilateral approach, that is, <lb/>having a framework agreement to which countries could adhere, may be less resource demanding than <lb/>multiple bi-lateral agreements in terms of the effort required for agreeing on it, although it will need to <lb/>gather agreement from many countries. However, in the event that two countries reach and implement a <lb/>roaming agreement this may serve as an example, add momentum and trigger further developments, <lb/>eventually making additional countries join. <lb/>Again, if the objective is to protect consumers, it may not be appropriate to impose cost-oriented <lb/>prices. Different considerations may be taken into account if the aim of the intervention is to improve <lb/>competition dynamics. As to establishing an adequate price cap for retail and wholesale roaming services, <lb/>a top-down approach is preferred, since it would consider roaming charges in light of equivalent domestic <lb/>services plus roaming-specific costs, allowing for a much simpler approach when setting a regulated price <lb/>cap. <lb/>Some Alternative Calling Procedures (ACPs) for roaming have been identified, as well as other <lb/>alternatives such as SMS or e–mails. Even though some of them are becoming increasingly seamless, they <lb/>still fail to be perfect roaming substitutes. Their main drawbacks are the loss of incoming calls to the <lb/>customer&apos;s usual number, lack of mobility (hotel phones, payphones, international calling cards), language <lb/>barriers (purchasing a local SIM-card), technical and commercial constraints (mobile or fixed VoIP calls, <lb/>etc.). Even though ACPs are not likely to become a widespread alternative to roaming, their use should be <lb/>promoted and consumers should be more aware of them in order to make an informed choice. <lb/>Temporary Number Portability (TNP) has been proposed by the Australian Parliament as a measure to <lb/>decouple the mobile services bundle which may allow consumers to switch mobile provider only for <lb/>roaming services. Although this may entail an extra cost that has to be assessed and may not be in line with <lb/>the operators&apos; business models, it is a possibility that should be assessed by means of a cost-benefit <lb/>analysis. In many OECD countries, NP only takes a few days and the procedure may be extended to TNP. <lb/>It is up to NRAs and policy makers to assess whether TNP fits into the existing regulatory framework and <lb/>commercial practice. <lb/>This report strongly supports the implementation of transparency measures that increase consumer <lb/>awareness of retail roaming charges. Operators should inform consumers of roaming charges by means of <lb/>SMS, websites and/or personalised information. Consumers should be given clear instructions so as to <lb/>avoid bill-shock or guarantee their awareness of roaming charges. <lb/>Accordingly, any measures promoting awareness of the (imperfect) substitutes for roaming are <lb/>strongly advocated. Consumers should be provided with comprehensive information about the availability <lb/>of substitutes, main drawbacks and advantages, so that they are able to make an informed choice as to their <lb/>willingness to use roaming services. NRAs and policy makers should launch information campaigns and <lb/>websites that reflect existing commercial alternatives for roaming services. <lb/>A possible side effect of roaming price regulation is &quot; water-bedding &quot; effects, in that operators may <lb/>want to recoup the lost revenues by increasing the price of domestic services. While the economic theory <lb/>recognises their existence, and that they are stronger the more intense the competition is, empirical <lb/>evidence is usually difficult to obtain. There are other factors that may prevent the price of domestic <lb/>mobile services to rise, such as economic, commercial and technological trends, of which it is very difficult <lb/>to establish a causal link. The fact that the share of revenues coming from roaming services is generally a <lb/>small fraction of total mobile revenues makes the impact of any waterbed effects likely to be limited. This <lb/>effect, however, should be taken into account when assessing the impact of roaming price regulation as it <lb/>may be stronger for some types of operators. Any foreseen tariff rebalancing or revenue transfer between <lb/>operators due to price regulations should also be carefully assessed. Another effect of decreasing roaming <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>In the context of work on international mobile roaming services (IMRS), a first report, <lb/>DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)8/FINAL, provided information and analysis on market developments and pricing <lb/>in IMRS. The present report, as a follow-up, aims to examine and suggest possible solutions and policy <lb/>options that may address the problem of high international mobile roaming charges. <lb/>As noted in the first part of the work on mobile roaming there are a number of factors which result in <lb/>high roaming prices: <lb/>񮽙 Consumers do not take into account international roaming charges when choosing a mobile <lb/>service provider. IMRS are sold in a bundle, which includes local calls, access, possible <lb/>handset subsidy, etc. <lb/>񮽙 High wholesale charges are, at least for outgoing communications, the major contributor to <lb/>high retail prices. Although heavy end-users are likely to obtain better prices, they cannot put <lb/>pressure on wholesale charges. <lb/>񮽙 The international mobile roaming market is not a contestable market, i.e. it is not a market <lb/>subject to significant competitive market forces and it is difficult to introduce competition in <lb/>this market. <lb/>񮽙 IMRS charges are not made very transparent to users. <lb/>񮽙 Since there are no close substitutes for IMRS, demand has tended to be price inelastic and, <lb/>consequently, providers have been able to maintain high prices. <lb/>񮽙 Where substitutes exist they are not perfect and the average user is not familiar with them. <lb/>Although alternative calling procedures to IMRS are becoming increasingly seamless, <lb/>knowledge and brand recognition by consumers remain generally low. <lb/>In assessing policy options in order to agree on a set of recommendations on IMRS that may be put in <lb/>place by governments, or be part of a self-regulatory process by mobile operators, there are two ways <lb/>forward which are, to a certain extent, complementary. <lb/>Firstly, policy makers can try to address one of the core problems: high wholesale charges as one <lb/>underlying reason for high prices. This may be done in a number of ways, such as policy makers trying to <lb/>deal with the result of lack of market contestability at the wholesale level, i.e. the high wholesale charges <lb/>themselves, or by means of enforcing policies that bring contestability to the wholesale market without <lb/>regulating wholesale prices. To that aim, fostering the development of large footprints that enable the <lb/>launch of on-net offers, or finding ways to bypass the framework for roaming agreements (IOT framework) <lb/>may bring some contestability to the wholesale market. <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>Secondly, we can consider policies addressing the consumer perspective. In particular, these policies <lb/>should tackle the fact that IMRS are sold in a bundle with domestic mobile services, and that consumers do <lb/>not pay attention to IMRS prices when subscribing to a domestic provider. It is therefore the retail <lb/>dynamics and their relationship to wholesale roaming services that will be addressed in this section. This <lb/>set of policy options includes increasing consumer awareness of IMRS prices, exploring the possibility of <lb/>purchasing roaming services separately (decoupling the bundle), as well as regulating retail charges <lb/>themselves. <lb/>The promotion/emergence of (imperfect) substitutes will also be taken into account, although such <lb/>substitutes are, by their nature, not a part of the roaming market. Thus, the core problem (high roaming <lb/>prices) may not be solved, but it would be mitigated via the use of alternatives to roaming services. <lb/>It is noteworthy that market contestability, as it is used throughout the report, may refer to both <lb/>wholesale or retail markets. As the ITU ICT Regulation Toolkit notes, 2 a market is said to be contestable <lb/>when barriers to entry and exit are so low that the threat of potential entry prevents the incumbent from <lb/>exercising market power. Dynamics of retail and wholesale roaming markets will be approached separately, <lb/>since they are influenced by different factors. <lb/>These two categories of policy options are not mutually exclusive and some of the aspects addressed <lb/>may well fall into more than one. Even though retail regulation addresses the consumer perspective and <lb/>wholesale regulation is meant to tackle high wholesale charges, both have been merged in the same section <lb/>for the sake of clarity, as they are interlinked. This paper will examine the different options which could be <lb/>used to address the core problems. For each one of them, potential impacts will be evaluated, as well as <lb/>implementation challenges and expected results, providing relevant evidence or best practice when <lb/>possible. <lb/></body>

			<body>POLICIES ADDRESSING HIGH WHOLESALE PRICES <lb/>Development of Alliances/On-Net Offers <lb/>The <lb/>report <lb/> &quot; International <lb/>Mobile <lb/>Roaming <lb/>Charging <lb/>in <lb/>the <lb/>OECD <lb/>Area &quot; <lb/>(DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)8/FINAL) provided information and analysis on market developments and pricing <lb/>in IMRS. One of the key factors recognised as having potential to place some pressure on wholesale rates <lb/>for roaming services was termed &quot; Internalisation &quot; . The development of new traffic-steering techniques, <lb/>from 2002 on, allows operators to steer around 80% or more of the roaming voice and SMS traffic to <lb/>preferred networks, selected by the home operator (but less for data roaming traffic). The basic utility of <lb/>this instrument is that roaming traffic is much more predictable and provides home operators with more <lb/>negotiating power against visited networks, since the amount of directed traffic is higher. The outcome of <lb/>these developments was the formation of alliances among mobile operators, whose members were <lb/>expected to pay lower wholesale roaming prices. As pointed out in the first phase of this work, alliances <lb/>have not been successful in radically changing the roaming services market although, together with <lb/>internalisation, they have contributed to lowering wholesale roaming charges. <lb/>Mobile operators with large trans-national footprints have moved to reduce retail prices with the <lb/>launch of &quot; on-net &quot; offers, either purely on-net, in that only the foreign subsidiary&apos;s networks are used for <lb/>roaming, or not purely on-net, where operators manage to negotiate reduced prices for selected visited <lb/>networks, but that were still based on on-net internalisation of roaming wholesale charges. An example of <lb/>the latter is Vodafone Passport that offered roaming services at domestic rates plus a per-call fee. While <lb/>Vodafone Passport is not a merely on-net offer, in that another visited network could be used without an <lb/>extra charge, it is true that it is mainly based on the trans-national footprint of Vodafone, thus mainly by-<lb/>passing wholesale charges. <lb/>Another very representative example of &quot; on-net &quot; offers is Zain. This Kuwaiti-based company has a <lb/>footprint of 16 countries in East Africa and some others in the Middle East. The &quot; One Network &quot; launched <lb/>in 2006, simply eliminates IMRC across African countries within its footprint, and customers just pay the <lb/>applicable national rates. It is also possible for customers to top-up their prepaid accounts in any of these <lb/>countries, and use the remaining credit in any of them. <lb/>Zain&apos;s &quot; One Network &quot; offer has special characteristics that help in understanding why &quot; on-net &quot; offers <lb/>are not more widespread nowadays. The straightforward answer for that is that operators are actually <lb/>making profits out of the current IOT framework, and alliances do not substantially bring roaming charges <lb/>closer to domestic rates. However, Zain&apos;s example is slightly different. Nearly 100% of its customer base <lb/>is pre-paid and its footprint reaches almost exclusively developing countries. As a result, Zain customers&apos; <lb/>willingness to pay IMRC may be very low or almost inexistent, contrary to some customer segments in <lb/>developed countries. That being said, Zain may have no customers from whom to extract high IMRC, since <lb/>its customers would just simply not use roaming services and most likely purchase a local SIM-card. In <lb/>other words, Zain&apos;s customers are likely to be very price-elastic and thus revenue maximisation requires <lb/>low IMRS prices. <lb/>A similar offer addressed to low income customers was launched in the Caribbean. 3 Although Digicel <lb/>offered conventional post-paid roaming services from the outset, in 2004 it began to offer pre-paid roaming. <lb/>It launched Digiroaming, a tariff with simple, low price call charges across all its networks (Aruba, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>Barbados, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). It was initially limited to <lb/>customers in and travelling between these destinations. 4 <lb/>Rather than trying to extract roaming revenues from a customer base with no willingness to pay, Zain <lb/>has chosen IMRS as a tool to ensure customer fidelity, helped by relatively high cross-border mobility in <lb/>some parts of East Africa. 5 It also facilitated cross-border customers belonging to the same family, group <lb/>of friends, etc., communication across countries. Thus, Zain uses its very wide footprint as a commercial <lb/>tool for customer retention, brand improvement and competitive advantage. In fact, some of their <lb/>competitors have started to respond to competition from &quot; One network &quot; , notably MTN, Orange, Tigo and <lb/>Vodafone. 6 <lb/>In other countries, however, the situation has been quite different from that in East Africa. Some <lb/>operators benefit from demand inelasticity and the customer base&apos;s willingness to pay. Operators have so <lb/>far chosen to keep high retail IMRC, which encourage high wholesale charges, and not to try and create <lb/>more elastic demand by a significant reduction of roaming charges. Although some offers such as <lb/>Vodafone Passport have been very successful in the market, they often keep high per-call fees and were <lb/>not launched until the EU put considerable pressure on European operators to lower roaming charges. <lb/>Clearly, &quot; internalisation &quot; is a market-oriented solution to the problem of high IMRC. Operators with <lb/>large footprints may be able to offer advantageous roaming deals overcoming the problem of high <lb/>wholesale charges. However, whether they actually offer them depends on a number of factors that will be <lb/>analysed in depth in the following sections, such as the customers&apos; willingness to pay, price elasticity and <lb/>presence and knowledge of seamless substitutes. <lb/>As an alternative to cost-internalisation by operators with large footprints, smaller operators have the <lb/>option of forming trans-national alliances. Four of them appeared from 2004 to 2006 and one of their aims <lb/>was to increase effectiveness of traffic direction for IMR. However, these alliances did not succeed in <lb/>breaking away from the IOT system and did not offer substantive reductions in roaming charges. Concern <lb/>was expressed by industry analysts that the alliances lacked win-win scenarios necessary for success. 7 <lb/>The market-oriented &quot; internalisation &quot; solution to high roaming charges has sometimes not been <lb/>considered by public authorities in carrying out competition law enforcement. They feared the impact on <lb/>overall mobile market competition of footprints that are too large and the ability to launch seamless <lb/>international calling plans that may harm smaller operators. In fact, (in its merger with Mannesmann 8 ) <lb/>Vodafone committed to allow other operators reasonable margins both at the inter-operator and at the retail <lb/>level, in order to prevent margin squeezes on other competitors. While this could have theoretically <lb/>prevented Vodafone from eliminating roaming charges completely, it still gave Vodafone the possibility to <lb/>reduce roaming charges significantly, i.e. to the level where a reasonably efficient competing operator <lb/>could make a reasonable return. However, this did not happen as a consequence of the merger and, most <lb/>likely because of the relatively low competitive pressure in the roaming market, there would have been <lb/>little incentive for Vodafone to actually eliminate or lower roaming charges. <lb/>Another interpretation may point out that Vodafone was discouraged from reducing wholesale <lb/>roaming charges due to its commitments (in particular, to allow other operators reasonable margins), that <lb/>may have enabled competitors to replicate its offers. According to the EC&apos;s reasoning, competitors would <lb/>be unable to replicate the new entity&apos;s network and would have to rely on roaming agreements with <lb/>Vodafone in order to offer &quot; equivalent &quot; pan-European services. There was a perception that the merger <lb/>would lead to a dominant position in the emerging pan-European market for internationally mobile <lb/>customers because customers of other operators would generally prefer the merged entity to other mobile <lb/>operators given its large footprint across European countries. <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>In order to address these concerns, Vodafone submitted some undertakings, which cover exclusive <lb/>roaming agreements, third parties&apos; access to roaming agreements, standards and SIM-cards and a set of <lb/>implementing measures aimed at ensuring their effectiveness. In particular, the provision of a roaming <lb/>tariff and/or wholesale services would be made on a non-discriminatory basis between operators of the <lb/>Vodafone&apos;s Group and other mobile operators. The non-discrimination principle would apply to both <lb/>pricing and quality of the service. These undertakings were applicable for three years, although never <lb/>used. 9 The non-discrimination principle was implemented in terms of IOTs, as they are non-discriminatory <lb/>tariffs available to the GSMA members. <lb/>Large international footprints provide mobile operators with a competitive advantage, especially <lb/>when addressing the heavy roamers&apos; segment. However, due to limited spectrum availability it would not <lb/>probably be feasible for a large number of similar companies to develop large footprints across the OECD <lb/>area. The following table shows where selected internationalised operators are present. Even though a <lb/>more accurate picture could be built taking countries where operators have shares below 50%, it gives a <lb/>general image of mobile operators&apos; footprints in OECD countries and the potential for on-net offers. <lb/>Hutchinson (trading as 3) is focused on 3G communications and it has a lower market share than the other <lb/>four operators listed. <lb/>Table 1: Selected mobile operators&apos; footprints in the OECD area <lb/>10 (over 50% stake in capital) <lb/>Vodafone <lb/>Orange (France <lb/>Telecom) <lb/>T-Mobile (Deutsche <lb/>Telekom) <lb/>Movistar/O2 <lb/>(Telefonica) <lb/>3 (Hutchinson) <lb/>11 <lb/>(12 countries) <lb/>Australia, Czech <lb/>Republic, Greece, <lb/>Hungary, Ireland <lb/>Italy <lb/>12 , Spain, <lb/>Netherlands, New <lb/>Zealand, Portugal <lb/>Turkey, United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/>(7 countries) <lb/>Belgium, France, <lb/>Poland <lb/>13 , Slovak <lb/>Republic, Spain <lb/>Switzerland, United <lb/>Kingdom <lb/>(8 countries) <lb/>Austria, Czech <lb/>Republic, Germany, <lb/>Hungary, <lb/>Netherlands, Slovak <lb/>Republic, United <lb/>Kingdom, United <lb/>States <lb/>(7 countries) <lb/>Czech Republic, <lb/>Germany, Ireland, <lb/>Mexico, Slovak <lb/>Republic, Spain, <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>(7 countries) <lb/>Australia, Austria, <lb/>Denmark, Ireland, <lb/>Italy, Sweden, <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>It is not clear to what extent the possibility of capturing a bigger slice of the roaming market acts as an <lb/>incentive for market players to expand their networks and purchase foreign operators. It is clearly a factor <lb/>in the investment decision but, as roaming revenues still represent a relatively low share of the mobile <lb/>market, the roaming market is not likely to be a key criterion for whether or not to invest in another <lb/>country. <lb/>National roaming in the US shares many similarities with international roaming, due to the presence <lb/>of many regional operators that have to sign national roaming agreements if they want to offer nation-wide <lb/>services. In this regard, the FCC decided that no price regulation for national roaming would be imposed <lb/>on carriers on the grounds that this would discourage the expansion of networks beyond their regional <lb/>footprints and would give less room for price differentiation of regional call plans. The FCC obliged <lb/>carriers to provide roaming services on reasonable request, on a just, reasonable and non-discriminatory <lb/>basis. No specific price regulation was imposed, although the FCC may always intervene in the event that a <lb/>carrier demands unreasonable conditions. <lb/>Generally, therefore, more customers would benefit if trans-national networks are deployed and cross-<lb/>country phone plans are brought to the market. These potential benefits for larger operators&apos; customers <lb/>should be set against the consumer benefits of enabling smaller operators to operate on the market, such as <lb/></body>

			<body>by avoiding margin squeeze. Enabling a certain number of players to enter the market, so that the overall <lb/>mobile market remains competitive, is important to benefit consumers. In particular, small, new and <lb/>independent operators may have the necessary incentives to disrupt the status quo by offering lower prices <lb/>or new services, leading larger operators to compete and benefitting consumers. Nonetheless, this policy <lb/>should avoid to the extent possible preserving excess or inefficient capacity in the marketplace. <lb/>Many factors should be taken into account when addressing the regulation of roaming services. <lb/>Competition by smaller operators should be fostered, but the overall functioning of the market including <lb/>the benefits that larger operators may deliver in terms of scale economies and large footprints should also <lb/>be borne in mind. An analogy could be made with other issues of telecoms regulation, such as local loop <lb/>unbundling, etc., where regulators and policy makers must take into account the need to enable investment <lb/>and to foster competition and innovation. Some policy approaches could favour one in the short term, <lb/>while having a negative impact on the other in the longer term, and this is why a reasonable and balanced <lb/>approach needs to be found. <lb/>Trans-national footprints clearly enable mobile operators to provide roaming services at rates close to <lb/>domestic ones since they are no longer reliant on wholesale charges levied by foreign operators. This way, <lb/>trans-national networks provide the foundations for sustainable and market-driven lower roaming rates. <lb/>Whether providers want to reduce roaming rates or they prefer to keep high retail roaming charges depends <lb/>on the elasticity assessment conducted by them. Due to competition dynamics at the retail level and the <lb/>fact that roaming services are an element of the mobile bundle, operators may not lower prices but instead <lb/>retain high revenues by non price-elastic customers. <lb/>Smaller players could have access to reasonable wholesale roaming services by coming together and <lb/>forming trans-national alliances. However, for various reasons it may not be possible to form such <lb/>alliances in which case smaller operators would be at a disadvantage unless they have access to a dispute <lb/>resolution procedure in the country where roaming is taking place. This procedure would aim at ensuring <lb/>reasonable wholesale roaming conditions and that they are not charged excessive charges by visited <lb/>networks. In a way, this would mean a similar guarantee to that used in the United States for national <lb/>roaming. However, the visited country&apos;s NRA would very likely have an incentive to put in place such a <lb/>dispute resolution procedure only if reciprocity is assured (its domestic operators have access to a similar <lb/>procedure in other countries). In other words, it is unlikely that such dispute resolution procedures would <lb/>develop unless there was reciprocal agreement among two or more countries to develop such a mechanism. <lb/>In Australia, the House of Representatives Communications Committee inquired into whether <lb/>international mobile roaming charges are fair, after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <lb/>found in 2005 that &quot; the prices of international roaming services may exceed their underlying costs of <lb/>provision by a significant amount &quot; . 14 The Committee released a report 15 on 19 March 2009 that agreed on <lb/>the high cost of using mobile phones abroad and released some recommendations. As the Australian <lb/>Inquiry on roaming points out, in some cases reciprocity or bilateral co–operation is necessary in order to <lb/>guarantee that the home country&apos;s citizens will benefit from lower wholesale roaming charges. That <lb/>inquiry notes that regulating the wholesale cost of roaming is very complicated due to the international <lb/>element involved (namely the lack of jurisdiction on the wholesale charges faced by Australian providers), <lb/>and advises that international agreements be reached. <lb/>However, some regulatory frameworks (e.g. European Regulatory Framework) allow for the <lb/>imposition of wholesale IMRS obligations if market dominance ( &quot; significant market power &quot; ) is found, <lb/>whether or not these principles are observed by their counterparts in the country sending roaming <lb/>customers. Nevertheless, the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications has not proved <lb/>sufficient to enable the EU NRAs to act effectively in the consumers&apos; interest in this specific area 16 , which <lb/>ultimately led to the need for direct regulation of roaming rates in the EU, by means of the EU roaming <lb/></body>

			<body>regulation. However, if under the EU regulatory framework, market dominance had been found by a NRA, <lb/>no reciprocity would have been needed in order to warrant wholesale regulation, although that would <lb/>benefit visiting customers and not its own customers roaming abroad. <lb/>Global MVNOs <lb/>The first phase of the OECD work on IMRS stressed the importance of &quot; localisation &quot; , that is, the <lb/>ability of &quot; foreign &quot; service providers to be treated in the same way as local MVNOs. This way, foreign <lb/>mobile operators would be by-passing the IOT framework and thus not paying roaming charges, but rather <lb/>reaching agreements similar to what MVNOs had at the national level. <lb/>It should be recalled that the main reason in creating MVNO frameworks was to develop market <lb/>contestability given that spectrum limited the number of mobile network operators (MNOs) in a country, <lb/>consequently limiting competition in the market. Typically, a MVNO has much lower entry and exit costs, <lb/>and usually signs an agreement with a mobile network operator (MNO) in order to resell its airtime under a <lb/>new brand. MVNOs typically are assigned their own numbering resources, manage their own SIM-cards <lb/>and transport networks, bill customers, have their own distribution and marketing networks and provide <lb/>some services that may differentiate them from MNOs. The term &quot; virtual &quot; refers to the fact that they do not <lb/>own spectrum resources, so they must agree with a MNO on airtime resell. <lb/>Traditionally, MVNOs have provided service working on a national basis and have usually targeted <lb/>low expenditure mobile consumers. Even though in many jurisdictions NRAs have to licence MVNOs and <lb/>entitle them to access numbering resources, the driver of MNO-MVNO relationships has been commercial <lb/>negotiation in most OECD countries, although in a number of countries MNOs are required to enter into <lb/>negotiation with MVNOs and in some cases wholesale access terms have been imposed by the NRA. <lb/>NRAs usually keep the right to mediate in the event that no agreement is reached. In some cases, no or few <lb/>conflicts have arisen, contrary to the NRA&apos;s expectations. 17 <lb/>Assume, as defined in the first phase of the work on IMRS, a global MVNO is considered a &quot; foreign &quot; <lb/>service provider that is treated in the same way as local MVNOs paying domestic wholesale rates, rather <lb/>than wholesale roaming rates. If the same provider gets MVNO access in a number of countries, this <lb/>enables local pricing for roaming services. While the model is not widely used by MNOs or &quot; conventional &quot; <lb/>MVNOs, it is used by some &quot; global-MVNOs &quot; , that are in fact providers focused on roaming calls and <lb/>travellers, who use this regulatory tool to bypass the IOT system. They need regulatory frameworks that <lb/>enable MVNO treatment to get access to numbers and airtime on local terms and conditions and agree on <lb/>roaming or billing agreements with an MNO or MVNO in the visited countries. Then, a global-MVNO <lb/>uses its own infrastructure to interconnect those different customers, thus bypassing the IOT framework. <lb/>This is why they are potentially able to offer very competitive rates. <lb/>The existence of roaming hubs or convenient international gateway possibilities is a requirement for <lb/>viable interconnection across countries for global-MVNOs and for providers taking the approach of <lb/>reducing roaming charges. While not being an MVNO, Zain&apos;s &quot; One Network &quot; took advantage of the recent <lb/>liberalisation of East Africa&apos;s international gateways. Without convenient and reasonably priced <lb/>international gateway connections, operators would not be able to launch cheap roaming plans. <lb/>Nonetheless, there are only a few offers from such global-MVNOs, which were analysed in the <lb/>previous OECD report. Examples include Transatel, Camel Wireless, Rebtel, CallGSM, Mint Telecom, etc. <lb/>These companies have somehow remained as niche offers, not very well known in terms of branding, with <lb/>a relatively small customer base. Some of them offer the possibility of call-forwarding from the home <lb/>number to the visited country&apos;s local number (obtained by means of MVNOs agreements). This may <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>enhance substitutability, since consumers would be able to receive calls. This feature is however not <lb/>available for free, although forwarded calls are generally reasonably priced. <lb/>Taking into account the number of countries where MVNO access seems to be possible (as an <lb/>example, CallGSM has up to 50 local identities), MVNO access requirements do not seem to be a barrier <lb/>for those providers to launch their offers, although MVNO agreements are subject to commercial <lb/>negotiation and as such, a provider may not find the terms offered by MNOs commercially attractive. <lb/>A challenge that MVNOs focused on roaming may face when negotiating access is that they may not <lb/>have as much traffic as purely national MVNOs may have, and so their negotiating power may be lower <lb/>than that of the purely national MVNOs, as volumes are lower too. Average wholesale rates that MVNOs <lb/>pay are supposedly far lower than many roaming rates negotiated within the IOT framework. In countries <lb/>where MVNOs are entering the market, NRAs should act as a dispute resolution body (NRAs may even <lb/>regulate wholesale MVNO access) that guarantees reasonable conditions for airtime deals. <lb/>The concept of global-MVNOs as a viable model to bypass high roaming charges depends on how <lb/>these global MVNOs are structured and largely relies on the price-elasticity of the customer base, and <lb/>whether customers are willing to use a close substitute. It should be borne in mind that customers may not <lb/>want global MVNOs as their domestic mobile service provider but only as a roaming substitute. Then, if <lb/>customers still keep their subscription with another domestic provider, and do not switch to the new one, <lb/>global MVNOs are not perfect substitutes, as customers would not be able to receive calls to their domestic <lb/>(non-MVNO) number. In addition, MVNOs generally are low-cost offers that are mainly addressed to <lb/>low–expenditure customers. In most countries, high-expenditure customers including heavy roamers have <lb/>a preference for MNOs as providers of domestic mobile services. Although that may change in the short-<lb/>medium term, MVNOs face the challenge of the heavy users&apos; segment being focused on MNOs. <lb/>A question that may arise is why there are not many documented MNOs (see Sympac) 18 that are <lb/>established overseas and that request MVNO access in another country in order to bypass the IOT <lb/>framework and gain access on local conditions. Being able to sign roaming agreements, MNOs may not be <lb/>interested in breaking away from the IOT framework, although they may get lower wholesale rates as an <lb/>MVNO. Another reason for that may be the possible loss of roaming traffic in the MNO&apos;s home market, <lb/>since its counterparts would likely switch to the selected network. <lb/>The emergence of global-MVNOs as an alternative to roaming is heavily dependent on brand <lb/>awareness, price elasticity of consumers and their promotion as substitutes to roaming. They may well fit <lb/>into the preferences of customer segments that are very price-elastic and very aware of roaming costs and <lb/>roaming substitutes. Global MVNOs may have to appeal to NRAs in order to get reasonable MVNO access <lb/>conditions, considering that their traffic might well be below national market oriented MVNOs. Global <lb/>MVNOs have as their most important drawbacks the fact that they are imperfect roaming substitutes, the <lb/>loss of incoming calls, the fact that a SIM-card must be replaced (when no handset lock prevents it), etc. <lb/>A WTO Solution? <lb/>One framework that might be used to address the trans-national element of IMRS is provided by the <lb/>World Trade Organisation (WTO), through: <lb/>• The WTO Agreement 19<lb/>• The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) 20<lb/></body>

			<body>• Telecommunications Reference Paper 21 , scheduled as an additional commitment under Article <lb/>XVIII of GATS. Today, 82 WTO countries have committed to it 22 .<lb/>• Annex on Telecommunications 23 .<lb/>For clarity, the Telecommunications Reference Paper and the Annex on Telecommunications will be <lb/>included as Annexes to this report. <lb/>The Reference Paper <lb/>The Reference Paper states that &quot; Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of <lb/>preventing suppliers who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-<lb/>competitive practices &quot; , where a major supplier is defined as having &quot; the ability to materially affect the <lb/>terms of participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic <lb/>telecommunications services as a result of: (a) control over essential facilities: or (b) use of its position in <lb/>the market. Further, an essential facility is defined as one that &quot; is exclusively or predominantly provided by <lb/>a single or limited number of suppliers &quot; , and that &quot; cannot feasibly be economically or technically <lb/>substituted in order to provide a service &quot; . It distinguishes basic from value-added telecommunications, <lb/>with mobile services considered to be basic telecommunications. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">It is not clear whether visited operators could be considered as major suppliers, in other words, <lb/>whether, after defining a market, one or more players can be said to be dominant in that market, that are <lb/>anti-competitively exercising market power. 24 In fact, this dominance analysis has been conducted by some <lb/>EU regulatory authorities, and no dominance was found, provoking the outcome of the EU roaming <lb/>regulation, since tools in the EU regulatory framework did not seem to address the roaming problem <lb/>adequately. Since no dominance (individual or collective) could be found, the EC withdrew the wholesale <lb/>international mobile roaming market from the new recommendation of relevant markets for SMP <lb/>assessment, issued in December 2007. 25 The EC found that it was not possible for a single NRA acting <lb/>alone to address the exceptional concerns of this market (e.g. cross-borders), and removed it from the list <lb/>while enforcing ad hoc regulation. The WTO instruments, also a trans-national entity, might be suitable to <lb/>tackle the problems of IMRS. Once a &quot; major supplier &quot; has been found, the Reference paper also requires <lb/>that it &quot; make publicly available either its interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer &quot; . <lb/>On the basis of the existing Telecommunications Reference Paper, it could be argued that competitive <lb/>safeguards could be applied to IMRS. Since most countries have three or four mobile networks (less <lb/>commonly two or five), the roaming service may only be offered by a limited number of suppliers. <lb/>Additionally, the visited mobile network can be thought of as not feasibly being economically or <lb/>technically substituted in order to provide the (roaming) service, since there are entry barriers (e.g. <lb/>spectrum licences) to mobile service provision. Therefore, visited networks would match the definition of <lb/> &quot; essential facility &quot; . The question here is whether MNOs (either individually or jointly) have &quot; the ability to <lb/>materially affect the terms of participation (regarding price and supply) in the relevant market, as a result <lb/>of the control of essential facilities, and the use of its position in the market &quot; . Indeed, if visited operators <lb/>are able to exert negotiating power on home operators selling wholesale roaming well above cost, <lb/>dominance 26 could be demonstrated in that home operators obtain supernormal profits when selling <lb/>wholesale roaming services. 27 <lb/>Another option would be to seek to show that the STIRA (Standard Terms for International Roaming <lb/>Agreements) violates competition law. The STIRA were cleared by the EC in 1996 and 1998 that granted <lb/>letters of comfort, 28 following a request by the GSM Association. The STIRA remains in &quot; commercial <lb/>confidence &quot; . This, of course, could be challenged again if existing conditions have changed, such as <lb/>mobile market evolution, changes in regulatory frameworks, development of traffic steering techniques, <lb/></note>

			<body>penetration of GSM technologies, or the overall functioning of the IOT framework. Any possible finding <lb/>of STIRA&apos;s violation of competition law would be likely to dissolve existing roaming contracts, and an <lb/>alternative way-forward would need to be found in that event. <lb/>The Reference Paper also contains some undertakings on interconnection, which apply to linking with <lb/>suppliers providing telecommunication services. However, this addresses interconnection obligations as a <lb/>regulatory instrument that a government should enforce in order to allow users of one supplier to <lb/>communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier. The WTO <lb/>framework does not address interconnection as a service, so no schedules or commitments can address an <lb/> &quot; interconnection service &quot; , although some stakeholders, such as the Australian Telecoms Users Group <lb/>(ATUG), argue that the existing WTO provisions on interconnection should be applied to IMRS. 29 IMRS <lb/>can be considered a joint provision of Mode 1 (wholesale provision) and Mode 2 (retail provision) Modes <lb/>of Supply, under the GATS framework. Some regulatory frameworks may use a definition of <lb/> &quot; interconnection service &quot; under which IMRS may fall, but the GATS clearly states that interconnection <lb/>refers to communication between users of different suppliers, which is not the case of roaming. <lb/>There is another approach to IMRS regarding interconnection. Without access to the original number <lb/>(the one belonging to the home network) no service substitution can take place, since access to this number <lb/>is a requirement to provide an equivalent service. In other words, no service would be a roaming substitute <lb/>if it does not provide incoming calls to the home network&apos;s number. Therefore, the SIM-card (or more <lb/>specifically, access to the home number) is essential to provide a substitute service. Third parties could <lb/>therefore request access to the SIM (and to the number) in order to provide a seamless service. This would <lb/>be somewhat unusual but, from the point of view of technology, it is possible to provide an additional <lb/>IMSI over the air to a SIM and allow the delivery of another identity for the roamer. The party requesting <lb/>access to the SIM can be any of the visited country&apos;s network operators (now trading independently of the <lb/>home provider) or any other MVNO present in the visited country. In order to provide a seamless service <lb/>that does not involve a roaming agreement with the home operator, access to the SIM and provision of <lb/>IMSI are the missing parts of the value chain. The rest of the elements can be provided by any other <lb/>operator, and they include domestic services, SMS, international transit and call termination service back <lb/>home or to a third country. <lb/>The Annex to the GATS <lb/>The Annex on Telecommunications to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) <lb/>addresses the specific characteristics of the telecommunication services sector. According to Article XXIX, <lb/>any Annex is an integral part of the GATS. The provisions of the Annex are in addition to the general rules <lb/>of the GATS, supplementing and strengthening them. The Annex guarantees suppliers of liberalised <lb/>commercial services reasonable and non-discriminatory access to basic telecommunications networks and <lb/>services. 30 This includes suppliers of basic and value-added telecommunications, as well as suppliers of <lb/>services delivered using telecommunications. The Annex supplements and strengthens the provisions in the <lb/>GATS in Article VI on domestic regulation, Article VIII on monopoly and exclusive suppliers and Article <lb/>IX on business practices. <lb/>The Annex applies to measures imposed by member states that affect trade in services. The measures <lb/>are defined very generally in Article XXVIII to include: a law, regulatory rule, procedure, decision or <lb/>administrative action. 31 In particular, the Annex applies to measures affecting access to and use of public <lb/>telecommunications, both for the provision of basic telecommunications and value-added services. Mobile <lb/>communications are, in principle, included in this Annex. While wholesale mobile services are not <lb/>specifically mentioned they are important for access to and use of public telecommunications and, as such, <lb/>could be assumed to be covered by the Annex. <lb/></body>

			<body>Unlike the Reference Paper there is no obligation in the Annex to find the operators to be major <lb/>suppliers and dominant, nor does it focus on interconnection. Article 2(c)i limits the application of the <lb/>Annex to commitments made in the schedule of a member. More than 90 governments have made specific <lb/>commitments on mobile cellular services in their GATS schedules, although it should not be necessary to <lb/>list cellular or mobile services as a separate subsector. Besides, unless otherwise stated in the sector <lb/>column, any basic telecom services may be provided on a facilities-basis or by resale and through any <lb/>means of technology 32 . Article 5(a) of the Annex states: <lb/> &quot; Each Member shall ensure that any service supplier of any other Member is accorded access to <lb/>and use of public telecommunications transport networks and services on reasonable and non-<lb/>discriminatory terms and conditions, for the supply of a service included in its Schedule. &quot; <lb/>Non-discriminatory treatment is defined in a footnote, as being understood: <lb/> &quot; … to refer to most-favoured-nation and national treatment as defined in the Agreement, as well as <lb/>to reflect sector-specific usage of the term to mean &quot; terms and conditions no less favourable than <lb/>those accorded to any other user of like public telecommunications transport networks or services <lb/>under like circumstances &quot; . <lb/>Article 5(a) is to be applied using paragraphs 5(b) to 5(f). The first of these grants suppliers access to <lb/>and use of any public telecommunications transport network or service offered within or across the border <lb/>of that member state. This must be understood to include mobile telecommunications and services. <lb/>The central provision of the GATT and the GATS is the regulation of regulation, requiring the <lb/>avoidance of discrimination. This is laid down in terms of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and National <lb/>Treatment obligations. 33 Article XVII of the GATS on National Treatment states: <lb/> &quot; 1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule, and subject to any conditions and qualifications set out <lb/>therein, each Member shall accord to services and service suppliers of any other Member, in <lb/>respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than that it <lb/>accords to its own like services and service suppliers. <lb/>2. A Member may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service <lb/>suppliers of any other Member, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to <lb/>that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers. <lb/>3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it <lb/>modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Member <lb/>compared to like services or service suppliers of any other Member. <lb/>Regarding the GATS and its Annexes, it is the schedule that sets when a WTO member phases in <lb/>obligations for a particular service. Mobile communications are included in the GATS, either generally <lb/>under &quot; Voice telephone services &quot; , or specifically under Telecommunication services/Other(o)/Mobile <lb/>telephone services. 34 The GATS distinguishes between four modes of supplying services (trade): cross-<lb/>border trade, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons. Thus, roaming <lb/>would be a mixture of Modes 1 (cross-border trade: service flows from the territory of one Member into <lb/>the territory of another Member) and 2 (consumption abroad: situations where a service consumer moves <lb/>into another Member&apos;s territory to obtain a service) 35 . Roaming services would be a form of provision of <lb/>mobile service across borders, in that mode 1 would address the wholesale relationship between visited and <lb/>home network operators, and mode 2 would be related to the retail provision of roaming services. <lb/>Therefore, if roaming services are not to be included under the current commitments, they have to be <lb/>explicitly excluded by a country in its schedule. This has not been the case so far. Only Uganda sets some <lb/>constraints on roaming, namely the access via the major licence operator&apos;s network. 36 <lb/></body>

			<body>During the debates of the EU roaming regulation, it was argued 37 that providing regulated wholesale <lb/>prices only to operators in the EU and the EEA would be discriminatory. However, in its dealing with the <lb/>WTO all the countries in the EEA and EU are to be treated as a single nation. Consequently, &quot; national <lb/>treatment &quot; includes the provision of wholesale IMRS at regulated prices in the 30 Member States of the <lb/>EEA and the EU. <lb/>By contrast, where countries wish to explore bi-or multi-lateral regulation outside the scope of an <lb/>overarching supra-national authority, it might be contended that, if a wholesale price cap were applied to <lb/>the visited networks of the countries concerned, then those visited networks would, under the GATS, have <lb/>to offer capped prices not just amongst themselves, but also to operators ( &quot; service providers &quot; ) from all <lb/>WTO-signatory countries. An alternative view is that, at least where the countries involved are party to a <lb/>comprehensive trade agreement, they may be able to rely on Article V of the GATS which exempts WTO <lb/>Members from the most-favoured nation provision of the GATS. <lb/>Accordingly, in countries where there is national automatic roaming it could be argued that there <lb/>should also be an obligation for mobile operators to offer national roaming services on a just, reasonable <lb/>and non-discriminatory basis to foreign operators. In other words, operators from other countries should be <lb/>able to sign wholesale deals with mobile operators, under the same &quot; national treatment &quot; and MFN <lb/>obligation. <lb/>One option may be to use the WTO framework to request that national roaming access conditions be <lb/>applied to every other country, on the basis of the MFN and National Treatment obligations. That would <lb/>initiate a dispute procedure that is likely to be time-consuming and politically challenging. It is doubtful <lb/>whether any WTO member would be willing to engage in such a process, whose outcome may take some <lb/>years and be politically compromising. It is not clear either whether mobile roaming services represent an <lb/>important enough profit loss for a WTO member&apos;s operator to initiate such a dispute settlement procedure. <lb/>Finally, it should be noted that the use of WTO rules to address the issue of unreasonably high or <lb/>discriminatory rates need not be effectuated simply by dispute settlement. Rather, if an awareness of the <lb/>relevance of these rules develops, NRAs may be persuaded to either regulate or threaten to regulate <lb/>unreasonable and discriminatory rates, without actually having to litigate, recognising that the threat of <lb/>litigation is an important motivating element. <lb/>It is noteworthy that the WTO framework is normally used by governments to conduct claims against <lb/>other countries on behalf of their industry, that is, it is the trade barriers posed by a country to a third <lb/>country&apos;s industry that ultimately make the third country&apos;s government initiate a dispute settlement <lb/>procedure. In the roaming case, as the industry generally is against further regulation of roaming services, <lb/>it would be somewhat unusual that a government intervened initiating a dispute under GATS lacking <lb/>support from industry, or rather, against its will. <lb/>As a summary, roaming services can be assumed to be already covered under the current GATS <lb/>provisions on telecommunications services. Using the Reference Paper provision to prove that one or more <lb/>providers (visited operators) have a dominant position (as major suppliers of an essential facility) and <lb/>apply remedies has proved to be a difficult challenge (e.g. the European Union). Therefore, the use of the <lb/>MFN principle is a way to explore by governments, in that just, reasonable and non-discriminatory <lb/>conditions should be offered to any operator requesting them. <lb/>To Publish or Not to Publish <lb/>The first report on international roaming addressed the issue of publications of IOTs and/or negotiated <lb/>wholesale charges as a tool to promote transparency, market scrutiny of roaming charges, as well as a <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>means to separate wholesale and retail charges for consumers, improving awareness of cost causation by <lb/>visited operators and/or retail margins. However, the possible publication of IOTs and/or negotiated <lb/>wholesale rates raised some concerns by operators and regulators about commercial confidentiality, <lb/>discouragement of discounts and the facilitation of tacit collusion around the published price, and <lb/>impossibility to impose obligations on wholesale rates disclosure on operators. <lb/>First, a distinction should be made between the publication of IOTs (non-discriminatory wholesale <lb/>roaming rates available to each GSMA member with the exception of competitors from the same country), <lb/>and the publication of actual wholesale rates that operators charge each other. Usually, operators negotiate <lb/>discounts below the IOT (which is non-discriminatory and can be obtained without negotiation), depending <lb/>on the bargaining power of both counterparts, such as volume reductions, traffic balance, etc. Sometimes, <lb/>operators negotiate discounts below the IOT with one of the visited country&apos;s operators, to which the <lb/>majority of the traffic is directed through traffic-steering techniques, and then have roaming agreements at <lb/>IOT price with the rest of the operators in that country, that will eventually provide routes for traffic <lb/>overflow or complement coverage. <lb/>One problem of the IOT framework is that it is not transparent so that it is not evident to what extent <lb/>initiatives such as traffic steering, hubs, etc., as well as other technologies, are placing competitive pressure <lb/>on wholesale rates. One possible way forward to inform this question would be that IOTs, like retail prices, <lb/>were a matter of public record. Arguments have been made that IOT publication would lead to collusive <lb/>behaviour, in that it would discourage further discounts or negotiation between providers, placing a <lb/>reference cap onto any negotiation on wholesale rates, thus supporting the ability of firms to fix prices at <lb/>higher levels than otherwise would be the case. Another example of the publication of wholesale rates was <lb/>the case of the settlement rates for international fixed telephony services and in this case publication may <lb/>have helped in lowering wholesale (and retail) prices, although commercial and technological <lb/>developments are likely to have been much greater disruptive forces. There is value in having greater <lb/>transparency as a means of supporting benchmarking of IOTs and, for example, acting to highlight <lb/>situations where operators raise IOTs in an unreasonable, unjustified manner. <lb/>When discussing the publication of IOTs, they seem to be already a matter of public record, except for <lb/>those operators in the same country. In addition, due to trans-national operator footprint and the very <lb/>common presence of subsidiaries in several countries, operators should be able to know IOTs in almost <lb/>every country including their own, the exception to this being perhaps one operator having no subsidiaries <lb/>abroad. In this case, this operator would not be able to know the IOTs published by its competing <lb/>counterparts. <lb/>A different question is whether publication of actual (after negotiation) wholesale rates should be a <lb/>matter of public record. Unlike IOTs, actual wholesale rates are the result of bilateral commercial <lb/>negotiation, depending on volumes, bargaining power, etc. Wholesale rate publication would reveal the <lb/>actual level of charges levied between operators, and bring to public scrutiny actual retail margins applied. <lb/>In what refers to transparency and information for consumers, this would be the best option (for consumers <lb/>who are aware and sufficiently engaged to seek and use such information). It would however raise <lb/>concerns regarding commercial confidentiality and discourage negotiations between operators. <lb/>In respect of IOTs, this report advocates that they should be brought to public record, as they <lb/>apparently are very well known by industry players and thus, it would not lead to anticompetitive <lb/>behaviour. Since IOTs are non-discriminatory rates that operators have to offer to each other, it may <lb/>provide consumers with an overall impression on wholesale charges, although further discounts may be <lb/>negotiated by operators. <lb/></body>

			<body>Regarding actual wholesale rates, this paper has strong reservations about the pertinence of mandating <lb/>(in the event that it could be mandated) the publication of negotiated wholesale rates. This would mean a <lb/>strong limitation of market freedom, commercial innovation, and might have collusive implications. It <lb/>would raise serious concerns for commercial confidentiality. <lb/>Again, the question of the necessary legal basis to impose obligations arises, since it is not clear to <lb/>what extent NRAs or public authorities may oblige operators to publish IOTs or negotiated wholesale rates. <lb/>Most national regulatory frameworks allow data collection for the purpose of statistical collection, <lb/>benchmark and information for consumers, so it would not be difficult to extend this obligation to the <lb/>publications of IOTs/wholesale rates. This may be against the conditions set by GSMA which, as industry <lb/>association, would be willing to protect its interests. However, if telecommunications policy makers agree <lb/>on the convenience of publishing IOTs, such publication should be enforced. Since publication of IOTs in <lb/>one country would basically affect foreign roamers in that country and vice-versa, multi-national <lb/>agreements would be advisable, so that policy makers act in a co-ordinated way that fulfils the objectives <lb/>of greater transparency of IOTs and better consumer information in a more effective and timely way. <lb/>One possible way forward regarding wholesale rates (not IOTs) publication is that regulators check <lb/>their competitive state, collect the data and produce an internal benchmark to inform regulatory policy, <lb/>while ensuring commercial confidentiality and avoiding influencing the negotiation of discounts. Countries <lb/>could consider going further and enabling NRAs to publish aggregate data on the average wholesale price <lb/>for their particular country, without revealing individual operator data to the public. This is the approach <lb/>taken by the European Regulators Group –ERG – data benchmark report on roaming, 38 which NRAs are <lb/>empowered to produce in order to verify compliance with the retail and wholesale price caps under the EU <lb/>Roaming Regulation. This option would provide policy makers and consumers with a clearer view of the <lb/>wholesale and the retail margin components of their retail roaming prices, while leaving room for some <lb/>commercial confidentiality. This is the approach that this report proposes to take. Again, such data <lb/>collection would need to be supported by a legal basis, as mentioned before. Therefore, it is advisable that <lb/>countries develop the legal basis to enable NRAs to collect these data. <lb/>Wholesale Price Regulation <lb/>A possible approach to ensure reasonable wholesale roaming charges is direct price regulation, which <lb/>should be aimed at increasing market contestability and giving room for price arbitrage and profit <lb/>realisation. Regulated wholesale charges should also avoid margin squeeze, especially for smaller <lb/>operators. Wholesale price regulation enables operators to pass savings through to the retail level and offer <lb/>lower retail tariffs. However, where the retail level is not sufficiently competitive, retail price regulation <lb/>may be necessary to ensure that consumers benefit. Therefore, retail price caps mainly focus on ensuring a <lb/>reasonable price level for end-users. Both types of price regulation address different needs, but are very <lb/>much related to each other. In terms of cost origination, retail charges contain a share of wholesale charges <lb/>and NRAs should therefore consider them in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis. <lb/>That is why both types of price regulation have been merged in one single section, which has been <lb/>included in the chapter &quot; Policies addressing the consumer perspective &quot; . There, the approach to wholesale <lb/>roaming charges together with retail price regulation will be discussed, even though wholesale price <lb/>regulation may better fit in this section. <lb/></body>

			<body>POLICIES ADDRESSING THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE <lb/>Retail and Wholesale Price Regulation <lb/>In the previous report, IMRS prices were found to be too high, in that consumers pay much higher <lb/>prices than the underlying costs of providing the service. It was also argued that this creates problems for <lb/>consumer protection, since consumers pay far higher prices for IMRS than otherwise would be the case, <lb/>i.e. if roaming services were subject to competitive forces. Further outcomes of this harming situation are <lb/>barriers to international trade and travel. As a consequence, there is a widespread feeling among regulators, <lb/>policy makers and consumers for the enforcement of rules that prevent consumers from being <lb/>unreasonably charged for roaming services. <lb/>As highlighted in the first part of this work, there are a number of reasons why prices remain <lb/>unreasonably high (IMRS are bundled with domestic services, high wholesale charges, etc.). This report <lb/>deals with possible ways forward to tackle this problem. Some of them may directly address the problem: <lb/>high prices for IMRS, others may intend to bring some contestability to the market or increase awareness <lb/>of IMRC, substitutes, etc. This is why, regardless of other measures to promote competition, consumer <lb/>awareness, etc., retail price regulation addresses exactly the main concern of regulators, policy makers and <lb/>consumers: high retail charges. The example of the EU roaming regulation and other initiatives that aim at <lb/>regulating retail prices will be overviewed. Although not the only one, high wholesale charges have been <lb/>identified as one of the underlying factors for the problem of high retail prices. Even though wholesale <lb/>price regulation would better fit into the previous section, the fact that wholesale and retail price regulation <lb/>might be applied together, as in the EU roaming regulation, and the links between the level and form of <lb/>both types of regulation, have made it more advisable to deal with them together in this section. <lb/>Retail price regulation: what should be the regulated price? <lb/>The only example of enforced roaming price regulation is, so far, the amended EU regulation, where a <lb/>glide-path for retail caps was set. Retail and wholesale regulation were introduced to prevent excessive <lb/>pricing. These rates were thought of in conjunction with wholesale rates, in order to provide a large enough <lb/>price gap for the development of competition and regulatory exit. In this regard, cost-orientation was not <lb/>advocated. <lb/>Table 2: EU regulated retail roaming rates (without VAT) <lb/>RETAIL RATES <lb/>(Price in EUR/min) <lb/>JULY-<lb/>OCTOBER <lb/>2007 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2008 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2009 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2010 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2011 <lb/>MAKING A CALL <lb/>(mark-up) <lb/>0.49 (63%) <lb/>0.46 (64%) <lb/>0.43(65%) <lb/>0.39 (77%) <lb/>0.35 (94%) <lb/>RECEIVING A <lb/>CALL <lb/>0.24 <lb/>0.22 <lb/>0.19 <lb/>0.15 <lb/>0.11 <lb/>SENDING A SMS <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>0.11 <lb/>0.11 <lb/>0.11 <lb/>Source: European Commission. <lb/></body>

			<body>Table 3: EU regulated wholesale roaming rates (without VAT) <lb/>39 <lb/>Source: European Commission. <lb/>In the 2007 EU Roaming Regulation Impact Assessment, the EC acknowledged that retail-only <lb/>regulation was likely to squeeze margins of smaller operators, since they would not be able to negotiate <lb/>good wholesale rates, and would therefore force them to offer roaming services below cost, although the <lb/>EC has further tools to avoid abuses, such as margin squeeze tests that would lead to penalties for operators. <lb/>Moreover, the approach of EU competition law is to apply wholesale price regulation to treat the <lb/>competition bottleneck and, if competition at the retail level is not focused on roaming services so that <lb/>lower wholesale rates may not be passed through to retail roaming prices, both retail and wholesale price <lb/>regulation may be introduced. This is the approach of the EU roaming regulations. The EC examined <lb/>several options for establishing a retail cap: home pricing principle (retail roaming prices would be <lb/> &quot; pegged &quot; to the customer&apos;s home prices for comparable domestic mobile services), the visited country <lb/>approach (consumers would be charged the actual domestic rate within the visited country), European <lb/>home market approach (retail prices would be set at a level 30% above the wholesale rate, which would in <lb/>turn be drawn by multiplying the average EU mobile termination rates –MTRs – by a factor). <lb/>For the 2007 Regulation, the EC estimated the wholesale charge incurred by an operator when a <lb/>customer receives a call while roaming to be less than EUR 0.10 on average. The operator would have to <lb/>pay a termination rate to the mobile operator in the visited network, together with a transit charge. The <lb/>home operator will have either received a termination charge from the originating network or retail on-net <lb/>tariff from the caller. The initial proposal argued that the actual net real cost to operators may be less than <lb/>EUR 0.10. In its opinion, the MTR provides a good basis for the cost component of receiving calls. It <lb/>advocated setting the retail level at a 30% margin above the wholesale rate, which would be at MTR level <lb/>for receiving calls, twice the MTR for making calls within the visited country, and three times the MTR for <lb/>calling back home or to another EU country, that is, in line with the European home market approach. The <lb/>EC considered that the 30% margin above the wholesale rate would ensure that savings are passed on to <lb/>consumers, as well as providing operators with some comfort. Meanwhile, the European Regulators Group <lb/>(ERG), proposed a wholesale rate of twice the 75 th percentile of the average MTR within the EU to allow <lb/>for cost recovery by efficient operators. <lb/>At the request of the European Parliament&apos;s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, <lb/>Copenhagen Economics delivered an assessment 40 of the EC proposal on roaming. It had a number of <lb/>differences with the Commission proposal. Namely, it proposed using national average MTRs instead of <lb/>national peak MTRs, since NRAs regulate average and not peak MTRs, and advocated to use the 75 th <lb/>percentile, in line with the ERG opinion, which would be high enough to ensure cost recovery by an <lb/>efficient operator. It also proposed a single cap for roaming local calls and calls back home or to a third EU <lb/>country. It argued that it makes no sense to attribute an additional MTR (then at around EUR 0.116/min) in <lb/>order to cover international transit which is priced at around EUR 0.02, since international transit (intra-EU <lb/>routes) represents the major cost difference between calls made back home/calls to a third country and <lb/>WHOLESALE <lb/>RATES (in <lb/>EUR/min) <lb/>JULY-<lb/>OCTOBER <lb/>2007 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2008 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2009 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2010 <lb/>SUMMER <lb/>2011 <lb/>MAKING A CALL <lb/>0.30 <lb/>0.28 <lb/>0.26 <lb/>0.22 <lb/>0.18 <lb/>RECEIVING A <lb/>CALL <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>SENDING A SMS <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.04 <lb/></body>

			<body>local calls. Copenhagen Economics quoted confidential information from several operators as their source. <lb/>It also suggested that there should be a cost difference for calls made depending on the call&apos;s termination <lb/>network (fixed or mobile), as MTRs are much higher than fixed termination rates (average fixed <lb/>termination rate was around EUR 0.01/min and the MTR around EUR 0.1234/min, using the ERG data <lb/>from 2006). <lb/>At the retail level, that study also disagreed with the 30% mark-up initially proposed by the <lb/>Commission, as it believed that the method of &quot; proportionate allocation &quot; of retail costs is a better way of <lb/>assessing retails costs for roaming in eurocents per minute, instead of adding up a fixed percentage of <lb/>wholesale costs, acknowledging the fact that operators incur retail costs (marketing, handset subsidies, etc.), <lb/>and should be borne proportionately by all the mobile services in the bundle (domestic calls, SMS, etc.). <lb/>Following this method, EUR 0.14 per minute was found to be the adequate retail mark-up both for calls <lb/>made and received. A.T. Kearney was identified as the source that estimates average retail costs per minute <lb/>to be around EUR 0.10 for a sample of European operators, based on activity-based cost (ABC) allocation <lb/>method. The calculated reasonable return in the telecommunications industry, calculated by means of <lb/>averaging across measures (profit margin, EBIT, EBITDA, etc.) was found to be 15 %. However, the <lb/>return is only calculated on the retail costs, which gives less than EUR 0.02/min. 41 <lb/>Additionally, this study suggested that retail price caps be applied on average over all calls, not for <lb/>individual calls, and proposed a consumer protection tariff well above these levels that would have been <lb/>offered to all consumers by all providers. Finally, they estimate the roaming specific costs (operational, <lb/>marketing, etc.) to be around EUR 0.02/min. <lb/>Another study commissioned by the same European Parliament Committee 42 , on technical issues of <lb/>roaming, describes in one of its sections the technical infrastructure of roaming and analyses whether the <lb/>system creates increased costs. Its conclusion was that IMRS costs are between 10% and 20% higher than <lb/>a national-only system, a figure supported by a separate estimate that suggests added costs of about <lb/>EUR 0.02-0.03/call. <lb/>Finally, a trade-off was reached between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the <lb/>Council, with the outcome charted in the previous tables. It is noteworthy that the retail mark-up increases <lb/>over time (from 63% to 94%), aiming at giving more opportunities for retail-rates below the cap. The <lb/>absolute margin slightly decreases (from EUR 0.19 to EUR 0.17). However, as ERG reports have shown, <lb/>the majority of retail prices are at or near the cap, indicating a lack of competition at the retail level. These <lb/>caps and the EU regulation were designed to ensure users do not pay excessive prices for roaming <lb/>compared to competitive national prices, thereby contributing to the smooth running of the internal market. <lb/>The EC in the Impact Assessment 43 of the proposed amended regulation identifies the consumer protection <lb/>problem as follows: <lb/> &quot; However despite these gains, it appears that the structural problems with this market have remained <lb/>intact. While voice roaming services may be an important source of revenues and profits for a mobile <lb/>operator, from the point of view of consumers prices for voice roaming are perceived as prices for only <lb/>one element of a larger mobile bundle purchased – and as a less important element of this bundle than, <lb/>say, domestic voice, domestic SMS or a (subsidized) mobile device included in the mobile price plan &quot; . <lb/>In order to carry out a retail price regulation, consideration should be given to the price difference <lb/>between calls made and calls received. These two types of calls may be considered as substitutes to some <lb/>extent, since customers might switch from making calls to receiving them depending on price levels. If <lb/>receiving becomes cheaper, fewer or shorter calls might be made and vice versa. <lb/></body>

			<body>The experience of the EU Roaming Regulation so far has not provided clear evidence that setting <lb/>wholesale and retail price caps and transparency measures fosters competitive tariffs. The ERG benchmark <lb/>data collections 44 for 18 months of regulation show that a majority of average voice roaming prices by <lb/>country are at or near the regulated caps. Before setting a growing retail mark-up, it is necessary to <lb/>consider the question of money transfers between net out-payers and net recipient operators. Clearly, <lb/>having low wholesale rates and not so low retail tariffs could favour operators that are net roaming out-<lb/>payers. On the other hand, having high wholesale rates and low retail tariffs could favour net-receivers. <lb/>Therefore, balanced wholesale and retail regulation is needed to ensure a balanced effect on different types <lb/>of operators. The amended EU Roaming Regulation, which entered into force in June 2009 has increasing <lb/>retail-wholesale margins 45 with the intention that alternative players can find profit opportunities in setting <lb/>retail prices well below the cap, forcing dominant operators to lower them too. The EU will consider <lb/>evidence on price trends, including from the ERG, when reviewing the functioning of the Regulation in <lb/>June 2010 and June 2011. <lb/>The EU amended the roaming regulation in 2009 and extended it, among other issues, to SMSs, which <lb/>were regulated at the wholesale and retail level, as Tables 2 and 3 show. The ERG updated the roaming <lb/>regulation guidelines as a result. 46 The rationale for setting the retail and wholesale regulated price was <lb/>amongst others, the following: <lb/>The Danish National IT and Telecom Agency (Danish regulator) released in 2008 the study &quot; Analysis <lb/>of Prices and costs for Mobile Data Services Abroad &quot; 47 . In its cost model, the costs to the visited network <lb/>(wholesale costs) can be categorised in origination and international transit costs. It also assumes that <lb/>operators should be compensated for the lack of wholesale cost coverage for receiving SMS (around <lb/>EUR 0.004). In its view, the total wholesale cost would be EUR 0.008 (origination 48 would be about <lb/>EUR 0.004 and international transit costs close to zero). At the retail level, according to NITA, the costs to <lb/>the home operator for an SMS sent from abroad would be in total (breaking down costs into <lb/>handling/receiving SMS, SMS termination, retail costs) EUR 0.0268/SMS. This estimate assumes that <lb/>20% of the SMS traffic goes to networks abroad (thus costing 0) and the operator has got a 25% market <lb/>share. The retail mark-up is set at EUR 0.0348. This analysis could vary depending on differences in <lb/>national SMS termination rates. The ERG discussed this study in its submission 49 to the Commission&apos;s <lb/>public consultation on extending the 2007 EU Roaming Regulation, which the EU took into consideration <lb/>in setting a EUR 0.11 retail and EUR 0.04 wholesale cap. Again, international transit costs are based on <lb/>intra-EU traffic. It is also worth pointing out that Danish domestic SMS charges are among the lowest in <lb/>Europe, with a SMS costing typically EUR 0.003. NITA has used its LRAIC 50 model for mobile <lb/>termination with a real pre-tax WACC of 8.6 %. <lb/>In its Memorandum of Understanding, 51 the AREGNET also proposed a retail cap consisting of a <lb/>mark-up of the regulated wholesale charge. This mark-up was due to be 50% the first year, 40% the second <lb/>year, and 30% thereafter. As for the wholesale rates: <lb/>• For international outgoing roaming calls to a certain destination, the wholesale rate was set as the <lb/>retail tariff charged by the visited operator to its users for international calls to that destination, <lb/>plus a mark-up, which was again 50%, 40% and 30% for the first year, second year and thereafter, <lb/>respectively.<lb/>• For domestic outgoing roaming calls (i.e., outgoing roaming calls within the visited country), the <lb/>wholesale rate was set at the retail tariff charged by the visited operator to its users for the <lb/>domestic calls within the visited country, plus a similar mark-up.<lb/>• For incoming calls, a home provider shall not charge its user a retail tariff higher than its retail <lb/>tariff applied to such a user for international calls to a visited operator&apos;s network. The maximum<lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>wholesale rate would be that of the normal rate applied for the termination of an international <lb/>incoming call originating on the network of the home provider and terminating on the network of <lb/>the visited operator. <lb/>The AREGNET MoU also states that, for the purposes of calculating the appropriate wholesale rate, the <lb/>visited operator&apos;s retail tariff for international calls to a specific destination (reference tariff) is calculated <lb/>as an annual average of various retail tariffs for international calls to that destination, provided using the <lb/>equivalent technology to the one used to provide the regulated roaming calls, applied by that visited <lb/>operator. Accordingly, retail tariff for domestic calls is calculated as an annual average of various retail <lb/>tariffs for domestic calls provided using the equivalent technology as well. <lb/>The AREGNET MoU was endorsed by the Arab Telecommunications and Information Council of <lb/>Ministers on 4 June 2008, except for the part which concerns tariff regulation. The Council had <lb/>reservations and invited the Arab countries to endeavour to find a mechanism that would allow them to <lb/>apply the recommended regulation. 52 <lb/>Clearly, the rationale that underpins the set-up of regulated prices by the AREGNET MoU is service <lb/>and tariff comparability. Some mark-ups were also set to make for retail operator&apos;s profits, and also to <lb/>value the premium service that roaming means compared to equivalent domestic services (e.g. the MoU <lb/>caps wholesale rates by setting a mark-up on the equivalent service, that is, wholesale rate for roaming <lb/>calls made to the visited country should not be charged higher that the equivalent domestic calls plus a <lb/>mark-up). In short, the methodology followed to establish wholesale rates has been that of trying to find <lb/>equivalence with the comparable domestic service. It could be referred to as a top-down approach, by way <lb/>of contrast to the bottom-up approach that intends to find out the cost incurred by roaming service <lb/>providers. <lb/>AREGNET also identifies some challenges for the potential implementation of its MoU, such the <lb/>different stages of liberalisation that countries in the region have reached. Since roaming prices are linked <lb/>to domestic prices, the model would punish operators where liberalisation and tariff rebalancing has <lb/>progressed further. International calls (taken as reference for cap set-up), might not be cost-oriented, <lb/>especially in countries with a non-liberalised telecommunications sector. <lb/>Wholesale caps, retail caps or both? <lb/>The aim of a price regulation must always be clear. When NRAs set caps on wholesale prices, they <lb/>normally do it in order to promote competition and contestability in a specific market, by allowing <lb/>alternative providers to replicate the incumbent&apos;s retail offer with a relatively low investment level, or to <lb/>allow them to make use of a resource that they need to provide the service (e.g. mobile termination). Retail <lb/>IMRS are not normally purchased independently leading some analysts to state that it is not a market, at <lb/>least if competition law principles are used (supply-and demand-side substitutability, among others), that <lb/>is, the retail market would be the bundle of retail mobile services. <lb/>However, it can also be argued that there is a demand curve for IMRS and this demand curve is <lb/>dependent on the growth of the mobile subscriber base, that is, the demand curve for IMRS shifts outwards <lb/>as the subscriber base grows. Mobile operators subsidised the more price-sensitive side of the market <lb/>(terminal subsidies) and charged higher retail prices in the market where demand increased strongly as the <lb/>subscriber base grew (and were not concerned that wholesale prices in other countries were high since they <lb/>themselves followed the same practice). Strong growth in IMRS occurred as businesses began using <lb/>roaming extensively and were less price sensitive since individual users were in most cases not paying the <lb/>charges (as opposed to the companies that paid the bills). The situation changed as residential subscribers <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>entered the mobile and subsequently the roaming market, since their demand curve is supposed to be <lb/>different from that of the business segment, namely more price-sensitive. <lb/>The rationale for intervening in the IMRS market is to ensure consumers do not pay excessive prices <lb/>for roaming services, to lower barriers for international trade and travel, etc. Setting a wholesale cap for <lb/>roaming services alone could address the competition bottleneck of high wholesale prices but, if <lb/>competition at the retail level is focused on services other than roaming, the benefits may not be passed <lb/>through to consumers. Other measures are also necessary to improve retail competition (such as raising <lb/>consumer awareness, providing the means to decouple the mobile services bundle, etc.). Otherwise the <lb/>dynamics of the retail market may remain the same, except for the fact that prices are regulated. In this <lb/>regard, setting a high mark-up between wholesale and retail caps, while leaving room for retail competition <lb/>to develop, may not be sufficient in itself. <lb/>On the other hand, setting a wholesale cap would be very helpful to avoid margin-squeeze, especially <lb/>for smaller providers, who might not be able to obtain volume discounts at the wholesale level. <lb/>Nonetheless, if competition at the wholesale level takes place, there will not be a need to establish <lb/>wholesale caps, since competition would bring wholesale rates to a reasonable level. A wholesale cap <lb/>would also be necessary to overcome one of the identified problems for high IMRC: high wholesale <lb/>charges. However, setting only a wholesale cap does not guarantee by itself that those reductions will be <lb/>passed on to consumers in the absence of a well-functioning retail market. <lb/>In this regard, a retail cap can be considered as aiming at protecting consumers, while a wholesale cap <lb/>is supposed to improve competition. If both objectives are aimed at, it makes sense to establish both a <lb/>wholesale and a retail cap. <lb/>As has been illustrated with the examples given before, there are basically two ways of approaching <lb/>the task of setting a cap. If a top-down approach is taken, analogy must be made regarding comparable <lb/>national services, plus an additional charge that accounts for costs incurred due to the fact that the service <lb/>is provided overseas. If a bottom-up approach is taken, all costs incurred to provide the roaming service <lb/>should be analysed, choosing one of the available methodologies used by NRAs, such as the LRAIC model <lb/>(when these are constructed in a way that enables roaming costs to be accurately measured; e.g. some are <lb/>designed for voice MTR regulation only). <lb/>Since the ultimate aim of the regulating roaming prices is not to set a cost-oriented cap, but to protect <lb/>consumers and lower international barriers for trade and travel, it is not compulsory to choose a <lb/>methodology that seeks to find a cost-oriented cap. On the contrary, a top-down approach would perfectly <lb/>serve the regulatory objectives and guarantee an acceptable price for consumers. This approach involves a <lb/>lot more simplicity, and an easier way to justify the caps to consumers. The reasoning behind the caps <lb/>proposed by AREGNET is fully in line with this top-down methodology and provides, regardless of the <lb/>discussion on mark-ups on wholesale costs and retail charges to allow for profitability, a much more <lb/>intuitive approach. The ultimate aim is that subscribers are offered comparable roaming prices for <lb/>comparable domestic services, that is, they are not unreasonably charged for services that are offered to <lb/>domestic subscribers, once the extra cost (e.g. international transit) is accounted for. That being said, it is <lb/>important not to tie roaming regulation too closely to domestic prices, as that could create an incentive for <lb/>operators to refrain from lowering domestic prices. <lb/>In contrast, the FCC recently agreed to regulate 53 automatic roaming services (roaming services, <lb/>according to the terminology used in this report). It placed national roaming services under the conditions <lb/>of CMRS (commercial mobile radio services) and therefore there is a common carrier obligation to provide <lb/>roaming services to other carriers upon reasonable request and on a just, reasonable, and non-<lb/></body>

Therefore, where a carrier receives such a request, it serves the public interest for that <lb/>CMRS carrier to provide automatic roaming service to the requesting carrier. 54 <lb/>To provide guidance as to the reasonableness of automatic roaming requests, the FCC established the <lb/>presumption that a request for automatic roaming is reasonable, in the first instance, if the requesting <lb/>carrier&apos;s network is technologically compatible with the host carrier&apos;s home market(s). 55 Additionally, the <lb/>FCC established a home roaming exclusion relating to this automatic roaming obligation, stating that a <lb/>would-be host CMRS carrier is not required to provide automatic roaming to a requesting CMRS carrier in <lb/>the requesting carrier&apos;s home market. 56 The FCC defined the requesting carrier&apos;s home market to include <lb/>any geographic location where that carrier has a wireless licence or spectrum usage rights (e.g. spectrum <lb/>leasing arrangements) that could be used to provide CMRS. A number of carriers asked the FCC to <lb/>reconsider the home market exclusion, and those petitions for reconsideration are pending before the FCC. <lb/>For clarity, it is worth mentioning that automatic roaming services, following the FCC terminology, <lb/>are provided on a national basis, between carriers that do not have spectrum in the same area. 57 American <lb/> &quot; national roaming &quot; shares many similarities with IMRS, since it is provided among carriers in regions <lb/>where they do not have spectrum. From the point of view of the implementation of regulation, the main <lb/>difference is the legal basis for the FCC to enforce agreements and impose obligation, which is generally <lb/>lacked by IMRS between providers in different countries. <lb/>In that agreement, the FCC explicitly stated that price regulation was not warranted, with the <lb/>arguments that: <lb/>• Capping roaming rates may provide carriers with a benchmark that reduces incentives to lower <lb/>retail prices paid by customers. In addition, smaller regional carriers may have an incentive to <lb/>reduce the discounts they offer on regional calling plans thereby driving up the prices regional <lb/>subscribers pay within their plan&apos;s calling area.<lb/>• Roaming rates regulation may deter investment in network deployment, reducing incentives for <lb/>smaller carriers to expand the geographic coverage of their networks. If the competitive <lb/>advantage of building out nationwide or large regional networks is reduced, larger carriers <lb/>incentives to expand, upgrade or maintain their existing networks would diminish.<lb/>Clearly, imposing roaming caps in the United States reduces incentives to expand networks. It is <lb/>interesting to discuss to what extent this conclusion may be drawn for cross-country expansion. The main <lb/>driver for expansion, however, is capturing revenues in another market, either US sub-national regional <lb/>markets, or any national market. From this point of view, the same arguments that state that price <lb/>regulation is not warranted in the United States may hold for any attempt at regulating IMRS rates (e.g. EU <lb/>roaming regulation). Nonetheless, there is one characteristic that applies to the US case: national roaming <lb/>rates are not considered to be abusive or so high as to harm consumers, which was one of the main bases <lb/>on which the EU moved to regulate roaming prices. In the US case, network expansion incentives offset <lb/>other considerations, since rates are not found to be harmful for consumers. In the EU case, consumer <lb/>protection offsets any potential disincentive for cross-country consolidation. The contribution of roaming <lb/>to overall revenues and investment budgets may also be different. <lb/>Wholesale prices for incoming calls <lb/>As for incoming calls, wholesale prices have been left aside in the EU roaming regulation and debate. <lb/>This is due to the fact that visited operators usually charge mobile termination rates (MTR) to international <lb/>transit operators for inbound roaming calls. Therefore, regulating wholesale inbound charges has not been <lb/>an issue, 58 as it has been included under the standard (national) MTR regulation framework. As a matter of <lb/></body>

			<body>fact, all 27 EU regulators treat incoming roaming calls as being identical to incoming domestic calls and <lb/>MTRs have been the focus of very active regulatory activity in the EU. 59 <lb/>Other countries do not use MTRs for inbound roaming charging, but the so-called &quot; Mobile Subscriber <lb/>Roaming Numbers &quot; or MSRN termination fees, which remain unregulated. For example, Australia <lb/>explicitly excludes MSRN termination from the MTR framework. 60 Although both national and MSRN <lb/>mobile termination share many similarities, there is a difference in that a roaming call can potentially be <lb/>terminated by more than network, and not by only one as is the case of national mobile termination. <lb/>Reductions of MSRN termination fees in this latter group of countries would be helpful in reaching a more <lb/>efficient set of prices for incoming communications, but do not help in creating a contestable market. <lb/>Possibilities in regulating retail and wholesale roaming charges <lb/>Once the rationale for regulating IMRC is clear and an agreement has been found in that mobile <lb/>subscribers should be protected against extremely high roaming charges, and international trade and travel <lb/>should be favoured by this intervention, the next step towards a potential roaming charges regulation in <lb/>OECD countries should be to examine whether they have a legal basis to regulate roaming prices. <lb/>In general there are three types of authorities or competent bodies that may be in a position to regulate <lb/>roaming prices. These three types of authorities may act based on relevant legislation in force or adopted to <lb/>address these issues (such as fostering competition or protecting consumers): <lb/>• Telecommunications NRAs: whenever ex-ante sectoral regulation is warranted, they are entitled <lb/>to impose ex-ante obligations when dominance (or significant market power, following the EU <lb/>terminology) is found.<lb/>• Competition authorities: although their intervention is effected ex-post, they may be entitled to <lb/>regulate prices.<lb/>• Authorities responsible for consumer policy are normally entitled to set obligations on <lb/>transparency, price information, etc., although there is no evidence of Consumer Policy <lb/>authorities being entitled to impose price regulations.<lb/>What is stated for the first two options may hold for retail charges paid by residents of a country but it <lb/>would be harder to justify the regulation of wholesale prices paid by operators from other countries and <lb/>which therefore has no direct impact on residents of the country imposing them. However, as it was <lb/>pointed out before, some regulatory frameworks (e.g. the EU&apos;s) foresee the possibility of imposing <lb/>wholesale obligations even without reciprocity from their counterparts, at least from the point of view of <lb/>market power assessment (which concerns telecommunications NRAs and competition authorities). <lb/>Any intervention initiatives should therefore have the required legal instruments to grant price <lb/>regulation. In the EU case, after conventional ex-ante and ex-post market analysis procedures proved <lb/>unsuccessful to tackle high IMRC, the EU justified an intervention on the grounds of internal market <lb/>provisions. This intervention was not based on market definition and analysis, SMP (significant market <lb/>power) assessment and the imposition of remedies, as ex-ante remedies are usually imposed, but on <lb/>internal market provisions. The entitlement of EU authorities to grant this legislation has been appealed <lb/>and decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is pending. 61 In its opinion delivered on 1 October <lb/>2009, the ECJ&apos;s Advocate General Poiares Maduro proposes that the Court confirm the validity of the EU <lb/>roaming regulation. 62 However, OECD countries lack internal market provisions and intervention can only <lb/>be warranted on the grounds of consumer protection and removing barriers to trade and travel. <lb/></body>

			<body>Copenhagen Economics issued a report, 63 commissioned by the Swiss government, in which some <lb/>inquiries were made into possible legal instruments for an intervention on roaming prices by the Swiss <lb/>authorities, envisaging a potential bilateral agreement with the EU to regulate roaming charges. According <lb/>to the report, designating Swiss mobile operators as having a dominant position in the wholesale market for <lb/>IMRS may prove arduous, given the difficulties for some EU Member States to designate their own SMP <lb/>operators. Even if Switzerland entered into an agreement with the EU, it would have difficulties in <lb/>implementing it, since it lacks the internal market provision that the EU has. Moreover, the Swiss <lb/>sector-specific legislation is based on ex-post regulation (with more lengthy appeal procedures). It also <lb/>states that competences for regulating retail prices are spread across several authorities. The sector-specific <lb/>authority does not have competence on IMRS price regulation. <lb/>The best way forward for countries to regulate retail and wholesale rates would be to have mutual <lb/>agreements between two or more countries whereby a country &quot; A &quot; would agree to regulate its operators&apos; <lb/>wholesale mobile prices for a country &quot; B &quot; on the condition that country &quot; B &quot; also regulates the wholesale <lb/>roaming prices which operators from country &quot; A &quot; are required to pay. Then, each country may regulate its <lb/>operators&apos; retail roaming charges as well. Such an agreement would be open to all countries that were <lb/>willing to reciprocate. Wholesale prices would not necessarily have to be the same in participating <lb/>countries but would need to be based on some agreed criteria allowing for differences in cost factors. Such <lb/>co-ordination may be necessary in order to guarantee reciprocity and that there are no imbalances that may <lb/>lead to situations where operators in one country may be discriminated against or favoured compared to <lb/>another country&apos;s operators. This co-ordination may take the form of bilateral/multilateral agreements, and <lb/>maybe based on a similar framework to the one used by AREGNET, that has developed a Memorandum of <lb/>Understanding (MoU) to regulate wholesale and retail roaming charges. An existing legal basis and clear <lb/>policy objectives are a key factor to underpin any roaming price regulation. In this way, reciprocity may be <lb/>hard to enforce, since countries may have very different regulatory frameworks, legal instruments or policy <lb/>aims concerning price regulation. For these considerations, the EU is an exception, since it has distinct <lb/>legal instruments (pan-European regulation) and policy objectives (internal market provisions) than is the <lb/>case for other OECD countries. <lb/>Alternative Calling Procedures <lb/>The first OECD report on IMRS dealt with the development of alternative calling procedures for <lb/>roaming. These are known to be imperfect substitutes but are however becoming increasingly seamless. As <lb/>noted for global-MVNOs, the main drawbacks consist of low consumer awareness, lack of brand <lb/>recognition, reluctance to have two service providers at the same time, and the fact that roaming may be <lb/>relatively infrequent for most of the consumer base, thus reducing the incentive to look for more <lb/>reasonably priced and seamless substitutes. That report compiled a comprehensive list of more or less close <lb/>substitutes to roaming, which will not be analysed in depth in this report. <lb/>However, the following chart will make an attempt to summarise the main drawbacks and advantages <lb/>of substitutes for roaming. <lb/></body>

The extent to which roaming substitutes or <lb/>ACPs are used depends on price-elasticity, the importance of language barriers, technology proficiency of <lb/>users when changing SIM-cards, looking for a VoIP connection, etc. Substitutes like hotel phone calls, <lb/>e-mail or payphones are nothing new and have been available to consumers for a long time. The preference <lb/>of consumers for roaming services suggests that the possibility of using the mobile phone as they do at <lb/>home is very much appreciated. <lb/></body>

			<body>The profitability of ACP providers is uncertain and they are not likely to address the mass market in <lb/>the coming years. However, some providers addressing niche segments may well be profitable. Policy <lb/>makers should favour regulatory frameworks that allow ACP providers to launch alternative offers to <lb/>roaming services that provide customers with a wider range of options. Policy makers should, as the <lb/>following sections will point out, focus on expanding awareness of roaming substitutes, including <lb/>advantages and drawbacks that have been summarised in the previous table. <lb/>Some commercial practices such as blocking VoIP applications over handsets or charging for them <lb/>may well be investigated by regulators, in the context of the overall mobile market. These may be against <lb/>competition law or net neutrality provisions. As an example, the EU opened an investigation on the issue in <lb/>2008. 68 TruPhone threatened to sue Vodafone for blocking VoIP applications over its IP network 69 , <lb/>although Ofcom did not find any sign of anti-competitive behaviour. Vodafone and Orange were said to <lb/>have disabled VoIP functions in the Nokia N95 handset. 70 These practices may well be worth looking into <lb/>by NRAs or competition watchdogs, since they might be preventing the emergence of substitutes for (voice) <lb/>roaming. On the other hand, competition and tariff innovation seem to be developing in this area. For <lb/>example, in the United Kingdom, Three has made inclusive access to VoIP a marketing point. Vodafone, <lb/>O2 and Deutsche Telekom have recently announced that they will no longer block VoIP access over their <lb/>networks (e.g. in Germany and the United Kingdom). Some operators apply a VoIP surcharge, such as <lb/>Deutsche Telekom, 71 while some apply it to customers buying small volumes of data only, and some apply <lb/>no surcharge at all. 72 <lb/>Connecting directly to the visited network <lb/>Another possibility that might be explored, although no such activity has been recorded, is the <lb/>possibility of a customer being connected directly to the visited operator&apos;s network, without any roaming <lb/>agreement between the home and visited operator. The only relationship between the home operator and <lb/>the visited operators would be for billing purposes. Once the roaming carrier or visited operator has been <lb/>selected, the visited network would have to provide the visiting customer with an identity in its network, by <lb/>means of a new IMSI, via over-the-air SIM-card programming. The original IMSI would only be used <lb/>when incoming calls are received. This arrangement has many similarities with the one presented in the <lb/>last paragraphs of the section &quot; A WTO solution? &quot; . The main difference is that the visited network operator <lb/>would not have direct, regulated access to the home number. It would have to reach an agreement instead. <lb/>If such an arrangement were to be implemented: <lb/>• Calls made would be entirely billed by the visited operator at domestic rates (local calls at local <lb/>rates and calls back home or to third countries at international domestic rates).<lb/>• Received calls would be routed via the home operator to the visited network. MTRs (or, for some <lb/>countries, MSRN termination fees) plus a mark-up to provide for international transit costs would <lb/>then be applied.<lb/>The customer would then be billed by the home operator for the services provided by visited networks. <lb/>There would be no wholesale resale, but an agreement for customers to be billed on behalf of the visited <lb/>operator. An extra charge to provide for billing expenses would also be applied. <lb/>Potential challenges that may prevent such an implementation probably are the operator&apos;s willingness <lb/>to put them in place, bearing in mind the balance of potential customers to be gained and lost, and whether <lb/>it would fit into their existing business and commercial models. It is not clear to what extent such a <lb/>relationship would be against GSMA agreements, and it would need multi-IMSI SIM cards or over-the-air <lb/>programming of the customer&apos;s SIM-card. <lb/></body>

			<body>Consumer Awareness of Retail Charges <lb/>Transparency measures aimed at increasing awareness of roaming charges by consumers are an <lb/>important way of informing consumers about roaming charges and avoiding bill-shock. Contrary to price <lb/>regulations, transparency measures which inform consumers about the price of calls made and received, <lb/>SMS and data can hardly be contested by operators, although they entail a certain cost. They do not <lb/>address directly the problem of high roaming charges, but help protect and empower consumers. <lb/>In light of several surveys 73 that pointed out that a considerable number of European mobile roamers <lb/>were not aware of roaming charges, the EC decided to include some transparency measures as part of the <lb/>EU roaming regulation. These include: <lb/>• By SMS and free of charge, the customer will be automatically provided, with basic personalised <lb/>pricing information on roaming prices charged (including VAT), that apply to making and <lb/>receiving calls, sending SMS, and providing data roaming services.<lb/>• On request and free of charge, more detailed personalised pricing information on roaming charges <lb/>will be provided.<lb/>• Information about charges that apply to the use of data roaming services and, when appropriate, on <lb/>the risk of automatic and uncontrolled data roaming connection and downloads, explaining in a <lb/>clear way how to switch off these automatic data roaming connections.<lb/>• Notifications sent to roaming customers&apos; handsets or other devices, when data roaming services <lb/>have reached 80% of the agreed financial or volume limit (the default financial limit shall be close <lb/>to, but not exceed EUR 50 of outstanding charges per monthly billing period). When the limit is <lb/>reached, another notification shall indicate the procedure to be followed if the customer wishes to <lb/>continue the provision of data roaming services. If the customer declines or does not respond, the <lb/>home provider will cease to charge for and to provide the data roaming service.<lb/>• If the customer does not respond to the notification referred to above, the home provider will cease <lb/>to provide the data roaming service.<lb/>A new version of the guidelines issued by the ERG was released aiming at facilitating the implementation <lb/>of the Roaming Regulation, with particular attention to some operational issues regarding transparency <lb/>measures applied to the &quot; welcome message &quot; and to data communication services. <lb/>Similarly, the AREGNET agreement contained certain provisions on transparency for roaming <lb/>customers, including: <lb/>• Website on roaming tariffs, containing timely and updated data of all the regulated operators, in <lb/>Arabic and English.<lb/>• Information on tariffs via SMS, when a user connects to a network in a visited country.<lb/>These measures, unlike roaming price regulation, were approved by the Arab Telecommunications and <lb/>Information Council of Ministers. <lb/>The Australian Parliament&apos;s inquiry into international mobile roaming advised the Australian <lb/>Communications and Media Authority to facilitate a meeting of the Communications Alliance (industry <lb/>association) to discuss the development of a minimum standard for consumer information and awareness <lb/></body>

			<body>of roaming and potential costs. This recommendation was endorsed by the Government of Australia. In its <lb/>response, 74 , the Australian Government commits, in the framework of the review of the <lb/> &quot; Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code &quot; , scheduled to take place after May 2010, to encourage <lb/>the relevant parties to consider a minimum standard for consumer information and awareness, including <lb/>improving mechanisms to avoid &quot; bill-shock &quot; , and providing price information via SMS on arrival in <lb/>another country. <lb/>Similarly, a number of regional bodies have also proposed some measures on roaming tariff <lb/>transparency. APEC 75 has carried out two workshops within its liberalisation steering group (LSG). In <lb/>particular, 12 economies participated in 2008 in a survey 76 on IMRS. All of them stated that carriers <lb/>provide information on roaming charges on their websites, while only one (Hong-Kong, China) provides <lb/>data through an Agency. Five economies send SMS messages detailing prices on the visitor&apos;s arrival. Two <lb/>of them (Indonesia, the United States) have company brochures mailed to customers and provide <lb/>information through customer bills. The LSG 77 is also considering the development and release of <lb/>International Mobile Roaming Consumer Guidelines for the purpose of empowering consumers through <lb/>the provision of information on both pricing and substitute technologies. <lb/>CITEL (Inter-American Commission for Telecommunications), within the IIRSA (Initiative for the <lb/>Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America) framework, has also delivered interesting work on <lb/>IMRS. 78 At its meeting on &quot; International Roaming Services: Action Plan and lessons learnt &quot; 79 (CITEL <lb/>workshop/Second IIRSA Executive Technical Group), that took place on 4 May 2009, some proposals <lb/>were presented, to be included in the Action Plan of the Technical Group. The objective of one of them <lb/>was to achieve transparency of information for IMRS users, ensuring completeness, clarity, homogeneity <lb/>and timeliness of information, which would be implemented by designing a standard format with the <lb/>necessary information regarding services provided by each operator, facilitating comparison of prices and <lb/>service conditions between operators, and by publishing this information under the &quot; roaming &quot; section of <lb/>operators&apos; websites and the related regulatory authority. <lb/>Finally, the GSMA has also set up a website with information about roaming tariffs, perhaps as a <lb/>response to the increasing regulatory pressure by regulators and policy makers. This website includes <lb/>information on the latest price and transparency measures incorporating the new EU regulation <lb/>requirements, available directly from the individual operators. However, for most operators, the only link <lb/>provided is the home site of the operator, thus not compiling information directly on the GSMA site, but <lb/>rather serving as a list of links to European operators. 80 There is also some information on the definition of <lb/>voice, SMS and data roaming, and coverage maps. <lb/>There is widespread agreement on enforcing transparency measures that may allow consumers to <lb/>make informed decisions on roaming services. Although these measures might entail some extra cost, they <lb/>aim at increasing awareness and avoiding bill-shock phenomena. However, these measures should not be a <lb/>stand-alone initiative and should be complemented by information on substitutes and possible measures to <lb/>reach price levels that no longer harm consumers. This way, consumers will be more protected and <lb/>empowered, complaints against operators should decrease, and the overall image of the mobile industry <lb/>would be improved. <lb/>Temporary Number Portability <lb/>One of the underlying reasons for persistently high wholesale charges is the fact that roaming services <lb/>are not purchased independently, in that they are one element of a bundle that consists of domestic mobile <lb/>calls, SMS, handset subsidy, etc. That is why mobile providers have so far been able to keep roaming <lb/>charges high, as the price of roaming services is not taken into account in decision making when it comes <lb/>to choosing a mobile service provider, at least for the majority of the customer base, as the first OECD <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>report on IMRS points out. For these consumers, roaming services are not or are not likely to be a <lb/>significant proportion of their bills and demand for roaming services is likely to remain inelastic. Mobile <lb/>service providers have to a great extent chosen to keep roaming charges high taking advantage of the <lb/>situation and the low risk of losing a customer. <lb/>Temporary Number Portability (TNP) has been proposed as a mechanism to decouple the mobile <lb/>services bundle, allowing the consumer to choose a different provider. Should such a procedure be <lb/>implemented, mobile services consumers would be able to switch to a different provider only for a limited <lb/>period of time, and only for roaming services. The objective of TNP is to attain better contestability in the <lb/>market which should have beneficial effects on competition and lead to lower roaming prices. This <lb/>mechanism, however, should be put in place in the framework of a more general policy for price reduction <lb/>and promotion of competition. <lb/>In one of the recommendations 81 released by the Australian Parliament, it was recommended that the <lb/>Australian Communications and Media Authority develop, through the Communications Alliance, an <lb/>amendment to the Code on mobile number portability to allow temporary mobile portability for roaming <lb/>services. This would allow the customer to select the roaming plan offered by an Australian provider that <lb/>most suited their travel arrangements. <lb/>The Australian Government&apos;s Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy <lb/>responded to this report on 9 September 2009. 82 It did not agree with the Committee&apos;s recommendation to <lb/>allow temporary number portability for roaming services, on the grounds that new systems would need to <lb/>be designed in order to introduce temporary mobile number portability, since current systems are designed <lb/>for the purpose of permanent transfer of customers rather that temporary porting. In its view, these costs <lb/>may result in an increase in costs charged to Australian consumers. Significant technical barriers and <lb/>operational complexities involved with billing systems and agreements between carriers would therefore <lb/>prevent this implementation. <lb/>Mobile and fixed number portability has been developed in most OECD countries as a tool to foster <lb/>competition. Consumers may keep their numbers when switching providers. This lowers considerably the <lb/>barriers for consumers to take advantage of new tariff plans. It involves a number of technical and <lb/>operational arrangements in order to allow a customer to port within a few days. Distributed or centralised <lb/>databases have been put in place by operators and/or regulators to support the process. In some countries, <lb/>there is a number portability fee that is either paid by the user or included as a cost of the acquiring <lb/>operator. <lb/>The European Commission has included number portability as one of the key aspects of the reform of <lb/>the European Directives on Electronic Communications (Telecom Package), specifically in the aspect of <lb/>empowering consumers, 83 helping them switch providers more easily. Number portability is already a <lb/>common practice across the EU. In 2008 60.2 million EU mobile subscribers took advantage of number <lb/>portability, taking on average about 7.5 days for fixed and 8.5 days for mobile telephone numbers. <lb/>According to the European Commission, the most effective countries took between 1 and 3 days, while in <lb/>others it took up to 38 days for mobile numbers (Poland). According to the 14 th Implementation Report 84 of <lb/>the European Directives, 68.7% of Finnish subscribers have ported their numbers at least once, 39.97% in <lb/>Denmark and 35.45% in Spain. Some EU countries have no inter-operator charges for NP (Spain, Estonia, <lb/>Latvia and Lithuania), while in others it can be as high as EUR 22 (Germany), EUR 23 (Czech Republic), <lb/>EUR 33 (Slovak Republic) or EUR 45 (Malta). <lb/>The new European Telecom Directives include the requirement for a maximum time limit for the <lb/>effective porting of a number to be set at one working day. The amended Telecom Package, 85 which has <lb/></body>

			<page>36 <lb/></page>

			<body>been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 25 November 2009, aims inter alia to foster <lb/>competition through a faster and easier number portability procedure. <lb/>Whether the same procedure can be successfully applied to TNP, as the Australian Parliament <lb/>suggests, depends on a number of factors. Since the current arrangements allow for number portability in a <lb/>few days, there is no reason why this porting could not be adapted to the temporary purpose of roaming <lb/>services. The cost of adaptation, however, needs to be independently evaluated and an impact assessment <lb/>conducted. In some countries, portability procedures have changed during the last few years due to the <lb/>emergence of a considerable number of MVNOs that make a distributed model more costly to operate. <lb/>Portability registers and databases are often run by operators and are supervised by regulatory authorities <lb/>that set the rules to obey and some operational requirements. It is therefore up to NRAs and policy makers <lb/>to carry out a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate whether benefits offset costs if TNP is made available. <lb/>If TNP were to be enforced, it should be by means of regulatory obligations, meaning that both <lb/>leaving the original provider as well as switching back would be guaranteed by NRAs. Mobile providers <lb/>should then be obliged to keep the original contract conditions after the mobile customer is ported back. In <lb/>addition, there are two issues that may raise concerns during the time that the user is temporarily ported to <lb/>the roaming provider: monthly fees and engagement periods. NRAs enforcing TNP would have to set <lb/>conditions on whether the monthly fee (or fraction) has to be paid by recipient operators during the TNP <lb/>period or whether no fee should be levied. As for engagement periods, there is the question of how they are <lb/>counted. In principle, the time where the customer is ported to the roaming operator should not be counted <lb/>as contract duration. Handset use may also raise concerns, since many mobile markets are based on <lb/>terminal subsidies and handset lock and no third parties&apos; SIM card use is allowed. <lb/>Most post-paid mobile subscribers commit to long-term contracts to take advantage of cheaper rates. <lb/>Some of these contracts are often linked to terminal subsidies that have been very much appreciated by <lb/>consumers and, in some cases, have been the main drivers of the mobile services market and handset <lb/>manufacturing industry. In countries like Korea or Japan, for example, most subscribers sign up for two-<lb/>year periods and post-paid users are a majority of the subscriber base. As for pre-paid customers, some of <lb/>these issues would be somehow eased since there are neither engagement periods nor monthly fees, <lb/>although the question of handset use would remain. Thus, markets with a low proportion of post-paid <lb/>customers (Italy, Mexico, Turkey, Portugal) or without widespread long engagement obligations (e.g. <lb/>Denmark) should in principle pose fewer challenges to the enforcement of TNP. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1: % of pre-paid mobile subscribers by country <lb/>The enforcement of TNP obligations would give disruptive operators the opportunity to challenge <lb/>dominant players by short-term roaming offers. They would still face the constraint of possible high <lb/>wholesale roaming charges, as long as they are attached to the IOT negotiation framework, but it would <lb/>give way to interesting possibilities. <lb/>The initial proposal by the Australian Parliament involves further implications if TNP is not restricted <lb/>to roaming services and the subscriber uses domestic services while ported to the roaming operator. That <lb/>would imply the use of two operators, with billing issues that would have to be resolved. If the subscriber <lb/>is ported only for the time abroad and does not make use of domestic services, these issues would be <lb/>considerably easier to deal with. <lb/>NRAs and policy makers should conduct a cost-benefit assessment of the costs involved in terms of <lb/>operational arrangements, regulatory enforcement and transition costs if TNP was to be implemented. <lb/>Potential benefits should be assessed, as well as the likelihood of disruptive operators taking advantage of <lb/>these instruments, and not choosing to keep high roaming prices and take advantage of low-elasticity <lb/>customers. Clearly, providing customers with an easy TNP procedure and raising awareness would also <lb/>play a role in TNP enforcement and success. <lb/>Consumer Awareness of Substitutes <lb/>As a complement to the suggested measures on consumer awareness of roaming prices, countries <lb/>should encourage awareness of substitutes by consumers. This would enable consumers to make choices <lb/>about whether they want to use roaming services. Information should be provided on the process and <lb/>requirements to purchase a local SIM-card, the existence of providers of multi-country SIM-cards or <lb/> &quot; global SIM-cards &quot; , the use of Wi-Fi access to place international calls, and other alternatives such as <lb/>fixed-line international and local calls, etc., which were analysed in depth in the first OECD report on <lb/>IMRS. <lb/>Australia has been very active in trying to enforce obligation regarding knowledge of substitutes. In <lb/>fact, one of the recommendations made by the Parliament and endorsed by the government advocated the <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>38 <lb/></page>

			<body>inclusion of information on alternatives to roaming. These alternatives should include international calling <lb/>cards, SMS, use of local networks, e-mail and use of hotel telephones. Accordingly, the Australian <lb/>Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has added the list of recommended alternatives to their <lb/>fact sheet on International mobile roaming, 86 and this information will also include VoIP services. It agrees <lb/>that there are some barriers (high data roaming charges, need for a VoIP enabled handset) to the use of <lb/>VoIP but believes that there is scope for providing consumers with information about VoIP as an <lb/>alternative. <lb/>Some work on roaming substitutes is being undertaken by the International Roaming Project Team of <lb/>the ERG, namely in its analysis of consumer awareness of roaming prices. This group is due to provide the <lb/>European Commission with an interim report by mid-2010. <lb/>Regarding the use of a local SIM-card, in many countries most handsets are SIM-locked and only the <lb/>home operator&apos;s SIM-card may be inserted. Handset subsidies (and the handset lock involved) have proved <lb/>to be very successful commercial strategies, since consumers may update their handset for a low, one-off <lb/>cost. Although countries such as Belgium forbid handset locking, it is a widespread practice for many <lb/>others (France, Japan, Korea, Spain). However, the Belgian anti-bundling law has been brought before the <lb/>European Court of Justice, which found on 23 April 2009 that these laws are forbidden under Directive <lb/>2005/29/EC. That could mean the beginning of SIM-locked handset offers in Belgium. 87 <lb/>Consumer Awareness of Dual Sim-Card Handsets <lb/>Dual SIM-card handsets are an option for those who are willing to purchase a local SIM-card while in <lb/>a foreign country. They may just be addressed to a minority of users, since there are apparently few <lb/>consumers that have the manual proficiency or knowledge to purchase a local SIM-card. Some of the <lb/>existing dual SIM-card handsets enable dual services to be active at the same time, which would enable <lb/>them to be still able to receive calls, or at least to check who has called, while making local calls using a <lb/>local SIM-card. <lb/>Dual SIM-card handsets have been on the market for some years now, 88 although they still represent a <lb/>small niche market, despite growth in some developing countries like China and India. 89 Those handsets <lb/>are interesting for those who want to combine work and personal phones and they are very much adapted <lb/>to international travellers. <lb/>NRAs, consumer protection authorities or manufacturers should inform consumers about the <lb/>possibility of purchasing a dual SIM-card handset, which may be useful for frequent roamers. Uptake of <lb/>these handsets by consumers may face similar challenges as those for uptake of substitutes: many operators <lb/>base their business models on handset subsidy and SIM-lock, which prevents the insertion of another SIM-<lb/>card in the handset. This has proved to be a commercial strategy greatly appreciated by consumers, since it <lb/>allows them to enjoy new handsets without purchasing them directly, and it helps to stimulate the handset <lb/>industry as well. <lb/>Possible Outcomes and Impacts <lb/>According to some stakeholders, roaming regulation would have some important impacts on other <lb/>services, namely price increases in response to regulated price caps for roaming. This is known as <lb/>waterbed effects. That means that, at least where price cuts are not compensated by increased traffic <lb/>volumes, operators may try to recover lost profits by increasing the price of other services, or not <lb/>decreasing prices as much as they would have otherwise. The affected services may be those included in <lb/>the mobile services bundle, or other services such as non-regulated wholesale roaming prices <lb/>(e.g. wholesale prices faced by extra-EU operators). The issue of waterbed effects has been addressed by <lb/></body>

			<body>academic literature and has been a constant claim of some industry players who argue that lost profits <lb/>would be recovered elsewhere anyway. <lb/>Some data coming from the ERG reports will be presented, trying to shed some light on demand <lb/>elasticity of roaming services. This issue has indeed been addressed in the discussions at the European <lb/>level, where some estimates have been made to evaluate welfare losses and gains resulting from regulating <lb/>roaming prices. As demand elasticity is a key issue to draw these estimates, some data have been provided <lb/>in the Annex below. <lb/>Finally, another potential effect caused by roaming regulation would be that the loss of benefits <lb/>involved would undermine investment by operators, in that they would no longer find incentives to invest <lb/>if potential profits are cut by regulation. However, there is no evidence that this has occurred, or whether <lb/>profits made from a non-competitive market would lead to efficient investment in the long run. Any <lb/>potential profit loss by operators might discourage investments, if significant enough, although it is clear <lb/>that a possible price regulation is not the only factor for investment decisions. <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX I – WATERBED EFFECTS, ELASTICITY AND IMPACT ON INVESTMENTS <lb/>Waterbed Effects and/or Tariff Rebalancing <lb/>Waterbed effects or retail tariff rebalancing and their application to IMRS have always been a <lb/>controversial issue when assessing the impact of price regulation. Since IMRS are sold in a bundle, it <lb/>seems possible that prices rebalance across services, allowing operators to either maintain the current level <lb/>of revenues, or experience reductions which were less than what would have been implied by reductions in <lb/>the directly affected price in the mobile bundle. Waterbed effects have also been a constant argument used <lb/>by operators to persuade authorities not to regulate IMRC. 90 Large operators have always argued that <lb/>capping retail roaming services would force them to increase the price of domestic services, while others <lb/>say that the retail price of domestic services is set by competitive forces, which would remain stable if <lb/>roaming prices are capped. As an example, domestic MVNOs, which normally have little roaming <lb/>revenues, would constrain domestic operators to keep their domestic prices down, thus putting competitive <lb/>pressure on them. <lb/>There are several waterbed effects to be considered. Firstly, the impact on domestic prices of a <lb/>decrease in mobile roaming revenues. Secondly, as Australian authorities have sometimes argued, regional <lb/>water-bedding effects, that is, operators in a region, say, Europe, increase their wholesale rates to extra-<lb/>regional operators, say Australian, in response to having their wholesale and retail roaming revenues <lb/>capped for intra-European roaming, namely after the enforcement of the EU regulation. Again, a <lb/>distinction should be made between different types of operators, since operators with small roaming <lb/>revenues would suffer much smaller waterbed effects. <lb/>The main challenge in assessing waterbed effects is the lack of empirical evidence and of a <lb/>counterfactual. No evidence can be found showing that price increases are due to this phenomenon, or that <lb/>prices would have decreased instead of remaining stable or would have further decreased if waterbed <lb/>effects were not present. This is why it cannot be assumed that there is no waterbed effect only by the fact <lb/>there has been no price increase in other services of the mobile bundle. <lb/>Excluding the existence of waterbed effects may, to some extent, imply that any taxes levied on <lb/>operators would have no effects on the competitive equilibrium and would not result in a price increase. In <lb/>competitive equilibrium, economic profits (once a reasonable return is guaranteed) are zero, so any <lb/>increase in costs that operators incur would result in a price increase and a change of the competitive <lb/>equilibrium. Retail mobile markets (the market is defined as a bundle of calls, handset subsidy, SMS, <lb/>roaming services, etc.) are considered generally competitive, although the extent to which they are <lb/>competitive may differ across countries. Changes in profits caused by price regulation, discipline placed on <lb/>profits as a result of the level of competition, as well as different demand price-elasticities of the mobile <lb/>services within the bundle, potentially involve retail price rebalancing. However, if revenue lost by <lb/>roaming regulations were to be easily recovered by an increase in domestic prices, 91 it is hard to understand <lb/>the strong opposition to the EU regulation by mobile operators, apart from a principle-based objection to <lb/>increased regulation of the sector and the associated regulatory burden. <lb/>Additionally, since roaming heavy-users are a minority in most countries, any potential waterbed <lb/>effects are likely to be low, since the roaming market represents a low share of revenues (around 5-10%) <lb/>although a potentially higher share of profits. <lb/></body>

			<body>One of the few empirical studies on the waterbed effect in mobile telephony was conducted by <lb/>Genakos and Valletti (2009). 92 Although it is focused on studying waterbed effects as a result of a <lb/>reduction of mobile termination rates, it advocates that this approach can be extrapolated to IMRS. The <lb/>study analyses the impact of fixed-to-mobile termination rate regulation on prices and profit margins on a <lb/>newly constructed dataset of mobile operators across more than 20 countries during the last decade. They <lb/>find a high waterbed effect but not full. A stronger waterbed effect exists the more intense competition is in <lb/>markets with high levels of market penetration and high termination rates. Although the issue is not <lb/>examined, they agree that similar conclusions can be drawn for waterbed effects caused by IMRS price <lb/>regulation. <lb/>Schiff 93 (2008) also acknowledges the existence of waterbed effects for a multi-product firm, and <lb/>regulation of any one price will cause changes in the other price(s) set by the firm as a result of its profit-<lb/>maximising behaviour. In his view, welfare analysis of any proposed regulation must take into account <lb/>these effects. According to Schiff, if demands and costs of the regulated and unregulated products are <lb/>independent (in that the price of the regulated product does not affect marginal revenues or marginal costs <lb/>of the unregulated products) then rational firms will not typically change unregulated prices, no matter how <lb/>severe the regulation is. The exception is if firms are not able to cover fixed costs and some firms leave the <lb/>industry, reducing the intensity of competition and allowing unregulated prices to rise. The effect is also <lb/>likely to exist with non-linear pricing, if there is a zero-profit constraint or a global price-cap and there is a <lb/>common fixed cost. <lb/>In its 2007 Statement 94 and 2009 Consultation 95 on mobile call termination (MCT), the United <lb/>Kingdom&apos;s regulator Ofcom considered the existence of the waterbed effect in its mobile market. MNOs <lb/>had argued that any excess profit in MCT would be competed away at the retail level through lower retail <lb/>subscription prices (e.g. lower subscription charges and larger handset subsidies). In the context of MCTs, <lb/>Ofcom considered that a significant waterbed effect is likely, given that retail competition in mobile <lb/>services is strong, but that it is unlikely to be complete. However, given the lack of conclusive evidence, <lb/>Ofcom decided not to rely heavily on an assumption of an incomplete waterbed effect when determining <lb/>what conditions should be imposed on MNOs to address the detriment arising from excessive MCT <lb/>charges, absent regulation of mobile termination rates. It also considered that, even if the waterbed effect <lb/>were fully effective and MNOs did not make excessive profits from setting excessive MCT charges, <lb/>excessive MCT charges may give rise to other detriments such as distortions of consumer choice and <lb/>potential competitive distortions. <lb/>The waterbed effect is dependent on the share of roaming profits relative to total mobile profits, <lb/>competition conditions, mobile penetration, etc. Because of the relatively small size of roaming profits <lb/>relative to total profits (despite the arguably high profitability of roaming services), it is likely that the <lb/>waterbed effect resulting from lowering roaming charges would be minimal. In addition, empirical price <lb/>data are difficult to analyse, since they are subject to a number of factors: demand changes, overall <lb/>decreasing mobile prices, changes in competition conditions and/or regulatory constraints. Any attempt to <lb/>regulate roaming prices must be aware of these effects and should bear in mind that they are likely to <lb/>distort impact assessments. <lb/>Internationally, some say that the EU IMRC reduction may have lead European operators to increase <lb/>wholesale roaming charges faced by non-European providers. However, no evidence has been found to <lb/>draw a conclusion on the behaviour of European wholesale roaming providers. In some cases, operators <lb/>include EU neighbouring countries such as Switzerland or Croatia in the EU-tariff zone. IOTs, as <lb/>explained before, may increase over time. KPMG, in its report 96 commissioned by the Australian <lb/>Government, cites recent expert reports 97 and media articles 98 that suggest that in response to retail price <lb/>capping regulation implemented across EU countries, EU carriers have raised the wholesale roaming rates <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)12/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<body>they charge non-EU carriers, as a type of waterbed effect. The report concludes that it is likely that high <lb/>relative costs of roaming to and from the EU can be attributed to EU carrier increases. <lb/>Finally, a distinction should also be made among net out-payers and net recipient roaming operators. <lb/>Operators in tourist destinations may well be more touched by a regulatory cap on wholesale prices, but <lb/>may not be so concerned by a retail cap. They may need to invest in building-up networks for <lb/>occasional/seasonal use by tourists in order to serve roaming customers, and decreasing wholesale <lb/>revenues are likely to reduce the incentive to do so or to make network upgrades in these areas. On the <lb/>other hand, tourist-emitter countries will pay lower wholesale charges to recipient operators but would face <lb/>lower retail revenues. The final outcome of these two opposite effects will depend on the wholesale-retail <lb/>margin, customer price elasticity, etc. <lb/>Elasticity-Volume Increases <lb/>As pointed out in the previous OECD report &quot; International Mobile Roaming Charges in the OECD <lb/>area &quot; , price-elasticity of roaming services is not easy to assess. The European Commission estimated an <lb/>elasticity range from -0.50 to -1.2 when evaluating welfare impacts of the roaming regulation, whereas the <lb/>European Parliament&apos;s commissioned study 99 estimated it to be between -0.35 and -0.44. No clear evidence <lb/>of elasticity was found by the ERG benchmark data report 100 regarding the period April 2007 to September <lb/>2008: &quot; A direct comparison of the developments in the volumes of regulated voice services and <lb/>unregulated SMS services (for which prices have remained static) reveals a very similar trend. It is not <lb/>clear how to interpret this and ERG is reluctant to draw definitive conclusions at this stage. It could imply <lb/>that the assumption that some had made that price reductions would stimulate large increases in volumes <lb/>does not hold water. On the other hand, the rise in SMS roaming volumes could also be seen as a natural <lb/>consequence of the still increasing domestic SMS volumes in many member states &quot; . In spring 2010, the <lb/>ERG will publish a more detailed report, meant to serve as an empirical reference for the Commission to <lb/>produce an interim report on the EU Roaming Regulation by June 2010, which will include a demand <lb/>elasticity assessment. <lb/>The most recently released ERG data benchmark report 101 (October 2008-March 2009) includes some <lb/>data on the variations of volumes and prices for calls made and received and for SMS sent in the EU/EEA <lb/>area after the enforcement of the roaming regulation. This report does not draw any conclusion as to <lb/>whether roaming demand is elastic or not. It is difficult to make any estimates on the issue, since there <lb/>aremany effects that may have an impact on the figures, such as seasonal demand, service substitution <lb/>(e.g. calls received and made, calls made and SMS, etc.), and the wider economic situation (e.g. tourist <lb/>numbers), and although the data are provided here, it is difficult to interpret them. <lb/>However, we include here some of the data provided by the ERG data benchmark report, referring to <lb/>average data in the EU/EEA area. <lb/></body>

If revenues are reduced, especially those that risky investments yield, there will be no <lb/>incentive for further investments. 102 It is noteworthy that such statements are usually made by <lb/>telecommunications providers in response to most of the regulatory interventions that may harm their <lb/>profitability. Ideally, the higher the revenues made by operators, the higher the incentive for investments, <lb/>regardless of impact on competition, consumer choice, etc. Telefonica recently announced that the impact <lb/>of the new roaming and mobile termination rates regulation was around EUR 6 billion and EUR 34 billion <lb/>respectively. That would mean an investment cut of EUR 6 billion. 103 These calculations start from the <lb/>assumption of inelastic roaming demand. <lb/>Operators use a complex set of criteria when making their investment decision. Expected return is <lb/>clearly one of the main important drivers of investment and any foreseen reduction in expected revenues <lb/>will influence it. Regulatory intervention aiming at increasing competition or protecting consumers is very <lb/>likely to have an impact on operators&apos; revenues, especially on bigger players, and might cut down <lb/>investments. Another issue to be discussed is whether these profits lead to efficient investment in the long <lb/>run. However, the share of roaming revenues is a relatively small piece of the mobile telecommunications <lb/>market, which will make any impact limited. Any regulatory decision involves a trade-off between <lb/>consumer choice, competition evolution, investment, etc. All these factors should always be taken into <lb/>account by regulators and policy makers. <lb/>As for investments in infrastructure to provide roaming services (network upgrades), they will be <lb/>needed more in areas with a heavy affluence of foreign visitors (tourist resorts, airports, etc.), and net-<lb/>recipient operators will be more affected by them. Clearly, high wholesale rates would help net-recipient <lb/>operators pay-off their investments in network upgrades for foreign visitors, as has been pointed out before. <lb/></body>
