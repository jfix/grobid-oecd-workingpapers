			<p>The chemicals industry has a long history of innovation as &quot; the first science-based industry &quot; . It<lb/> occupies a large part of international trade and has continuously been the subject of multilateral trade<lb/> negotiations. It is undergoing a major transformation with the rise of emerging economies and regulatory<lb/> challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>World trade in the chemicals sector more than trebled between 1995 and 2008, particularly just<lb/> after 2001. While high income countries represent the majority of world trade, low and middle income<lb/> countries are steadily gaining importance, and South-South trade has recorded higher growth rates than<lb/> other income group pairs. Emerging economies, such as China, are now among the major traders in this<lb/> sector. Three quarters of world trade in the chemicals sector is in intermediate goods, and consumer<lb/> chemicals and pharmaceuticals make up the rest. Tariffs have been reduced substantially over the same<lb/> period, but their elimination remains as a subject in the current multilateral negotiations.<lb/> Different sub-segments of the industry, i.e. basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals<lb/> and consumer chemicals all have very diverse innovation characteristics. Basic industrial chemicals have<lb/> limited opportunities to introduce new products and compete mainly on costs, whereas product innovation,<lb/> responding to evolving customer needs transmitted through supply chains, is essential for speciality and<lb/> fine chemicals. Process innovation is important for both of these sub-sectors to reduce costs, to improve<lb/> sustainability (e.g. industrial biotechnology) or to pursue differentiation. For consumer chemicals<lb/> introduction of new products and marketing approaches is the key. These different features of those sub-<lb/>segments offer diverse channels through which trade affects innovation in the chemicals sector. First, the<lb/> transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through technology<lb/> licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry, and the<lb/> specialised engineering firms (SEFs) have played a unique role, especially in basic industrial chemicals.<lb/> Second, product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals contributes to innovation in downstream<lb/> sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such innovations across borders. Thirdly, as a<lb/> consequence of the wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology leaders in developed<lb/> countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which induces further<lb/> innovation. Fourth, foreign contacts through exports can give suppliers innovative ideas. The increasing<lb/> strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it also offers opportunities for innovation. Finally, joint<lb/> ventures and cross border M&amp;A also function as channels of technology transfer.<lb/></p>

			<p>The chemicals sector is heavily regulated both domestically and internationally, primarily for health,<lb/> safety and environmental reasons. Under WTO rules, regulations may be considered legitimate if certain<lb/> conditions are met. Many domestic regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure<lb/> provided in the TBT Agreement, and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals<lb/> sector. The impact of regulation on innovation can go either way; on one hand, regulation imposes extra<lb/> cost and time burdens and diverts resources away from innovation, but on the other hand, environmental<lb/> regulation can induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency. The actual impact of regulation<lb/> on innovation is likely to be specific to the regulatory design and to the products and segments of the<lb/> industry. The impact of recently introduced REACH legislation in the EU has been much discussed both in<lb/> the legislative process within the EU and in international forums including the WTO. Beyond the EU,<lb/> many major players in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and<lb/> to extend regulatory coverage to existing chemicals. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they<lb/> are still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the<lb/> chemicals sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions<lb/> and as a major contributor to delivering solutions to combat climate change. Technological solutions to<lb/> reduce reliance on fossil fuels by the chemicals sector are being sought, and chemical products are<lb/> essential for greenhouse gas reduction in downstream industries. Further trade liberalisation can play an<lb/> important role to accelerate the diffusion of products and technologies that contribute to climate change<lb/> mitigation.<lb/> Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease of<lb/> producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the<lb/> chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively to protect intellectual<lb/> property, the choice depending on the nature of the technology and company strategy. Patents have been<lb/> instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing. The practice of co-patenting is generally<lb/> correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that collaborative efforts in innovation foster trade<lb/> flows, or that trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing. Infringement of<lb/> intellectual property continues to be a major problem resulting in large losses to the intellectual property<lb/> holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect their<lb/> intellectual property, over and above efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by the<lb/> Chinese government. In addition, counterfeiting of chemical products (e.g. fertilisers and pesticides),<lb/> which is often difficult to detect, can have serious consequences for the environment, health and safety.<lb/> During the recent financial crisis, the chemicals industry has been no exception in experiencing a<lb/> decline in trade. Although it is considered that the initial fear of possible serious protectionist reactions has<lb/> not materialised, chemicals and plastics are among the most affected industries by recently introduced<lb/> trade-related measures. The recent developments underline the importance of the monitoring activities to<lb/> ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Development Round.<lb/></p>

			<head>I.<lb/> Introduction<lb/> 1. Background and the purpose of the study<lb/></head>

			<p>1.<lb/> The Trade Committee&apos;s work on Trade and Innovation in 2007-2008 (OECD, 2008a) highlighted<lb/> various linkages between trade and innovation, drawing on case studies of various sectors in countries at<lb/> different levels of development. Building on this, a first sectoral study has been undertaken focusing on the<lb/> information and communication technology (ICT) sector. 1 This second sectoral study focuses on the<lb/> chemicals sector.<lb/> 2.<lb/> There are several reasons for the choice of this sector. First, the chemicals sector (HS Chapters<lb/> 28-39) occupies over 11% of the world trade, and it has been a specific subject of multilateral trade<lb/> negotiations. Second, it has a long tradition of innovation as &quot; the first science-based industry &quot; , and<lb/> development and diffusion of technology has played an essential role in shaping the industry. Moreover,<lb/> emerging economies and major regulatory issues relating particularly to health, safety and environment are<lb/> changing the industry. Thus, there are unique issues to explore in the chemicals sector in relation to trade<lb/> and innovation.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> This paper is in five sections. The remainder of this section briefly introduces the concept of<lb/> innovation and its contribution to trade, and discusses the scope of the chemicals sector covered in this<lb/> paper. Section II reviews the evolution of trade and tariff profiles of the sector over the past ten years.<lb/> Section III examines trade and innovation linkages focusing on three chemicals sub-sectors. Section IV<lb/> discusses trade-related policy measures in the chemicals sector, and Section V concludes.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Trade and innovation: an overview<lb/> i) Innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>4.<lb/> OECD (2005, p.46) ( &quot; the Oslo Manual &quot; ) 2 defines an innovation as the implementation of a new<lb/> or significantly improved product (good or services), or process, a new marketing method, or a new<lb/> organisational method in business practices, workplace organisation or external relations (. It is a<lb/> continuous process that involves multiple aspects of firm activities.<lb/> 5.<lb/> Four types of innovations are distinguished: product innovations, process innovations, marketing<lb/> innovations and organisational innovations. A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service<lb/> that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. A process<lb/> innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. A<lb/> marketing innovation is the implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in<lb/> product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing. An organisational<lb/> innovation is the implementation of a new organisational method in the firm&apos;s business practices,<lb/> workplace organisation or external relations. (Oslo Manual, pp.47-51) All innovations must contain a<lb/> degree of novelty, which can be new to the firm, new to the market or new to the world (ibid, p</p>

			<table>.57).<lb/> *This study is prepared with a contribution from Paul Wright, external consultant to this study.<lb/> 1 .<lb/> &quot; Trade in ICT and its contribution to trade and innovation &quot; , [TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART1;<lb/> TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART1/ANN and TAD/TC/WP(2009)11/PART2]<lb/> 2<lb/> The Oslo manual presents guidelines for collecting data on the general process of innovation, the<lb/> implementation of innovations, the factors that influence innovation activities, and the outcomes of<lb/> innovation. (Oslo Manual, p.15)<lb/></table>

			<head>ii) Contribution of trade to innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>6.<lb/> Just as the concept of an innovation is multifaceted, the contribution of trade to innovation<lb/> involves various channels. 3 As highlighted in OECD (2008a), technologies can move across borders<lb/> through trade and investment as well as through licensing. Imports of capital goods are an important<lb/> conduit for technology transfer as foreign-produced machinery often contains more technology than<lb/> domestic machinery, especially in developing countries. Foreign direct investment also plays a key role in<lb/> technology transfer and innovation. Multinational companies tend to innovate more than domestic<lb/> companies, and there is also a growing recognition that internationalising production can be a way of<lb/> gaining access to expertise and techniques that are complementary to a company&apos;s in-house assets. Second,<lb/> imports and foreign direct investment both increase competition for domestic industries, which creates an<lb/> incentive for firms to innovate in order to withstand competitive pressure. Empirical evidence suggests that,<lb/> in high-technology industries, levels of innovation fall more rapidly when there is less competition. Third,<lb/> globalisation of value chains, which itself is a type of innovation, may induce participating firms to<lb/> improve efficiency in individual activities, to change their mix of activities, or to try to innovate by moving<lb/> into another value chain (OECD (2008a), pp.14-42).<lb/> 7.<lb/> Openness to trade is, needless to say, not an instrument specifically designed to foster innovation,<lb/> but it is one element of the framework conditions that affects broader aspects of the economy. As often<lb/> emphasised, openness to trade (or more generally the right framework condition) on its own does not<lb/> ensure innovation (or other desirable economic outcomes), 4 and given the increasingly central role of<lb/> innovation in delivering a wide range of economic and social objectives, a &quot; whole-of-government &quot;<lb/> approach to policies for innovation is needed (OECD, 2010a). Nevertheless, as summarised above,<lb/> openness to trade is an essential condition that facilitates, or enables, diffusion of technologies for a<lb/> broader range of firms across the border to take up and innovate, and gives the right incentive for firms to<lb/> innovate. This study examines how these channels work in the chemicals sector.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. The scope of the chemicals sector and the nature of innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>8.<lb/> The chemicals sector comprises a series of diverse and inter-related sub-sectors covering a wide<lb/> range of technologies and processes. The output of the industry is mostly used by other companies as<lb/> inputs, but it also covers finished goods used by consumers. Chemical inputs are essential to many<lb/> different industries, not only to the chemical industry itself, or to other manufacturing industries such as<lb/> automotives, electronics and textiles, but also to agriculture and services. 5 In order to properly take into<lb/> account the diversity of this sector, it is useful to introduce certain sub-groupings within the industry. For<lb/> this purpose, this paper makes reference to &quot; basic industrial chemicals &quot; , &quot; speciality and fine chemicals &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; and &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; as sub-sectors. 6 Basic industrial chemicals cover inorganic<lb/> and organic chemicals as well as petrochemicals and fertilisers, which are typically produced on a large<lb/> scale. Speciality and fine chemicals are medium to high value products and produced on a smaller scale.<lb/></p>

			<table>See OECD (2008a), Tables 1 and 2.<lb/> 4<lb/> Speeches by Pascal Lamy, Director General of the WTO, &quot; Facts and Fictions in International Trade<lb/> Economics &quot; (12 April 2010, at the Paris School of Economics), &quot; Reconciling America with an open<lb/> trading system &quot; (24 April 2009, in Washington, D.C.),<lb/> 5<lb/> CEFIC (2009), p.8; ICCA (2005), p.4. In one estimate, 96% of manufactured goods have a direct nexus to<lb/> the chemicals sector (Durbin, 2009).<lb/> 6<lb/> HLG (2009) uses largely similar divisions: petrochemicals, basic inorganics and polymers; speciality<lb/> chemicals; and consumer chemicals (pp.6-7). Thomson Reuters Business Classification divides Chemicals<lb/> (under Basic Materials) into Commodity Chemicals, Agricultural Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals and<lb/> Diversified Chemicals. See also Swift (1999), p.33; OECD (2001), p.10.<lb/> They include paints and pigments, industrial gasses, sealants and adhesives and catalysts, but some organic<lb/> chemicals and plastics can also belong to this category. Consumer chemicals are in general formulated<lb/> products such as soap, detergents and cosmetics. Together (including pharmaceuticals) they nearly<lb/> correspond to the coverage of the Chemicals Tariff Harmonization Agreement (CTHA) in the Uruguay<lb/> Round.<lb/></table>

			<p>9.<lb/> It should be noted that the boundaries of the sub-sectors are fluid and not always clear-cut, and<lb/> statistics are not necessarily suited to capturing these different segments (<ref type="biblio">Swift (1999)</ref>, p.33). Adding to<lb/> this, &quot; chemicals &quot; in different studies may actually refer to a varying scope of products; in particular,<lb/> pharmaceuticals are often, but not always, treated as a separate industry, and consumer chemicals are<lb/> sometimes excluded, either explicitly or implicitly. 7 This paper does not specifically focus on<lb/> pharmaceuticals in its analysis of trade and innovation linkage in Sections III and IV, since it is quite<lb/> distinct in terms of both trade and innovation performances (see Section II and Section III.1) and may well<lb/> merit a specific study in its own right. 8<lb/></p>

			<table>II.<lb/> Trade and tariffs in the chemicals sector<lb/> 1. Evolution of trade 9<lb/> 10.<lb/> World trade in the chemicals sector (defined as HS Chapters 28 to 39 in this Section; 10 see<lb/> Table 1 for descriptions) more than trebled between 1995 and 2008 (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). While high income<lb/> countries (HICs) have the largest share in world trade, low and middle income countries (LMICs) have<lb/> been steadily gaining market share during this period. Taking a closer look at the differences by sub-sector<lb/> and by income group provides further insight. First, whereas the annual growth rates in chemicals<lb/> (excluding pharmaceuticals) have been similar to those in total merchandise trade, the growth rates in<lb/> pharmaceuticals (Chapter 30) have been quite different. 11 The growth in pharmaceuticals was notably<lb/> higher in HICs, compared with other HS Chapters. In contrast, the growth in fertilisers (Chapter 31) was<lb/> particularly higher in LMICs (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Second, in terms of levels of trade, there is a high concentration<lb/> on organic chemicals and plastics (HS Chapters 29 and 39; generally considered basic industrial<lb/> chemicals), followed by pharmaceuticals, which together account for 70% of trade in chemicals (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/> The composition of trade is different between the HICs and the LMICs, with trade in pharmaceuticals<lb/> strongly concentrated in the former, with inorganic chemicals and fertilisers more concentrated in the latter<lb/> group.<lb/> 11.<lb/> Trade in chemicals between LMICs (South-South trade) has been low but steadily increasing<lb/> from 5% in 1995 to close to 10% in 2008; in turn, the share of trade between HICs, while still dominant,<lb/> has gradually declined from over 70% to 60% during the same period (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Trade between LMICs<lb/> has recorded faster overall growth in the chemicals than other income group pairs during the period, with<lb/> the notable exception of pharmaceuticals. Plastics and organic chemicals together account for 40-50% of<lb/> increased growth after 2001 across different income group pairs, while pharmaceuticals was by far the<lb/> 7<lb/></p>

			<table>See e.g. Swift (1999), p.33 (explicitly excludes consumer products from the discussion); Thomson Reuters<lb/> Business Classification (establishes Personal &amp; Household Products separate from chemicals).<lb/> 8<lb/> See e.g. OECD (2006).<lb/> 9<lb/> See Appendix 1 for technical details of the data.<lb/> 10<lb/> This coverage is in reference to the CTHA. However, it contains some headings covered by the Agreement<lb/> on Agriculture thus not covered by the CTHA or current proposal on liberalisation of tariffs in chemicals<lb/> sector in the Doha round.<lb/> 11<lb/> WTO (2005a), pp.17-18 investigates into the possible reasons for sharp growth of trade in pharmaceutical<lb/> sector, and it attributes to strong demand and industrial restructuring as a major factor.<lb/></table>

			<p>largest contributor to trade between HICs. Pharmaceuticals are also the largest trading item between HICs,<lb/> while trade in fertilisers is mainly between LMICs. The largest trade item between the two income groups<lb/> is plastics, followed by organic chemicals.<lb/> 12.<lb/> The largest traders are the EU (external trade as a group), Germany and the United States,<lb/> followed by Belgium, France and China (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Here again, significant acceleration of growth in the<lb/> 2000s can be seen across countries. The composition of exports varies considerably between countries;<lb/> many OECD countries have high shares in pharmaceuticals (except Japan and Korea) alongside India,<lb/> while many East Asian economies (Korea; Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong, China) are more specialised in<lb/> plastics.<lb/> 13.<lb/> Classifying in terms of end use, intermediate goods (industry supplies and others) make up for<lb/> three-quarters of trade (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). This concentration in intermediate goods is even higher for the LMICs.<lb/> The most noticeable change between 2000 and 2007 was the increase in the share of pharmaceuticals,<lb/> especially in the HICs. Despite a significant increase in the absolute value of trade in other types of<lb/> chemicals, the shares of intermediate goods (except exports from the LMICs) and consumer chemicals<lb/> (other than pharmaceuticals; e.g. perfume, cosmetics, soap and plastic articles) declined during this period.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Tariff profiles in the chemicals sector<lb/></head>

			<p>14.<lb/> Tariff rates have been coming down since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(a)).<lb/> The average MFN applied tariffs on chemicals by the original CTHA (Chemicals Tariff Harmonization<lb/> Agreement) participants are about 2%, and non-participants have also reduced their rates from over 10% to<lb/> single digits. This reduction is not necessarily due to the implementation of commitments under the WTO<lb/> (Uruguay Round commitment or accession commitment) but includes unilateral tariff reduction, especially<lb/> by non-CTHA participants. Therefore, despite a certain degree of convergence of tariff rates across<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<p>Although this structure does not precisely correspond to the sub-groupings used in this paper, CEFIC<lb/> (2009), p.18, uses the following categorisation: &quot; basic inorganic &quot; (28, 31), &quot; petrochemicals (29), polymers<lb/> (39, 54, 55), &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; (30), &quot; specialty chemicals &quot; (32, 35, 38) and &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; (33, 34).<lb/> countries, levels of WTO bound rates in non-participants are considerably higher than other groups (<ref type="figure">Figure<lb/> 7</ref>(b)). Tariff reduction has taken place across different HS Chapters, but tariff rates are generally lower for<lb/> basic chemicals (Chapters 28-29) and higher for more highly processed chemical products (Chapters 33-36)<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). 13 This reflects the structure of CTHA, but it is also the case with non-participants.<lb/> 15.<lb/> An estimate of the amount of duties collected on imports shows that the largest amount is<lb/> collected by non-CTHA participants, despite tariff reductions in recent years (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). It also shows that<lb/> the duty collection by original CTHA participants and new WTO members also remains substantial, due to<lb/> large import value as well as to the remaining tariffs. It is worth noting, however, that whereas tariffs for<lb/> CTHA participants are bound at levels close to applied tariffs, tariffs for non-CTHA participants are bound<lb/> at much higher levels and can be raised by their policy decisions.<lb/> 16.<lb/> A breakdown into HS Chapters shows that plastics represent the largest share of duty collection,<lb/> followed by organic chemicals. The share of pharmaceuticals is significantly higher in non-CTHA<lb/> countries (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 1. The Chemicals Sector and Multilateral Trade Negotiations<lb/></head>

			<p>The chemical sector has been featured during successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations. During the<lb/> Dillon Round (1960-61), European countries made their tariff reductions on organic chemicals conditional on the<lb/> abolition of the American Selling Price system of valuation for customs purposes (ASP) by the United States, but no<lb/> agreement was reached. In the Kennedy Round (1964-67), European countries made their offers on the entire<lb/> chemicals sector (Chapters 28 to 39) conditional on the abolition of the ASP. Informal groups were established in five<lb/> sectors, including chemicals, to deal with the sector specific problems (GATT, 1975a). The negotiations resulted in a<lb/> formal plurilateral &quot; agreement &quot; on chemicals<lb/> 15 (WTO (2005b), para. 14). During the Tokyo Round (1973-79), the<lb/> Negotiating Group &quot; Sectoral Approach &quot; was established and worked on various sectors including chemicals,<lb/> 16 but it<lb/> produced no agreement on the sector on a plurilateral basis.<lb/> The Uruguay Round (1986-94) produced several successful plurilateral sectoral negotiations, including the<lb/> chemicals tariff harmonisation agreement (CTHA) and the tariff elimination ( &quot; zero-for-zero &quot; agreement) in<lb/> pharmaceuticals (WTO (2005b), para.27). Initially, contracting parties interested in particular sectors indicated those<lb/> sectors in their tariff reduction proposals in 1990-91, which was followed by negotiations (<ref type="biblio">Stewart et al. (1995)</ref>, pp.414-<lb/>43). In July 1993, the United States, European Communities, Canada and Japan announced an agreement on<lb/> necessary elements for a final agreement, which included a common list of sectors for tariff and non-tariff measure<lb/> elimination (e.g. pharmaceuticals) and tariff harmonisation in chemical products (<ref type="biblio">GATT, 1993</ref>). Under the CTHA it was<lb/> agreed to harmonise and bind the tariff rates at 6.5% (HS Chapters 31-39 and 2916-2942), 5.5% (HS28 and 2903-14)<lb/> and 0% (HS2901-2902 and HS30) with 5, 10 or 15 years of staging depending on the base tariff levels (<ref type="biblio">WTO, 2006;<lb/> WTO, 2005</ref>), except for products covered by the Agreement on Agriculture. This agreement initially had the following<lb/> participants: Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Slovak<lb/> Republic, Switzerland and the United States (Hoda, 2002, p.30). Many more countries have since subscribed to the<lb/> same or similar commitments in particular the recently acceded members to the WTO as a part of their accession<lb/> commitments.<lb/> On pharmaceuticals, it was agreed to eliminate tariffs on items in HS Chapter 30; items in HS headings 2936,<lb/> 2937, 2939, and 2941, with the exception of dihydrostreptomycin and salts, esters, and hydrates thereof; and other<lb/> items including active ingredients which bear an international non-proprietary name (INN) from the World Health<lb/> Organization, and certain additional products used for the production and manufacture of finished pharmaceuticals.<lb/> The participants were Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities (12), Iceland, Japan, New Zealand,<lb/> Norway, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United States (<ref type="biblio">GATT, 1994</ref>). There have been three rounds<lb/> of reviews of the product coverage, which resulted in inclusion of additional products (<ref type="biblio">WTO 1996, 1998, 2007</ref>).<lb/> In the current Doha Development Agenda negotiations (2001-), proposals have been tabled for sectoral tariff<lb/> elimination in the chemicals sector (Chapters 28-39) and for open access to enhanced healthcare (Chapter 30 as well<lb/> as some items from other Chapters including Chapters 28, 29, 87 and 90) (WTO, 2008).<lb/> 17<lb/> 15<lb/> Agreement relating principally to Chemicals, Supplementary to the Geneva (1967) Protocol (GATT,<lb/> L/2819, 17 July 1967).<lb/> 16<lb/></table>

			<head>III.<lb/> Innovation in the chemicals sector and the role of trade<lb/> 1. Innovation activities in the chemicals sector<lb/> i) A short history of innovation in the chemicals sector<lb/></head>

			<p>17.<lb/> The chemical industry 18 has a long history of innovation. It started in the first half of the<lb/> nineteenth century as mostly processing of inorganic chemical compounds taken from the earth into more<lb/> useful products such as lime and soda ashes. The chemical industry was made &quot; the first science-based<lb/> industry &quot; with the launch of organic chemistry in 1856 in Britain, in which inputs such as coal and oil are<lb/> transformed into benzene, ethylene and so on. In particular the production of dyestuffs became the engine<lb/> of growth until WWI, especially in Germany. The advent of polymer chemistry in Germany in the 1920s<lb/> opened the door for the petrochemicals industry, developed initially in the United States, contributing to<lb/> large scale production of a diverse range of polymer products such as synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives<lb/> and paints. A third stage of technological changes is taking place based on the advent of biosciences.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Basic production technologies were diffused geographically over the twentieth century, initially<lb/> among the United States, Europe and Japan and subsequently in Asia and the Middle East. Competitive<lb/> pressure has pushed the industry to restructure, especially in developed countries, moving away from a<lb/> conglomerate structure with physically integrated assets and moving to the areas of core competence and<lb/> product differentiation, often through divestment, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Re-organisations of<lb/> existing companies as well as the emergence of new entrants (SABIC, Sinopec) have made the top 10<lb/> chemical companies list considerably different over the past 10 years (<ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). 19 It is predicted that<lb/> by 2015 there will be only four top-ten producers in developed countries (KPMG International (2010a),<lb/> p.9).<lb/> 19.<lb/> The recent financial crisis has hit the sector in varying degrees depending on the fortunes of the<lb/> downstream users, with the chemicals for automotive and construction industry being hit the hardest, and<lb/> those for pharmaceuticals, food and personal care being hit the least. Nevertheless, the economic downturn<lb/> has generally reinforced the need for further innovation in accordance with the key competitive advantage<lb/> of the business segment. In doing so, wider range of collaboration across the boundary of the firms in<lb/> various activities, including R&amp;D, distribution and marketing, is being called for. In a larger context, the<lb/> financial crisis is considered to accelerate the shift in the centre of gravity of the industry to the emerging<lb/> economies, as companies with cost advantages and better financial positions in the aftermath of the<lb/> financial crisis expand their businesses. 20<lb/> 18<lb/></p>

			<head>ii) Diversity of innovation in the chemicals sector<lb/></head>

			<p>20.<lb/> Various measures of innovation indicate that the chemical industry is among the most innovative<lb/> industries. A study on innovation performance ranking of European industries put &quot; chemicals and chemical<lb/> products &quot; in fourth place, after &quot; electrical and optical equipment &quot; , &quot; ICT &quot; and &quot; Computer services and<lb/> related activities &quot; , and just above &quot; motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers &quot; (Hollanders and Arundel<lb/> (2005), p.14). It is similarly the case in the majority of the 15 European countries surveyed. The proportion<lb/> of innovative firms is higher in chemicals than in manufacturing industry as a whole, both in terms of<lb/> product and process innovation, and of organisational and marketing innovation. And this is consistently<lb/> observed across different countries in this survey. 21<lb/> 21.<lb/> However, aggregated numbers for the &quot; chemicals sector &quot; mask the substantial diversity of its<lb/> sub-sectors. The difference is particularly visible in R&amp;D intensity for pharmaceuticals and the rest of the<lb/> chemicals sector (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>(a)), and as a result pharmaceuticals are often presented separately from the rest<lb/> of the chemicals. 22 This gap has widened in many countries over the past 10 years, as the R&amp;D intensity in<lb/> pharmaceuticals went up while it dipped in the rest of the chemicals (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>(b)).<lb/> 22.<lb/> Neither should the diversity among the rest of the chemicals sector be overlooked. Available data<lb/> up to the 1990s show that R&amp;D intensity tends to be higher in speciality and consumer chemicals than in<lb/> basic industrial chemicals (<ref type="biblio">Fleischer et al. (2000)</ref>, p.85; <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>(a)). Moreover, R&amp;D intensities in<lb/> different sub-sectors have also been diverging over time. Deloitte (2009, p.9) reports that while the R&amp;D<lb/> intensity (R&amp;D/revenues) for speciality chemicals remained in the range of 3.0-3.5% during 1998-2008, it<lb/> has declined from over 2% to 0.5% for commodity chemicals during the same period.<lb/> 23.<lb/> The purpose of R&amp;D spending is also very different in different sub-sectors. A study on<lb/> European chemical firms in 1990s shows that only 30% of basic chemicals firms spend more than 75% on<lb/> product innovation, while more than 60% of agrochemicals, paints and varnishes companies do so<lb/> 21<lb/></p>

Given the different nature of pharmaceuticals, innovation in<lb/> pharmaceuticals is not the primary focus of this study. Hollanders and Arundel (2005) also acknowledges<lb/> that one factor behind the high ranking of &quot; chemicals and chemical products &quot; sector is presence of<lb/> pharmaceuticals (p.30). However, data availability at disaggregate level often limits the possibility of<lb/> separate analysis (see cf. Patel (2008), p.2).<lb/></figure>

			<p>(<ref type="biblio">Albach et al. (1996)</ref>, p.44-47). On the other hand, a larger share of companies in basic chemicals spends<lb/> heavily on process innovation than those in other sub-sectors (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>(b)).<lb/> 24.<lb/> The contribution of new products to sales further illustrates such diversity. A survey of American<lb/> chemical companies shows that, whereas new products contribute to 10% of the sales of basic chemicals,<lb/> they contribute to 23% for speciality and fine chemicals (ACC, 2009).<lb/> 25.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> illustrates such diversity of focus in innovation in different sub-sectors. 23 Among the four<lb/> major types of innovation, the emphasis has generally shifted over time from product innovation to process<lb/> innovation in this industry (<ref type="biblio">Hutcheson et al. (1996)</ref>, p.21), but this shift best applies to basic industrial<lb/> chemicals (<ref type="biblio">Hutcheson et al. 1995</ref>). With limited scope for product innovation, their focus is on process<lb/> innovation and organisational innovation to improve productivity and cost advantage. In contrast, product<lb/> innovation is of primary importance in speciality and fine chemicals, where there is still scope for new<lb/> products and molecules that can be protected by patents and as trade secrets, and as a result price<lb/> competition is less intense compared with that facing trade in basic industrial chemicals. Process<lb/> innovation also plays an important role. In consumer chemicals, renowned for marketing innovation,<lb/> consumers&apos; preference drives product innovation. The remainder of this section will examine the<lb/> underlying industry characteristics of these differences.<lb/></p>

			<head>iii) Underlying Innovation Strategies in Different Segments<lb/></head>

			<p>26.<lb/> To better understand the different foci of innovation, it is useful to refer to the framework for<lb/> structural analysis of industries proposed by <ref type="biblio">Porter (1980, 1985</ref>) before turning to sub-sectors. 24 According<lb/> to the framework, five basic competitive forces – entry, threat of substitution, bargaining power of buyers,<lb/> bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among current competitors – define the state of competition in<lb/> an industry (<ref type="biblio">Porter (1980)</ref>, p.3-4); in coping with these competitive forces, firms have two sources of<lb/> competitive advantage, cost leadership and differentiation (ibid, pp.34-40).<lb/> 27.<lb/> In the case of basic industrial chemicals, major entry barriers are the initial capital requirements<lb/> and the costs associated with technology, supply of raw materials and location. The source of competitive<lb/> advantage is the cost of production because product differentiation is not likely to take place. For speciality<lb/> and fine chemicals, major entry barriers are product differentiation (e.g. product differences and customer<lb/> relations) and differentiation is the major source of competitive advantage. Consumer chemicals are closer<lb/> to speciality and fine chemicals than basic industrial chemicals, but product differentiation (e.g. brand<lb/> loyalty) is a particular entry barrier, and therefore differentiation is typically the key source of competitive<lb/> advantage.<lb/> 23<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Burgess et al. (2002)</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> gives broadly similar illustration. However, this table is only indicative and<lb/> does not suggest that individual firms may not undertake other types of innovation.<lb/></p>

			<head>24<lb/></head>

			<p>The adaptation of Porter framework to the chemicals industry is drawn on <ref type="biblio">Cesaroni et al. (2004)</ref>, p.124;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004)</ref>, pp.26-27. Government can influence many aspects of industry structure<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Porter (1980)</ref>, pp.28-29).<lb/> 28.<lb/> In another related but different framework, Treacy and Wiersema (1993) set out three value<lb/> disciplines, operational excellence, customer intimacy and product leadership, as paths for market<lb/> leadership. Operational excellence means to provide customers with reliable products or services at<lb/> competitive prices and delivered with minimal inconvenience; customer intimacy means segmenting and<lb/> targeting markets and tailoring offerings to match the demands of those niches, thereby establishing<lb/> customer loyalty; and product leadership means offering customers leading-edge products and services that<lb/> enhance the customer&apos;s use of the product, rendering the competitors&apos; product obsolete. Operational<lb/> excellence is closely linked to cost leadership (as in basic industrial chemicals), while customer intimacy<lb/> and product leadership can be seen as two possible means for product differentiation (as in speciality and<lb/> fine chemicals and consumer chemicals), which are also reflected in the different foci of innovation in<lb/> different sub-sectors.<lb/> 29.<lb/> This is inevitably a broad generalisation subject to exceptions and evolution over time. In<lb/> particular, the question of where to find the source of competitive advantage, or the key value disciplines,<lb/> is further accentuated in the economic conditions after the financial crisis (<ref type="biblio">Hodges, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Subsectors<lb/> i) Basic industrial chemicals<lb/></head>

			<p>(a) Industry characteristics<lb/> 30.<lb/> Basic industrial chemicals are essentially commoditised products with established specifications,<lb/> including organic chemicals (mainly derived from petrochemicals) and inorganic chemicals as well as<lb/> polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. They are produced and sold in large volumes and<lb/> occupy a major part of sales value in the chemicals industry. 25 Opportunities to introduce fundamentally<lb/> new products are limited, although variations of existing products can be introduced in response to market<lb/> needs, thus process technology tends to be more important than product innovation. Production plant<lb/> location is mainly driven by production cost and the supply of raw materials and markets.<lb/> 31.<lb/> Manufacturing takes place at large dedicated and capital intensive plants using highly specialised<lb/> processes. Process choices need to be made based on the current and projected costs (e.g. future energy and<lb/> regulatory costs) at the time of plant design, since fundamental process changes ex post are very expensive<lb/> due to their high capital intensity and degree of specialisation, even if incremental investments are often<lb/> made in order to keep up with developments in process technology as well as to ensure compliance with<lb/> new regulatory requirements, to improve health and safety conditions at the plant, to eliminate impurities<lb/> and to re-balance product composition.<lb/> 32.<lb/> High initial capital requirements are a major barrier to entry. On the other hand, the availability<lb/> of key process technologies through licensing has substantially reduced the entry barrier. Available data in<lb/> the 1980s (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(a)) show the prevalence of licensing in sectors with large scale production facilities<lb/> and relatively homogeneous products (e.g. petrochemicals). In particular, licensing from specialised<lb/> engineering firms ( &quot; SEFs &quot; ) has been particularly important for smaller chemical companies or<lb/> &quot; non &quot; -chemical companies, which do not have sufficient in-house technological capabilities (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>(</p>

			<figure>b)).<lb/> SEFs originated in the United States in 1950s and further spread to Germany and other developed<lb/> countries, 26 and they have played an essential role as technology suppliers in processes and plant design to<lb/> 25<lb/> Sales share of European chemical industry (2007) by sub-sectors: &quot; base chemicals &quot; (45%), &quot; specialty<lb/> chemicals &quot; (17%), &quot; consumer chemicals &quot; 11%) and &quot; pharmaceuticals &quot; (27%). (CEFIC (2009))<lb/> 26<lb/> The world market share of SEFs licenses (in total number of plants) in 1980-90 was: US (15.1%), West<lb/> Germany (8.8%), UK (2.4%), Italy (1.6%), France and Japan (0.7% each). (Cesaroni et al. (2004), p.146.)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Europe and Japan through to developing countries. <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>(b) also shows that not only SEFs but also<lb/> chemical companies have been active as technology suppliers. 27 The availability of technology from these<lb/> technology suppliers has been critical to the global emergence of chemical industry we see today.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. The Functions of Chemical Engineering Companies<lb/></head>

			<p>The business of chemical engineering companies usually involve one or some of the following four categories:<lb/></p>

			<p>(i) Licensing of Process Technologies: Process technologies optimised for specific products are developed and<lb/> licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals.<lb/></p>

			<p>(ii) Licensing of equipment designs: Equipment optimised for a particular chemical process are designed and<lb/> licensed to users, especially in basic industrial chemicals. The optimisation involves appropriate control of kinetics,<lb/> thermodynamics and mass transfer processes and designed by using computer modelling.<lb/></p>

			<p>(iii) Supply of manufacturing equipment: This may involve equipment not dedicated to a particular chemical<lb/> process but can be used in different processes (especially in speciality and fine chemicals).<lb/></p>

			<p>(iv) Supply of catalysts: Catalysts designed for a particular process are developed and supplied to users.<lb/> Catalysts are an essential part of many chemical processes and have a finite useful life. Suppliers provide<lb/> replacements and can improve them through R&amp;D.<lb/></p>

			<head>(b) Technology transfer and entry of emerging economies<lb/></head>

			<p>33.<lb/> The trade and innovation linkage in basic industrial chemicals has been making a serious impact<lb/> on the chemicals industry. The large scale transfer of technology from developed countries to emerging<lb/> economies through SEFs and chemical companies as well as through joint ventures and M&amp;As have<lb/> helped emerging country players to innovate and enter into the global market; this has in turn created<lb/> competitive pressure on developed country players to innovate further.<lb/> 34.<lb/> Many emerging economies have been actively promoting the chemical industry to exploit their<lb/> cost advantage and proximity to raw materials (oil and coal) and to growing domestic and neighbouring<lb/> markets. 28 For example, the Indian government has taken steps to improve the competitiveness of the<lb/> chemical industry by abolishing industrial licensing to most of the chemical subsectors, approving FDIs up<lb/> to 100 percent, reducing the list of reserved chemicals for the small-scale sector, and setting up integrated<lb/> Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIR) (<ref type="biblio">Prahalathan (2007)</ref>, p.50; KPMG<lb/> International (2009b), pp.3-4). In China, petrochemicals is one of the industries in Plans for Promoting the<lb/> 10 Leading Industries, announced in January-February 2009, for which large projects are to be supported<lb/> in a prioritised manner, with a target to increase the industry&apos;s value added to 1.75 trillion Yuan by 2011<lb/> (Kwan, 2009). Chemical parks of various scales have been developed, large ones encompassing entire<lb/> 27<lb/></figure>

			<p>At a first glance, active technology licensing by chemical companies looks puzzling, since this appears to<lb/> be a sure way to increase the number of competitors. One explanation is that it was prompted by licensing<lb/> by SEFs, since even if chemical producers do not license their technologies, SEFs will do so anyway (and<lb/> they are under no pressure of potential competition), and it is better for chemical producers to license their<lb/> technology and make some additional profit out of licensing. An alternative explanation is that such<lb/> licensing by chemical companies may also be a part of their strategies, such as to impose a technology<lb/> standard or to provide customers with secondary suppliers using the same technology (<ref type="biblio">Cesaroni et al.<lb/> (2004)</ref>, p.148-49).</p>

			<figure>See also Arora (1997), pp. 397-99; Arora and Fosfuri (1998), pp.10-14.<lb/> 28<lb/> See cf. KPMG International (2010a), pp.8 and 10.<lb/> value chains designed for global players and medium-sized ones developed for domestic investors (KPMG<lb/> International (2009c), p.13; Table 5 below).<lb/> 35.<lb/> Large-scale investment plans in China and the Middle East announced around 2005 are now<lb/> being made operational. It is estimated that new capacity in 2010 in the basic commodities category will<lb/> comprise almost 8% of the existing global capacity, and nearly 80% of the new capacity in 2009-13 will be<lb/> installed in China and Middle East (Deloitte (2009), p.7).<lb/></figure>

			<p>36.<lb/> To enable emerging economy players to develop their production capacities, the availability of<lb/> technologies through licensing from SEFs and chemical companies has played a key role. Chemical plant<lb/> engineering companies offer a package comprising of core technology, engineering design and knowhow,<lb/> and contract construction services (Arora (1997), p.396), and are active in developing large and efficient<lb/> plants being built up in emerging economies (<ref type="biblio">Gottwald, 2007</ref>). A study in India on basic chemical firms<lb/> (inorganic, organic, dyes and pigments, polymers and rubbers) found that acquisition of technological<lb/> capabilities (through investments on imported technology or in-house R&amp;D) is important in determining<lb/> export competitiveness. (<ref type="biblio">Bhat and Narayanan, 2009</ref>)<lb/> 37.<lb/> The entry of emerging market players has exerted strong competitive pressure on chemical<lb/> producers in developed countries (e.g. HLG (2009), p11). The chemicals sector in developed countries,<lb/> especially in basic and intermediate petrochemicals, has already undergone extensive and continuous<lb/> organisational changes and rationalisations during the last three decades as a measure to recover cost<lb/> advantage, driven primarily by competition from new entrants and diminishing economic opportunities<lb/> after the oil shocks in 1970s. Many companies have moved away from being diversified conglomerates to<lb/> focus on their core competencies and have sought to reduce over capacities and to achieve scale economies<lb/> and higher margins (<ref type="biblio">Albach et al. (1996</ref>), pp. 35-47; Landau and Arora (1998), pp. 11-12; Chapman and<lb/> Edmond (2000), pp. 755-760) 29 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>38.<lb/> Alongside cost cutting measures such as implementation of lean manufacturing and extension of<lb/> outsourcing, supply chain management is critical for the industry. Its supply chain extends from raw<lb/> materials to finished products, and the supply chain management costs represent 8-10 percent of the<lb/> turnover of chemical companies (KPMG <ref type="biblio">International, 2009d</ref>). Facing increased complexity of globalised<lb/> supply chains coupled with lower margins, several major chemical companies have launched innovative<lb/> initiatives to optimise their supply chains and cut cost. 30 Information and communication technology is<lb/> widely introduced to implement process innovation in order to better manage supply chains and<lb/> distribution networks, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction (PwC (2010a), pp.2-3, KPMG<lb/> International (2009d), pp. 11-12). Among the US chemical companies, electronic commerce is especially<lb/> prevalent in basic chemicals, where products are more standardised. Electronic commerce makes up for<lb/> 23% of the sales in basic chemicals, whereas it is 10% in speciality chemicals (ACC, 2009).<lb/> 39.<lb/> Sustainability concerns, alongside cost considerations, are other drivers of process innovation.<lb/> For example, the application of biotechnology to chemicals production (industrial biotechnology or &quot; white<lb/> biotechnology &quot; that uses biologically derived catalysts for chemicals production in place of conventional<lb/> ones and may also replace fossil resources with biomass as raw materials, is expected to make production<lb/> processes more environmentally friendly (</p>

			<figure>HLG (2009), p.11; OECD (2001a)). 31 OECD (2010) estimates<lb/> 29<lb/> Deloitte (2009) shows that the commodity chemicals sector experienced sharper decline in gross margin in<lb/> 1998-2008 compared with specialty and integrated chemicals companies. See also Section IV.3, iii) infra.<lb/> 30<lb/> KPMG International (2009d) cites examples of BASF, the Dow Chemical Company, Eastman Chemical<lb/> Company and Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd.<lb/> 31<lb/> See also Section IV.3, iii) infra.<lb/></figure>

			<p>that, although products made by biotechnological processes currently account for only 1.5% in base<lb/> chemicals (2007), much lower than other segments, this ratio will jump to 10% by 2017. Industrial<lb/> biotechnology is at an early stage of its technological lifecycle: close collaboration between industry and<lb/> academia has been playing an important role. 32<lb/></p>

			<head>(c) Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A)<lb/></head>

			<p>40.<lb/> Acquisition and divestiture of businesses are also often a part of large cost cutting and/or<lb/> repositioning strategies for chemical companies. 33 Some large chemical companies, such as ICI, have been<lb/> broken up and/or merged with other companies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>32<lb/> OECD (2001a) pp.72 and 78 provides examples.<lb/> 33<lb/> Largest recent examples include acquisition of ICI by AkzoNobel (Box 3) and Rohm and Haas by Dow<lb/> Chemical in 2008.<lb/> Box 3. Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)<lb/> ICI was founded in 1926 in Britain through a merger of smaller firms to become one of the dominant players in<lb/> the world market in the pre-WWII period, together with IG Farben in Germany (founded in 1925) and DuPont in the<lb/> United States. Operation of ICI for over 50 years focused on three linked large complexes in Teesside at Billingham,<lb/> Wilton and North Tees, with a further large facility at Runcorn and other smaller plants around the world. However, ICI<lb/> progressively withdrew from many of its businesses and employment in chemical industry in Teeside declined from 20<lb/>majority of cross border deals being inbound (i.e. foreign firms acquire Chinese businesses; PwC (2009b),<lb/> p.8). Major Chinese companies have set up joint ventures with global players in China in wide range of<lb/> products (Table 5; Engman et al. 2006, p.125). In one count, a majority of 10 000 chemical units in China<lb/> are joint ventures (Prahalathan, 2007, p.32). However, outbound activities from China are expected to<lb/> expand in near future (PwC (2009b), p.3; Shuqing (2009)).<lb/> 43.<lb/> This broad development is not over today but has been further intensified by the financial crisis.<lb/> KPMG International (2009a) predicts that a massive expansion in bulk chemicals in the Middle East to<lb/> 2015 will make up to 20% of plants of the European petrochemical industry uncompetitive, and that while<lb/> European and US companies concentrate on portfolio rationalisation and divestiture of distressed assets,<lb/> cash rich Middle Eastern and Chinese players will move to acquire these assets to gain access to<lb/> technology and the market over the next one to two years. 38<lb/> Table 5.

Development in chemical distribution industry<lb/></figure>

			<p>Chemical products have typically been distributed directly from the producers to customers, but this is changing.<lb/> A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that this direct supply accounts for 90% of the global<lb/> distribution, but that distribution through third parties has increased by 10% in 2006-08, higher than the growth rate of<lb/> chemicals consumption. Industrial chemicals occupy about 60% of the third-party distribution, whereas specialty<lb/> chemicals make up the remaining 40%.<lb/> If the chemical products are very diverse in nature, so are their customers. 20-40% of chemicals are believed to<lb/> be consumed by customers with annual consumption less than 100 000 euro, depending on the customer industry,<lb/> and this ratio is much higher in China and Brazil (over 75%). Those smaller customers are at the same time<lb/> contributors to profit margin for producers due to strong pressures on prices from larger customers. Handling the<lb/></p>

			<p>distribution for these smaller customers is a particular challenge for the producers, and it has increasingly been<lb/> outsourced to third-party distributors, aiming to improve cost efficiency by rationalising sales efforts or, in case of<lb/> emerging markets, to overcome the insufficient sales volume for direct sales.<lb/></p>

			<p>The business model of chemical distributors is to source from multiple producers to ensure a broad offering; to<lb/> take physical ownership of products, warehouse them and mix, blend and repackage them to meet the needs of<lb/> customers; and to sell and physically transport goods to customers. It is distinguished from the business models of<lb/> logistics-only companies and trading companies, which do not take ownership or offer key value added services such<lb/> as mixing and blending. These services offered by chemical distributors enable customers to benefit from single<lb/> sourcing, speed and flexibility of delivery.<lb/></p>

			<p>The BCG study suggests that there is still room for producers to rationalise their distribution, not only because the<lb/> process of outsourcing is ongoing but also because many of the producers currently have a complex relationship with<lb/> multiple distributors due to lack of coordination across business units and regions. It also notes that more acquisitive<lb/> growth to form a global network will contribute to improve the value and competitiveness of a distribution business, and<lb/> will meet the expectations of producers and customers better.<lb/> During the past several years, M&amp;As in chemical distribution, especially in Europe, has been driven by private<lb/> equity investors, who were attracted by stable cash flows, limited financial risks and profitable exit prospects of this<lb/> business. They are active in acquisition of other chemical distributors to seek synergy and to increase market value.<lb/> The financial crisis also hit the distribution business and M&amp;A activities, but the initial public offering (IPO) of Brenntag<lb/> AG, the leading chemical distributor and owned by BC Partners Ltd, which raised 747.4 million euros in late March<lb/> 2010 is expected to raise the prospect of further flotation and consolidation. As the drive for cost efficiency persists on<lb/> the side of producers, especially in basic industrial chemicals, relations between producers and distributors can<lb/> become more important than ever before.<lb/></p>

			<head>40<lb/> ii) Speciality and fine chemicals<lb/></head>

			<p>(a) Industry characteristics<lb/> 44.<lb/> Speciality and fine chemicals are, compared to basic industrial chemicals, higher value-added<lb/> products produced on a smaller scale in more flexible plants using simpler chemicals as inputs. Examples<lb/> include dyes, paints, sealants and adhesives as well as certain organic chemicals and petrochemicals (e.g.<lb/> engineering plastics). The products are highly specialised and diverse, designed to perform a particular<lb/> function to meet the needs of the market or customers, mainly in other industry segments. An essential<lb/> aspect of the business, therefore, is to sell solutions to customers&apos; problems (<ref type="biblio">Swift (1999)</ref>, p.35). Products<lb/> are also formulated as services (known as chemical management services) instead of goods; e.g. selling<lb/> water treatment services instead of selling chemical products for water treatment. 41<lb/> 45.<lb/> In response to increasing competitive pressure in basic industrial chemicals, many chemical<lb/> companies have been turning to speciality and fine chemicals for their sources of profit where product<lb/> differentiation rather than cost is the key source of competitive advantage (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Burgess et al. (2002</ref>),<lb/> p.200). This is especially the case with developed countries, but companies in China, India and Middle<lb/> East are also seeking to move in this direction (KPMG International (2009b, 2009c), Baker (2009)). The<lb/> relative flexibility of these production plants makes it easier to introduce new process steps or manufacture<lb/> a wide range of products.<lb/> 46.<lb/> The diversity of speciality and fine chemicals is reflected in the impact of the recession since the<lb/> last quarter of 2008. The chemicals used in automotives and construction were hardest hit (coatings,<lb/> 40<lb/> BCG (2010); Fermont (2007); HLG (2009); &quot; The chemistry of private equity &quot; , Chemistry World (February<lb/> 2008); &quot; The time is ripe &quot; ICIS.com (23 November 2009); Martin Arnold &quot; Brenntag listing raises 748m for<lb/> BC Partners &quot; , FT.com (29 March 2010).<lb/> 41<lb/> See CIGT (2002), p.95 and Upstill (2006), p.21 for more illustrations and examples.<lb/></figure>

			<p>adhesives, sealants), in contrast to those used for personal care, food and pharmaceuticals. But such<lb/> conventional product segments still do not complete the picture. For example, a number of companies are<lb/> finding their future in product innovation in environmentally friendly construction chemicals, which are,<lb/> again, coatings, adhesives, sealants, but designed to be energy efficient, durable and less wasteful, and are<lb/> actively investing in the development and commercialisation of those products. 42<lb/></p>

			<head>(b) The role of product innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>47.<lb/> The crucial role of product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can be seen in the higher<lb/> proportion of revenues generated from new products than in industrial chemicals (see supra Section<lb/> III.1.(i)). Product innovation in speciality and fine chemicals can serve various purposes. First, as these<lb/> products are typically designed to achieve certain outcomes (e.g. dyeing fabrics, weeding particular plants),<lb/> new products may be introduced to improve intended performance or to introduce more differentiated<lb/> quality specifications (grades). Second, new chemicals may be introduced to meet new demands created by<lb/> innovation in downstream markets. This is typically the case with new active pharmaceutical ingredients<lb/> supplied to the pharmaceutical industry, but new molecules may be introduced in other sectors to meet new<lb/> economic and social needs, such as the new demand for environmentally friendly products (e.g. fuel cells,<lb/> organic LED). Third, new chemicals may also be introduced due to their improved performance in the<lb/> process of production or use by reducing inputs or eliminating harmful constituents. Finally, new products<lb/> may serve as substitutes for regulated chemicals. This may happen in response to prohibition of some<lb/> chemicals (e.g. CFCs by the Montreal Protocol) or regulation of the way in which products are marketed<lb/> and consumed (e.g. the treatment of effluent or disposal of waste). Trade often serves as a conduit for the<lb/> fruits of innovation in the chemicals sector to improve performance and foster innovation in downstream<lb/> sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 5. Contribution to GHG Emission Savings in Downstream Industries<lb/></head>

			<p>Speciality and fine chemicals can serve as an enabler of innovation for their users, beyond the boundary of the<lb/> chemical industry. Contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is one such example.<lb/> Speciality and fine chemicals are used for various emission saving technologies and products. A report by the<lb/> International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA (2009), p.11) identifies &quot; the biggest levers evaluated for<lb/> emissions savings enabled by the chemical industry &quot; including: insulation materials for the construction industry,<lb/> increased agricultural yields due to crop protection chemicals and fertilisers, new lighting technologies based on<lb/> compact fluorescent lamps, plastic packaging, marine anti-fouling coatings, synthetic textiles, automotive plastics, low<lb/> temperature detergents, increased engine efficiency, plastic piping. In aggregate, this ICCA report estimates that for<lb/> every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by the chemical industry in 2005, it enabled 2.1 to 2.6 tons in savings via the<lb/> products and technologies it provides to other industries or users.<lb/></p>

			<figure>42<lb/> ICIS.com (2009), Deliver the goods (23 November 2009); ICIS.com (2010), Green Build up (15 January<lb/> 2010).<lb/> Box 6. Product Innovation in Response to Regulation and Environmental Concerns<lb/> 43<lb/> AkzoNobel produces a range of chelating agents, which sequester metal ions in aqueous solutions, for<lb/> household and industrial cleaning products such as detergent and soap. One of these products, NTA (nitrilotriacetic<lb/> acid), has been coming under increased regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the United States due to its potential<lb/> carcinogenic impacts. Since global household product manufacturers who use this do not wish to have multiple<lb/> formulations in different markets, the product is likely to be phased out including from markets where it does not face<lb/> regulation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>An alternative product known as Dissolvine GL was developed in 2000. There was initially limited interest from<lb/> customers to test and approve this product because it was more expensive than NTA, but the prospect of regulation<lb/> boosted the interest in this product. There was also a potential environmental benefit that drove interest in it, as it can<lb/> be used as a replacement for some phosphate/phosphonate compounds, which are also under scrutiny in the United<lb/> States, Canada and France. Unlike NTA which is produced from fossil fuels, this alternative product is made using<lb/> natural carbon sources from monosodium glutamate derived from food grade molasses, which means that 60% of the<lb/> carbon atoms in the formulation are derived from sustainable sources and 40% from fossil fuels.<lb/></p>

			<head>48.<lb/></head>

			<p>Trade not only serves as a channel of the fruits of product innovation, but it can also work to<lb/> expand the sources of innovative ideas. A survey shows that customers and suppliers are among the most<lb/> important sources of innovative ideas (after &quot; within the firm &quot; ) (<ref type="biblio">Eurostat, 2007</ref>), but in the chemicals sector<lb/> 38% of firms who introduced a new product answered that their customers were very important as a source<lb/> of information for innovation (26% for overall sample). 44 This is particularly true with speciality and fine<lb/> chemicals, where close customer relationships and servicing are important part of the business (<ref type="biblio">Swift<lb/> (1999)</ref>, p.35).<lb/></p>

			<head>(c) Commoditisation, shift in market gravity and push for further innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>49.<lb/> Even in speciality and fine chemicals, products are often eventually commoditised, and it is<lb/> recognised that this product and technology lifecycle is being shortened thus putting pressure on profits<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Baker (2009)</ref>, p.30; <ref type="biblio">Jerrentrup (2009)</ref>), due in part to globalisation. Chinese companies are active in<lb/> partnership with multinationals to gain access to advanced technologies, alongside in-house R&amp;D (KPMG<lb/> International (2009c), p.8). They are also pursuing outbound M&amp;A in speciality and fine chemicals, the<lb/> main motivation of which is considered to be gaining know-how. 45 Indian firms are also active in overseas<lb/> investment in this segment. 46 A large supply of well qualified chemists and chemical engineers, including<lb/> in emerging economies, together with the increased numbers of flexible chemical manufacturing facilities<lb/> in the world means that there is increasing potential for successful products to be copied by competitors<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Cesaroni et al. (2004)</ref>, p.127).<lb/> 50.<lb/> For example, fine chemical firms who develop and manufacture timber treatment chemicals used<lb/> to anticipate that it would take six years for them to be commoditised following the entry of low cost<lb/> 43<lb/> Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals,<lb/> by Paul Wright, external consultant for this study, and AkzoNobel (2009) &quot; Cleaning up &quot; , AkzoNobel<lb/> Magazine Issue 3 (November 2009).<lb/> 44<lb/> Patel (2008), p.66. This percentage is even higher in biotechnology, machinery, automotives and<lb/> ICT/electronics, which recorded over 40%.<lb/> 45<lb/> China National Bluestar Corporation took over the Silicone Division of Rhodia, a listed France based<lb/> speciality chemical company, in October 2006 at 504 million USD. (Schneider et al. 2009).<lb/> 46<lb/> For example, Kiri Dyes &amp; Chemicals acquired Dy Star (Germany) for 70 million USD in March 2010<lb/> (KPMG International (2010), pp.7 and 11).<lb/></figure>

			<p>producers abroad. This period of time would give the innovator an opportunity to recoup its research and<lb/> development costs. More recently, however, this period has shortened to eighteen months, and the returns<lb/> on product innovation have accordingly fallen for some firms to the point where they can no longer rely on<lb/> it as a source of competitive advantage.<lb/> 51.<lb/> Increased competition makes the case for further innovation even stronger. There has been a wide<lb/> variation in the performance of speciality and fine chemicals companies during the past 10 years, and<lb/> innovation to keep up with the market has been a key feature of the top performers (Deloitte (2009), p.16).<lb/> An econometric analysis at country level (see Appendix 2) also lends some support to the concept that<lb/> innovative capacity (the number of patent applications) is correlated with export and import patterns. 47<lb/> 52.<lb/> However, competition also has an effect of reducing the financial capability to finance R&amp;D<lb/> expenditure, and the time needed for R&amp;D before commercial implementation is critical in the face of<lb/> shortened product lifecycle. This necessity for cost and time savings has driven &quot; open innovation &quot; to gain<lb/> currency (OECD (2008b), p.27): companies increasingly rely on outside innovation for new products and<lb/> processes. De <ref type="biblio">Wit et al. (2007)</ref> found that open innovation is particularly frequently observed in<lb/> development of new technologies in new markets in various sectors albeit to varying degrees. 48 They also<lb/> found that partners for innovation are influenced by the nature of the project: cooperation with universities<lb/> and specialised institutes very often takes place in the development of new technologies, whereas the<lb/> development of new markets with existing technologies takes place in cooperation with other companies.<lb/> 53.<lb/> For example, the development of organic semiconductor materials is being undertaken at an<lb/> international level on various fronts involving large and small companies, often university spin-outs.<lb/> Partners of cooperation can be within the industry or in other industries in order to seek synergy. 49<lb/> Partnership with customers is another possibility, which can foster technological advantages while securing<lb/> business relations. An econometric analysis (see Appendix 2) shows that cross border co-invention 50 has a<lb/> positive impact on the bilateral trade flows. The causation inferred from the timing of patent application<lb/> and trade flows appears to be working differently across sub-sectors, but practically, if collaborative<lb/> activities leading up to patent application is taken into account, such collaborative activities may have<lb/> implications in fostering trade relations.<lb/> 54.<lb/> As the centre of gravity of market shifts to emerging markets, investment in those growing<lb/> markets has become an important part of business strategy, particularly in the speciality and fine chemicals<lb/> segment (<ref type="biblio">Baker, 2009; KPMG International, 2010b</ref>). Because of the specialised nature of this segment,<lb/> proximity to customers is often considered imperative (KPMG (2005), p.31; KMPG International (2009c),<lb/> 47<lb/></p>

			<p>Exporters&apos; patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, and importers&apos; patent<lb/> application is generally negatively correlated with trade flows, although their statistical significance varies<lb/> depending on the sub-sector and the specification.<lb/></p>

			<head>48<lb/></head>

			<p>This study compares between food, polymers and equipment manufacturing sectors in terms of R&amp;D<lb/> collaborations. In all sectors collaboration is the highest for &quot; new market, new technology &quot; , and it is the<lb/> highest in equipment manufacturing and the lowest in polymers.<lb/></p>

			<figure>49<lb/> Süd-Chemie and Linde launched a pilot plant in May 2009 for the production of second generation<lb/> bioethanol from cereal straw. It is expected that Süd-Chemie´s expertise biocatalysis and bioprocess<lb/> engineering and Linde&apos;s experience in implementing chemical and biotechnological processes on a<lb/> commercial scale will generate synergy (Jerrentrup (2009), p.5; Süd-Chemie (2009)).<lb/> 50<lb/> It refers to the number of patents invented by a country with at least one inventor located in a foreign<lb/> country (OECD (2009a), pp.127-28).<lb/> p.12) and this relates not only to production but also extends to R&amp;D functions. 51 This can necessitate<lb/> organisational innovation in making investment decisions and managing extended supply chains.<lb/> 51<lb/> See KPMG International (2010b), Table 2 for recent announcements by chemical companies to expand<lb/> their operations in China.<lb/></figure>

			<head>Box 7. Management of Global R&amp;D Investment Decisions in Emerging Economies<lb/> 52<lb/></head>

			<p>AkzoNobel has multiple applications laboratories located in proximity to the customers, such as Houston (for oil<lb/> field chemicals) and Australia, while retaining the central R&amp;D function in Europe. It is intended to encourage customer<lb/> oriented development of products and formulations and to ensure routes to the market, being assisted by their<lb/> distributor and agent networks that identify end use markets and arrange product trials and approvals. Information on<lb/> the development in those application laboratories are shared across the company through on-line internal forums and<lb/> regular meetings so that interaction of ideas take place and ultimately achieve a higher success rate and wider<lb/> adoption of successful ideas.<lb/> Geographic segmentation changes with developments in economic reality. China and India are now being<lb/> considered as separate regions. In order to make better investment decisions in these regions, the company employs<lb/> a multi-site concept, i.e. locating many products on a single site in a concerted fashion instead of letting individual<lb/> business units decide where to locate new investments.<lb/></p>

			<head>(d) Process innovation as a differentiation strategy<lb/></head>

			<p>55.<lb/> Whilst product innovation is of primary importance, process innovation is another important<lb/> aspect of innovation in speciality and fine chemicals. It is typically a part of the differentiation strategy<lb/> rather than for cost reduction purposes, for example by reducing lead-time, or enhancing agility, to better<lb/> serve customers (<ref type="biblio">Burgess (2002)</ref>; <ref type="biblio">Guisinger and Ghorashi (2004)</ref>; Jerrentrup (2009), p.5). Introduction of<lb/> new products is also often accompanied by the introduction of new processes.<lb/> 56.<lb/> Process itself can be a core competence of a chemical company. For example, pharmaceutical<lb/> companies often invite competent chemical producers to supply samples of specific candidate<lb/> pharmaceutical chemicals. Suppliers need to undertake high quality synthesis according to the process<lb/> specified by the pharmaceutical company or by developing their own process, initially at a small scale but<lb/> eventually it may turn into a larger scale production. Some companies have developed core competence in<lb/> process technologies to meet such requirements.<lb/></p>

			<head>iii) Consumer chemicals<lb/></head>

			<p>(a) Industry characteristics<lb/> 57.<lb/> Consumer chemicals are usually formulated products such as personal care products or household<lb/> products. These are differentiated from other segments in that they are marketed to consumers and<lb/> customer influence is much greater. Consumer chemicals are often grouped together with food, drinks and<lb/> tobacco as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) or consumer packaged products, which is known as the<lb/> birth place of brand management and renowned for marketing innovation (<ref type="biblio">Crawford et al. 2007</ref>). Product<lb/> innovation and underlying R&amp;D capability is also indispensable to respond to diverse and often fluid<lb/> consumer preference, and to maintain the power of the brand (<ref type="biblio">Jones, 2005</ref>). Although consumer chemicals<lb/> have generally weathered the recession better than others, product innovation that reinforces brand loyalty,<lb/> such as in the field of natural personal care, will stimulate recovery, as the patterns of recovery from<lb/> previous recessions attests.</p>

			<figure>53<lb/> 52<lb/> Information taken from an interview with Alan Alex, Chelates EMEA, AkzoNobel Functional Chemicals,<lb/> by Paul Wright, an external consultant for this study, and Baker (2009), p.31.<lb/> 53<lb/> Gillian Morris (2010), &quot; Recession respite &quot; , ICIC.com (14 April 2010).<lb/></figure>

			<p>58.<lb/> In addition to consumer chemicals marketed directly to consumers, many chemical companies<lb/> produce chemical materials for a range of goods marketed to consumers, such as textiles and clothing<lb/> (chemical fibres and dyes), footwear and car seats (polyurethane). They are typically not visible to<lb/> consumers, but the materials are sometimes highlighted when the final goods are marketed.<lb/></p>

			<head>(b) Diversity of consumer preference and emerging markets<lb/></head>

			<p>59.<lb/> Although multinationals with well-known brands are active in this area, key success factors are<lb/> in-depth knowledge of local market and the ability to adjust the products and marketing methods to local<lb/> consumer preference and other market characteristics. They can be vastly different and at the same time<lb/> changeable. One example is the sense of hygiene: when the practice of washing bodies with water was out<lb/> of fashion in Europe, despite the wide-spread practice of bathing in ancient Roman times, perfumes came<lb/> to the fore among aristocracy, until the practice revived thanks to development of modern germ theory and<lb/> spread of new ideas brought by foreign trade (e.g. &quot; champu &quot; (shampoo) from India); the white soap bar<lb/> was launched by an American entrepreneur in 1879, which later benefited from new marketing channels of<lb/> radio and television ( &quot; soap opera &quot; ) starting in the 1930s. 54<lb/> 60.<lb/> More recently, social and environmental issues have become an important factor behind<lb/> consumer preferences, and consumer chemical companies are finding market opportunities here. For<lb/> example, life-cycle assessments of the energy consumption by Proctor &amp; Gamble for its products found<lb/> that 3% of electricity budgets in US households were on heating water for laundry (<ref type="biblio">Nidumolu et al. (2009)</ref>,<lb/> p.8), which led to the launch of cold water detergents in 2005. Unilever considers it important to establish<lb/> &quot; social missions &quot; for brands to grow (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey &amp; Co., 2009a</ref>). In the cosmetics industry, to stimulate<lb/> sustainable production and consumption, the COSMOS-standard has been developed in Europe that<lb/> defines minimum requirements and common definitions for organic and/or natural cosmetics. Consumers&apos;<lb/> attention can go beyond the narrow definition of consumer chemicals, due to the ubiquitous nature of<lb/> chemical products, and extend to the chemical inputs used in ranges of products, such as polyurethane<lb/> derived from vegetable used in car seats, biodegradable cosmetic packages, or soy inks. Well-informed,<lb/> empowered consumers are a powerful ally in supporting and driving green growth (OECD (2010b), p.80).<lb/> 61.<lb/> Adding to these, breaking into consumer markets in emerging economies is increasingly an<lb/> important challenge. 55 They are keener and leaner on prices, and their distribution and marketing channels<lb/> tend to be very different from those of developed country markets, yet the consumers in emerging markets<lb/> are increasingly vital sources of further growth, especially amid slower growth in developed countries. 56<lb/> 62.<lb/> For example, expanding the market into more remote areas in India was a challenge due to the<lb/> lack of a retail network, advertising coverage and adequate roads and transport for Unilever despite its 75<lb/> year history in India supplying food, personal care and home care products through a portfolio of<lb/> international and local brands targeting consumers of different income levels. Hindustan Lever, Unilever&apos;s<lb/> business in India, started &quot; Project Shakti &quot; ( &quot; strength &quot; in Sanskrit) in 2000 by partnering with local<lb/> women&apos;s self-help groups. Members of the groups are given training by the company to be entrepreneurs,<lb/> and they borrow money from the groups to start businesses as distributors of Hindustan Lever products. By<lb/> the end of 2004, there were over 13 000 Shakti women entrepreneurs covering 50 000 villages, selling to<lb/> 70 million consumers. (Unilever (a); <ref type="biblio">Keys et al. 2009</ref>) Hindustan Lever is also developing a separate<lb/> 54<lb/></p>

			<p>campaign to educate people to wash their hands with soap, called &quot; &apos;Swasthya Chetna &quot; (health awakening),<lb/> as a marketing programme for its soap brand. By the end of 2007, the campaign had reached nearly 44 000<lb/> villages and around 100 million people. (<ref type="biblio">Unilever (b)</ref>)<lb/> 63.<lb/> Not only marketing innovation, but also product innovation is taking place to develop products<lb/> that meets the specific needs of emerging markets. Proctor &amp; Gamble started its business in China in 1988<lb/> through a joint venture targeting consumers in wealthy coastal cities with its premium products. By 2001,<lb/> this strategy reached its limits and it needed to expand to the &quot; mid-tier consumers &quot; to sustain growth and<lb/> profitability, in direct competition with local companies with lower costs and better knowledge about the<lb/> local consumers. In order to achieve the price levels affordable for these new consumers, which is vastly<lb/> different from those of globally marketed products, P&amp;G now designs products in China, controlling the<lb/> costs to meet the required price levels. (<ref type="biblio">Hexter and Woetzel, 2007</ref>, pp.6-7)<lb/> 64.<lb/> There is an early sign that product innovation and marketing efforts are contributing to the<lb/> recovery of consumer products companies. Proctor &amp; Gamble and Unilever both announced 7% increases<lb/> in sales, and the introduction of new products and additional spending on marketing are considered to have<lb/> boosted the sales, and strong sales growth in emerging markets has contributed to this overall<lb/> performance. 57<lb/> 65.<lb/> In some cases, products developed for emerging markets are being re-introduced to developed<lb/> country markets – labelled &quot; trickle-up &quot; innovation or &quot; reverse innovation &quot; to highlight the contrast to a<lb/> traditional model where a product is developed in developed countries and eventually marketed in<lb/> developing countries. The reported case that comes close to consumer chemicals is an over-the-counter<lb/> medicine by Proctor &amp; Gamble, initially developed for the Latin American market and eventually<lb/> rebranded and marketed in the United States and European markets 58 , but otherwise reported cases are still<lb/> limited. 59 Yet it has been argued that it is more a necessity than an option to compete effectively with<lb/> emerging market competitors. Given the increasing economic weight of emerging economies and the<lb/> increasing price-consciousness of consumers in developed countries, as well as tighter R&amp;D budgets of<lb/> MNEs, this can become one of the models of product innovation in consumer chemicals.<lb/></p>

			<head>IV.<lb/> Trade-related measures<lb/> 1. Tariffs<lb/></head>

			<p>66.<lb/> Even though the levels of tariffs have declined over the past ten years, there still remain non-<lb/>negligible levels of tariffs, especially in non-CTHA participants, that incur direct costs to traders and<lb/> consequently consumers. Econometric analysis based on the gravity model (Appendix 2) shows that tariffs<lb/> still have a negative impact on trade in chemicals.<lb/> 67.<lb/> In order to see how actual tariff levels are related to innovation considerations, we could test the<lb/> following two possibilities. First, if countries value technology diffusion through imports (cf. <ref type="biblio">Coe et al.<lb/> 2008</ref>), they may tend to set up relatively lower trade barriers for sectors with relatively less technological<lb/> 57<lb/></p>

On the other hand, if countries emphasise infant industry protection,<lb/> they may tend to set up relatively higher trade barriers for less competitive industries (cf. Krugman, 1987).<lb/> 68.<lb/> A simple investigation of correlation between relative tariff levels, relative export value (i.e.<lb/> revealed comparative advantage) and relative R&amp;D spending</table>

			<p>shows that there is no statistical evidence to<lb/> support either of those hypotheses (see Appendix 3 for details). This may imply, as far as the chemical<lb/> industry is concerned, that innovation considerations are not systematic determinants for tariff policy in<lb/> most of the countries. Another possibility is that innovation considerations are actually systematic<lb/> determinants for tariff policy but are working in different directions (either technology diffusion enhancing<lb/> or infant industry protecting) across countries, which also prevent a systematic statistical relationship from<lb/> emerging as a whole. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from the exercise here.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Export Restrictive Measures<lb/></head>

			<p>69.<lb/> While access to raw materials under fair and undistorted conditions is essential for a range of<lb/> industries including chemicals, tight supply and demand conditions as well as various forms of government<lb/> intervention aiming at restricting exports have been making it more challenging than before (European<lb/> Commission (2008c), pp.4-5).<lb/> 70.<lb/> Disciplines on export restrictions are provided generally in GATT Article XI paragraph 1; &quot; No<lb/> prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas,<lb/> import or export licences or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on<lb/> the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale<lb/> for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party. &quot; 60 This is, however,<lb/> subject to an exception in the GATT Artile XI paragraph 2 and general exceptions under GATT Article<lb/> XX, notably its chapeau and (g) ( &quot; relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such<lb/> measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption &quot; ).<lb/></p>

			<figure>71.<lb/> Whereas import duties are placed under the disciplines contained in the Schedules of Concession<lb/> (GATT Article II), there is nothing that generally restricts export duties 61 in the current GATT provisions. 62<lb/> It is worth noting, however, commitment by individual Members to limit export duties on specific tariff<lb/> lines can be found either as a part of accession commitment, 63 or as a part of the Schedules of Concession,<lb/> with respect to specific tariff lines, although the actual cases are very limited. MFN principle applies also<lb/> to export duties (GATT Article I.1).<lb/> 60<lb/> GATT Article VIII.3(a), 5 (Fees and Formalities connected with Importation and Exportation) and X.1<lb/> (Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations) lay out procedural principles that apply to exports<lb/> as well as imports. In addition, export taxes and export restrictions are listed as one of the &quot; Indicative List<lb/> of Notifiable Measures &quot; in the &quot; Decision on Notification Procedures &quot; adopted at the end of the Uruguay<lb/> Round negotiations, although it is accompanied by a note that states &quot; [t]his list does not alter existing<lb/> notification requirements &quot; in the agreement. &quot; Decision on Notification Procedure on Quantitative<lb/> Restrictions &quot; was adopted in 1996 (but not on export duties), and the notifications are regularly monitored,<lb/> although the actual notifications made have been less than complete. See G/L/223/Rev.17 (15 March 2010)<lb/> for the latest update.<lb/> 61<lb/> Export duties and export taxes have been used interchangeably. See Kazeki (2005), pp. 178-79.<lb/> 62<lb/> In some instances, export restrictions and prohibitions were replaced by export duties following the legal<lb/> disputes at the WTO. See Kazeki (2005), p.212.<lb/> 63<lb/> Examples are listed in Kazeki (2005), Table 5.4.<lb/></figure>

			<p>72.<lb/> While the export restrictive measures have thus been subject to a lesser extent of discipline<lb/> compared with import measures under the GATT/WTO system, 64 it has in the past addressed this issue in<lb/> the context of supply of raw materials, in particular oil, in the 1970s 65 and of voluntary export restraints in<lb/> the 1980s 66 , and now it is drawing renewed attention in the context of supply of raw materials. The<lb/> chemical industry has also voiced their concerns over recent moves by some governments to take export<lb/> restrictive measures, such as export taxes on yellow phosphorus and export licenses or quotas on fluorspar<lb/> and coke by China, thereby restricting supplies to other countries to, various raw materials (HLG (2009),<lb/> p.33). When the raw material production is concentrated in a few countries (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>), export restrictive<lb/> measures taken by a producing country can have a large impact on the global supply, and hence on the<lb/> industries using the raw materials in question.<lb/> 73.<lb/> In the WTO, proposals to enhance transparency in export licensing and to establish of rules on<lb/> transparency and predictability on export duties are pending in the Doha negotiations. 67 Export related<lb/> measures on raw materials are also pending before the dispute settlement panel, which covers, in part,<lb/> essential inputs to some segments of the chemicals industry and inorganic chemicals used in other<lb/> industries. 68<lb/> 74.<lb/> While the stated policy objectives of export restrictive measures include environmental<lb/> protection, promotion of domestic downstream industries, fiscal revenues and preservation of reserves, the<lb/> actual economic impact of export restrictive measures and their effectiveness in achieving these objectives<lb/> depends on various factors, such as supply and demand conditions, availability of alternative sources as<lb/> well as the nature of the raw material in question and of the measure itself (<ref type="biblio">Korinek and Kim (2009)</ref>,<lb/> pp.12-22). The trade policy review report on China prepared by the WTO Secretariat observed &quot; <ref type="biblio">[a]</ref>lthough<lb/> the authorities believe that export taxes could help conserve natural resources or protect the environment,<lb/> their economic effectiveness in achieving those objectives is questionable. &quot; (WTO (2010a), para. 78) At<lb/> the OECD workshop on raw materials held in October 2009, it was found that &quot; export restrictions create<lb/> economic inefficiency by distorting resource allocation and can negatively affect the welfare of trade<lb/> partners &quot; and &quot; <ref type="biblio">[w]</ref>hile export restrictions are applied to achieve several policy objectives, there exist<lb/> alternative policy options with different trade impacts &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Kim, 2009</ref>). 69 Further studies are envisaged on this<lb/> topic.<lb/></p>

			<head>64<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite this asymmetry between exports and imports, economic theory postulates that export tax in one<lb/> sector amounts to import tax on the other (Lerner&apos;s symmetry theorem), which further implies that import<lb/> tax in one sector amounts to export tax on the other. See Vousden (1990), pp.46-47.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Health, safety and environmental regulation<lb/> i) Regulation and multilateral trade rules<lb/></head>

			<p>75.<lb/> The chemical sector is highly regulated for safety, health and environmental reasons and there<lb/> has been significant evolution in the regulatory regime during the past few decades. When governments<lb/> started to take regulatory actions on chemicals, they focused on specific industrial chemicals or pesticides<lb/> which were known to pose important health or environmental problems, but by mid-1970s, comprehensive,<lb/> forward-looking strategies were called for to identify and manage the potential risks of the hundreds of<lb/> new chemicals and chemical products entering the global market every year. Somewhat later, the much<lb/> greater number of chemicals and pesticides that were already on the market and whose potential risks had<lb/> not been identified arose as a policy issue (OECD (2001b), p.76). The OECD has been active since 1971 in<lb/> developing and co-ordinating chemical and pesticide related activities under its Chemicals Programme<lb/> (OECD (2008c), p.383). There are a number of other international arrangements to control chemicals for<lb/> various purposes. 70<lb/> 76.<lb/> The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 called for chemicals to be<lb/> produced and used in ways that minimise significant adverse impacts on human health and the<lb/> environment ( &quot; 2020 goal &quot; ). Since then, many countries have taken steps to improve their chemicals<lb/> regulation. Also, the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) was adopted as<lb/> a policy framework to foster the sound management of chemicals in 2006.<lb/> 77.<lb/> Under the rules of the WTO, Members are generally able to take measures necessary to protect<lb/> human, animal or plant life or health, &quot; <ref type="biblio">[s]</ref>ubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a<lb/> manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries<lb/> where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade &quot; (GATT Article XX,<lb/> chapeau and (b)).</p>

			<figure>More specifically, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade ( &quot; TBT Agreement &quot; )<lb/> 70<lb/> E.g. the Basel Convention (hazardous waste), the Montreal Protocol (CFCs) and the Rotterdam Convention<lb/> (hazardous chemicals), Stockholm Convention (persistent organic pollutants), United Nations Convention<lb/> Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (drug control) and the Chemical<lb/> Weapons Convention (arms control).<lb/></figure>

			<p>stipulates a set of rules to ensure that technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary<lb/> obstacles to international trade, while recognising the policy objectives of the protection of human, animal<lb/> or plant life or health, of the environment (TBT Agreement, preamble). It lays out, among others, a<lb/> notification procedure for technical regulations when a relevant international standard does not exist and if<lb/> the technical regulation may have a significant effect on the trade (TBT Agreement, Article 2.9; Article 5.6<lb/> for conformity assessment procedures).<lb/> 78.<lb/> According to the TBT Information Management System, database maintained by the WTO<lb/> Secretariat, there have been over 1600 notifications under Article 2.9 and 140 notifications under Article<lb/> 5.6 for chemicals (HS Chapters 28-39) since the WTO came into being in 1995. 71 Almost half of them<lb/> refer to human health, followed by environmental protection and labelling. The pattern is substantially<lb/> different across different product groups; &quot; human health &quot; predominant in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics<lb/> (Chapters 30 and 33), while both &quot; human health &quot; and &quot; environmental protection &quot; often appear<lb/> miscellaneous chemicals (Chapter 38; often pesticides) as well as for organic and inorganic, fertilisers and<lb/> paints (Chapters 28, 29, 31, 32). In contrast, &quot; labelling &quot; , &quot; safety &quot; , &quot; packaging &quot; and &quot; consumer protection &quot;<lb/> are more frequent for consumer chemicals.<lb/></p>

			<head>ii) Chemicals regulation and impact on innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>80.<lb/> The rules of the WTO are an instrument to balance the objectives of protecting health, safety and<lb/> environment and trade liberalisation. 76 On the other hand, whether and to what extent environmental<lb/> regulations and innovation interact with each other has been extensively debated and analysed. While<lb/> empirical analysis on the chemical regulation has not been abundant (<ref type="biblio">Mahdi (2002)</ref>, p.9-16), the recent<lb/> regulatory developments in the chemicals sector have drawn much attention.<lb/> 75<lb/> Excerpt from WTO (2010b), pp.25-35.<lb/> 76<lb/> Another instrument are the OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance (OECD<lb/> 2005b), as concerns to market openness. The impact of standards on trade flows depends on their specific<lb/> types. WTO (2005b), pp.57-74 provides an overview.<lb/></figure>

			<p>81.<lb/> The chemicals regulations in OECD countries have typically been designed as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>Governments collected data from chemical manufacturers to establish inventories of chemicals currently<lb/> being produced, thereby establishing the distinction between &quot; existing &quot; (on the inventory) and &quot; new &quot; (not<lb/> on the inventory) chemicals. Pre-market notification and registration/approval systems for industrial<lb/> chemicals and pesticides are in place in most OECD countries, and submission of information is required<lb/> for the authorities to assess the risks posed by the substance. This data requirement varies across countries.<lb/> On the other hand, prior to the introduction of pre-market regulation, chemicals were allowed to be put on<lb/> the market with very little or no information concerning their potential risks to human health and the<lb/> environment (OECD (2001b), pp.76-78).</p>

			<figure>Major policy questions have been raised regarding this regulatory<lb/> scheme, such as the adequacy of risk assessment of new chemicals (data requirement from the businesses<lb/> and allocation of responsibilities between the authorities and businesses) and how to ensure the safety of<lb/> the existing chemicals (see e.g. European Commission (2001), p.6; USGAO (2007); USGAO (2009),<lb/> pp.22-24).<lb/></figure>

			<p>82.<lb/> In recent years, various initiatives have been introduced in many jurisdictions regarding<lb/> chemicals regulations. Among them, the EU&apos;s REACH regulation, entered into force on 1 June 2007, has<lb/> been widely expected to bring about a sea change in chemicals regulation in Europe and will also have<lb/> global impact. It covers all substances, new and old, unless explicitly exempted, and introduces a<lb/> registration scheme that requires manufacturers and importers to obtain relevant information (technical<lb/> dossier or chemical safety report, depending on the quantity) on their substance as well as an authorisation<lb/> system for substances of very high concern. Downstream users are also brought into the system and share<lb/> certain responsibilities (European Commission (2007), pp.5-7). REACH has been a major issue of<lb/> discussion at the WTO&apos;s TBT Committee. 77 Many non-EU WTO Members raised questions around,<lb/> among others, the data generation requirements under REACH in relation to the obligations of non-<lb/>discrimination and of not creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade according to terms of the<lb/> TBT Agreement.<lb/> 83.<lb/> Aside from the debate at the WTO, the REACH legislation has proven an important development<lb/> for regulators in exploring the possible regulatory initiatives on the chemical substances. 78 <ref type="biblio">There</ref> have been<lb/> a number of regulatory initiatives in recent years, and following is some of such examples.<lb/> 84.<lb/> China has been preparing the amendment to its chemical control scheme under Measures on<lb/> Environmental Management of New Chemical Substances, introduced in 2003. 79 The first draft released in<lb/> May 2009 was updated in January 2010, and it is scheduled to be implemented starting October 2010. The<lb/> amendment maintains the basic structure</figure>

			<p>of the current law, which applies to &quot; new &quot; substances, and<lb/> &quot; registration certificate &quot; of the new substance is required before manufacture or import of the substance.<lb/> The revision, on the other hand, is to increase the data requirement and risk management obligations by the<lb/> industry (<ref type="biblio">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, 2009</ref>). Certain ecotoxicological testing needs to be completed at<lb/> an accredited Chinese testing laboratory by using species within domestic China, and unlike the current<lb/> law, only a Chinese-registered entity can perform a submission and will be considered the registrant of the<lb/> substance (<ref type="biblio">Bergeson &amp; Campbell,</ref> P.C. 2010).<lb/> 77<lb/> Motaal (2009), pp.649-657.

See Park<lb/> (2009), Table 1 and Figure 2 for an overview of the structure of Chinese chemical control system.<lb/> 85.<lb/> Japan enacted an amendment to the Chemical Substances Control Law (Kashinho) in 2009 and<lb/> the first phase of implementation started in April 2010 (its full implementation is scheduled in April 2011).<lb/> It introduced an annual notification of production and import quantity of all chemical substances above<lb/> threshold, and hazard information may be requested for substances of higher priority of risk assessment. 80<lb/> In parallel, collection of safety information on the prioritised existing chemicals is ongoing under the<lb/> &quot; Japan Challenge &quot; programme since 2005.<lb/> 86.<lb/> Canada launched the Chemicals Management Plan in December 2006, under which harmful<lb/> chemicals were regulated immediately, and collection of information ( &quot; challenge &quot; ) on the properties and<lb/> uses is ongoing for the approximately 200 substances of highest priority. The information will be used to<lb/> decide the best approach to protect health and the environment (Government of Canada, 2009).<lb/> 87.<lb/> The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Essential Principles for Reform of<lb/> Chemicals Management Legislation in September 2009, setting out Administration goals to strengthen</figure>

			<p>the<lb/> chemicals regulation, which includes a requirement for manufacturers to provide sufficient hazard,<lb/> exposure and use data on new and existing chemicals to determine their safety, and authority of EPA to set<lb/> priorities for conducting safety reviews on existing chemicals. In parallel, it announced the Chemical<lb/> Management Program which includes risk management on specific chemicals, collection of information to<lb/> prioritise chemicals for review and give public access to information.<lb/> 88.<lb/> The consequence of the regulation was extensively discussed in the preparatory process of<lb/> REACH since the concept was unveiled in 2001 (<ref type="biblio">European Commission (2001)</ref>). KPMG (2005),<lb/> commissioned by the European Commission and European industry groups, found that (a) critical<lb/> substances are not likely to disappear because of REACH testing and registration costs, because suppliers<lb/> are well aware of the impact of withdrawal of substances to the downstream users; (b) as product cost will<lb/> increase because of registration requirement, especially for substances manufactured or imported in lower<lb/> volumes, rationalisation of product portfolios may take place primarily on substances of less critical<lb/> importance to customers and of less strategic importance within the portfolios; even a small percentage of<lb/> withdrawal can give rise to much larger need for reformulation downstream; (c) companies studied do not<lb/> plan to increase their R&amp;D budget, and they will give priority to keeping existing substances and<lb/> formulations on the market to avoid problems down the supply chain, so the scale of divergence of R&amp;D<lb/> budgets depends on the scope of rationalisation; there can also be some delay in the time-to-market as the<lb/> R&amp;D department will get involved in registration activities; and (d) the stress factors accumulate at SMEs.<lb/> 89.<lb/> The recent regulatory initiatives reviewed above generally point to (a) enhancement of data<lb/> collection of chemical substances, although with considerable differences in scope and data requirements,<lb/> and (b) extension of regulatory coverage to the existing chemicals. Their impact can be thought of in terms<lb/> of both the &quot; rate &quot; of innovation and the &quot; direction &quot; of innovation (cf. Mahdi (2002), p.9). First, if new<lb/> regulations involve additional cost and time burdens, they may have a negative effect on innovative<lb/> activities (rate of innovation). Second, new regulations may give incentives toward safer and more<lb/> environmentally friendly chemicals (direction of innovation).<lb/> 90.<lb/> First, the impact of additional cost and time on innovation is likely to be different for different<lb/> sub-sectors. For industrial chemicals, as most of their products are in the &quot; existing &quot; category, if new<lb/> chemical regulation is to require submission of data on all chemicals, this will mean additional cost which<lb/> was not foreseen before, and because of the standardised nature of the products competing on prices,<lb/> transferring additional cost onto prices could be difficult. On the other hand, because of their large scale<lb/> 80<lb/> <ref type="biblio">METI et al, (2009)</ref>;</p>

			<figure>See Naiki (2010) for a comparative analysis of Japanese chemicals regulation and<lb/> REACH.<lb/></figure>

			<p>production, the additional cost can be mitigated by the economies of scale (<ref type="biblio">Frohwein and Hansjürgens<lb/> (2004)</ref>, pp.30-31).<lb/> 91.<lb/> In contrast, for speciality and fine chemicals, characterised by continuous product innovation,<lb/> product differentiation and small scale production, if a new regulation incurs additional time and greater<lb/> cost to registration and authorisation of new chemicals than before, this may delay or discourage the<lb/> introduction of new chemicals. If the new regulation extends to existing chemicals, additional regulatory<lb/> burden may result in rationalisation of portfolio of chemicals in the market, especially for low-volume or<lb/> low-margin products. As a quick and flexible response to specific and low-volume customer needs is based<lb/> on the availability of a large pool of differentiated chemical substances, if new regulation diminishes the<lb/> existing and future chemical portfolio, it can adversely affect the competitiveness in this segment and can<lb/> impair the prospect of further innovation. And this, unlike the one-off cost of registration, can leave a<lb/> lasting effect. (</p>

			<figure>Frohwein and Hansjürgens (2004), pp.31-32; Feldmeier and Kienert (2008)) The practical<lb/> effect on innovation depends on the actual time and cost burden and to what extent such rationalisation<lb/> takes place. 81<lb/> 92.<lb/> Second, regulatory tightening can encourage the innovative efforts toward safer products. 82 Such<lb/> regulatory measures are not limited to outright restrictions of hazardous chemicals but can include various<lb/> other types of measures. Koch and Ashford (2005, pp.43-44) reports the effects of the Massachusetts<lb/> Toxics Use Reduction Act (TURA) passed in 1989, which introduced a requirement for firms to prepare a<lb/> Toxics Use Reduction Plan to show how toxic chemicals are used and how they could be reduced. Out of 1<lb/>registration of 30 000 substances is scheduled to take place in three stages over the first 11 years after entry<lb/> into force (European Commission, 2007). It is therefore necessary to keep track of those developments in<lb/> order to properly assess their full impact. 86<lb/> Box 8. A short review of the literature on the impact of environmental regulation on innovation<lb/></figure>

			<p>Regulation has typically been seen as a source of concern in terms of competitiveness of industries, since it<lb/> imposes extra cost and time burden and diverts resources away from innovation. However, Porter and van der Linde<lb/> (1995, p.98) presented an entirely opposite view, arguing that &quot; properly designed environmental standards can trigger<lb/> innovation that may partially or more than fully offset the costs of complying with them &quot; because &quot; reducing pollution is<lb/> often coincident with improving the productivity with which resources are used &quot; drawing on examples to support this<lb/> &quot; Porter hypothesis &quot; .<lb/> 87<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of environmental regulation on innovation has also been a subject of economic analyses<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Jaffe et al. 2000, pp. 31, 65</ref>). There have been a substantial number of studies that suggests that more stringent<lb/> environmental regulation or higher electricity prices induce innovative activities and enhance energy efficiency<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Popp et al. 2009</ref>, pp.7-23); if not completely &quot; offset &quot; the compliance cost that Porter hypothesis alluded to. The impact<lb/> of regulation can even go beyond the national border. One such example is car emissions regulations in the United<lb/> States in 1970s, which prompted innovation by Japanese and German automotive industries (ibid. p.36). It is important<lb/> to note that an empirical study on this question should be read in its specific context; all environmental regulations are<lb/> not created equal, and their impact on industries<lb/> 88 and their responses are not the same.<lb/> Academic debates aside, businesses have already been embracing environmental and social issues even<lb/> without regulations and many of them recognise the business benefits<lb/> 89 (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey &amp; Co., 2009b, 2010; KPMG<lb/> International, 2009b, pp.12-14)</ref>, and better ways to integrate them as a driver of innovation and to link to corporate<lb/> strategy are being explored (<ref type="biblio">Porter and Kramer, 2006; Nidumolu et al. 2009</ref>).<lb/> As business takes initiatives to improve its performance and governments act to address market failures, which<lb/> includes both environmental (negative) externalities and of knowledge diffusion leading to innovation (positive<lb/> externalities)<lb/> 90 by introducing regulation, the impact of regulation on innovation remains a valid area of research. From<lb/> a policy standpoint, integrating both economic and environmental considerations in regulatory decision-making is a<lb/> challenge, and it is a key feature of the green growth strategy that the OECD is developing (OECD (2010b), p.77).<lb/></p>

			<head>iii) Climate change<lb/></head>

			<figure>94.<lb/> The climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 produced the Copenhagen<lb/> Accord, which includes the recognition that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees<lb/> Celsius, a collective commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional resources<lb/> approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010–12, and implementation and reporting of reduction and<lb/> mitigation of emissions. As this is not considered a full agreement, the negotiation process is expected to<lb/> continue toward the next conference in Mexico in 2010. On the other hand, the EU Emissions Trading<lb/> 86<lb/> Pre-registration was due on 1 December 2008, and registration for the first batch of chemicals will be due<lb/> on 30 November 2010. The final due date will be 31 May 2018.<lb/> 87<lb/> See cf. Paul Krugman, &quot; An Affordable Truth &quot; , the New York Times, 7 December 2009 (referring to an<lb/> impact of cap-and-trade system for sulphur dioxide in the United States in 1990).<lb/> 88<lb/> Jaffe et al. (1995), p.141, reports sectoral disaggregation of pollution abatement expenditures in the United<lb/> States in 1992.<lb/> 89<lb/> KPMG International (2009b) for chemical industry; McKinsey &amp; Co. (2009b) for survey results, and The<lb/> Economist, &quot; Size Matters &quot; (4 December 2009) for consumer electronics.<lb/> 90<lb/> See Popp et al. (2009), pp.3-6 for fundamentals of economics of environment and technological change.<lb/> Scheme (ETS) has been in effect since 2005 and is scheduled to be expanded in 2013. A trial<lb/> implementation of an integrated domestic market for emissions trading started in Japan in October 2008.<lb/> Introduction of cap-and-trade system is also a priority of the current US administration. 91<lb/></figure>

			<p>95.<lb/> The chemical industry is in a unique position as both a major industry sector in terms of energy<lb/> use and CO2 emissions and as a major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change (CEFIC (2008b);<lb/> KPMG International (2009b), pp.12-14). The chemical industry uses minerals and fossil hydrocarbons<lb/> (natural gas and oil) as raw materials which are transformed into more complex molecules and polymers.<lb/> Nearly 60% of total energy products (coal, oil products, natural gas, electricity and renewables) are used as<lb/> feedstock, and a little over 40% are used as fuel and power in the European chemical industry (CEFIC<lb/> (2009), p.32). The short-term profitability of the industry is directly linked to fluctuations in raw material<lb/> and energy prices, and in the long-run the sustainability of the current dependence upon non-renewable<lb/> fossil fuels as raw materials is increasingly questioned.<lb/> 96.<lb/> Extensive studies are underway about the possible use of biomass as a new source of feedstock<lb/> with a view to reducing the industry&apos;s reliance on fossil fuels. 92 One study (<ref type="biblio">Patel et al. 2006</ref>) on the<lb/> potential impact of use of biomass-derived feedstock to convert into organic bulk chemicals by means of<lb/> White Biotechnology (by fermentation or enzymatic conversion) found that up to two thirds of the current<lb/> non-renewable energy use for the production of the selected chemicals could be saved by 2050. Should this<lb/> projection become reality, significant technological breakthroughs are required as well as favourable<lb/> relative prices between fossil fuels and fermented sugar.<lb/> 97.<lb/> The demand for a more sustainable use of resources and mitigation of climate change impacts,<lb/> alongside the competition from emerging economies, further adds to the importance of innovation (HLG<lb/> (2009), p.11). 93 Policy measures such as the ETS will give incentives to the search for emission reducing<lb/> technologies (OECD (2009b), pp.63-64). At the same time, technology policy to harness creation of<lb/> environmental-friendly technologies 94 and an open trade policy to facilitate adoption of environmental-<lb/>91<lb/> &quot; And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make<lb/> clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill<lb/> last year. And this year I&apos;m eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the</p>

			<table>Senate. &quot; The State of the<lb/> Union Address by President Obama, January 2010.<lb/> 92<lb/> See e.g. European Commission (2008) (on biotechnology in Seventh Framework Programme of Research);<lb/> SusChem (2008).<lb/> 93<lb/> HLG (2009, p.25) pointed out the possibility of carbon leakage in chemicals sector should be taken into<lb/> account under the ETS Directive. On the other hand, OECD (2009b, Chapter 3) estimated that, while<lb/> insufficient participation in global carbon pricing policy can result in non-negligible carbon leakage (12%<lb/> leakage rates in 2050), broader participation will render the size of leakage much smaller (1.7%). Di Maria<lb/> and van der Werf (2008) further shows that induced technological change in energy saving technologies<lb/> will offset or at least mitigate the effect of carbon leakage. See WTO and UNEP (2009), pp.98-110 for a<lb/> survey of the issue and relevance to WTO rules.<lb/> 94<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Aghion et al. (2009)</ref> stresses that, in order to foster emergence of green innovation, climate change policy<lb/> should combine a carbon price with high initial clean-innovation R&amp;D subsidies, rather than relying solely<lb/> on carbon price, given the current carbon market under the ETS where the carbon price is low, highly<lb/> volatile and not predictable. <ref type="biblio">Popp et al. (2009, pp.4-5</ref>) also argues, based on various studies, that<lb/> environmental and technology policies work best in tandem. This is because while technology policy can<lb/> help creation of new environmental-friendly technologies, environmental policy should be in place to<lb/> encourage adoption of these technologies; on the other hand, it is suboptimal to raise emission tax above<lb/> the level necessary to account for the environmental externality, and targeted technology policy should<lb/> accomplish technology creation and spillovers.<lb/> friendly products and technologies will also play essential roles. 95 For example, electric power plants in<lb/> India have been using domestically produced coal because imports were virtually banned to protect the<lb/> domestic industry, but emissions could have been reduced by using high quality imported coal (<ref type="biblio">Khanna<lb/> and Zilberman, 2001</ref>). Another study further found that access to technologies, facilitated by openness to<lb/> international trade, further facilitates countries to adopt environmental regulation at lower levels of per<lb/> capita income (<ref type="biblio">Lovely and Popp, 2008</ref>). International effort, including trade liberalisation through WTO<lb/> negotiations, can play an important role to accelerate the diffusion of climate change mitigation<lb/> technologies (Newell (2008), pp.13-14). 96<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Intellectual property<lb/> i) The role of intellectual property in the chemicals industry<lb/></head>

			<p>98.<lb/> Intellectual property is an important resource generally and the availability of protection for this<lb/> resource can help to spur innovation; this is also the case with the chemicals sector. 97 For example, in basic<lb/> industrial chemicals, process technology is the key to cost leadership, and technology licensing has become<lb/> a business in its own right. Protection of brands is important especially for consumer chemicals where it<lb/> can contribute to brand loyalty and consumer protection. Various types of know-how (technical and<lb/> commercial) gained through experience are also valuable resources that merit protection.<lb/> 99.<lb/> But the characteristics of the chemical sector make intellectual property all the more important<lb/> because of the relative ease of producing many types of chemicals once the necessary technologies are<lb/> known (<ref type="biblio">Cesaroni et al. (2004)</ref>, p.126). Therefore, firms seek to protect as intellectual property their<lb/> knowledge concerning the composition and formulation of chemical products.<lb/> 100.<lb/> Technologies may be protected by patents or trade secrets, and both have been extensively used<lb/> throughout the history of the chemical industry, whereby the choice may depend on the nature of the<lb/> technology and the strategy in the specific situation. Some knowledge is relatively difficult to protect<lb/> through patents, particularly if it is difficult to codify. In some cases, disclosure requirements under patent<lb/> law may be seen as increasing the risk of imitation. A logical consequence of such considerations is for<lb/> firms to patent the technology which can be clearly articulated, and keep the rest as secret (<ref type="biblio">Arora (1997)</ref>,<lb/> p.393). In addition, development and defence of patents can be very resource intensive, which may<lb/> contribute to the lower propensity of smaller firms to patent their innovations.<lb/> 101.<lb/> Nevertheless, patents play an important role in allowing the chemical industry to protect and<lb/> utilise the innovation. For example, wide spread technology licensing by SEFs is facilitated by patents<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Arora (1997)</ref>, p.396). 98 Chemistry is one of the major areas of patented technology, representing 14% of<lb/> world patent applications (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). Individual firms may hold thousands of patents.</p>

			<figure>For example, in<lb/> 2008 DuPont alone filed over 1 900 US patent applications and was granted 495 patents; it currently holds<lb/> more than 6 000 active U.S. patents (ACC). Overall, the majority of patent applications in chemistry (2007)<lb/> take place in such areas as organic chemistry (4.7%), organic macromolecular compounds (2.4%) and<lb/> biochemistry (3.0%).<lb/> 95<lb/> WTO and UNEP (2009), pp.61-62.<lb/> 96<lb/> See also Chairman&apos;s summary at the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference (WT/MIN(09)/18, 2 December<lb/> 2009).<lb/> 97<lb/> See c.f., CEFIC (2008a).<lb/> 98<lb/> This is consistent with more general observation that stronger intellectual property rights have a positive<lb/> effect on technology transfer via licensing. See Park and Lippoldt (2005).<lb/></figure>

			<p>102.<lb/> Three quarters of patent applications in chemicals are made by the United States, Japan and<lb/> Germany. While these countries lead the field with respect to patents, in recent years new entrants, such as<lb/> India, Korea and China, have gained weight especially in organic and fine chemistry. International R&amp;D<lb/> cooperation is gradually gaining ground in these areas, as the ratio of co-patenting (the patents with at least<lb/> one foreign co-inventor) stood at around 12% and has been edging up since the 1990s (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>). There<lb/> are considerable variations in the pattern of co-invention across countries. In general, countries with larger<lb/> number of patents are lower in their ratio of co-invention. Countries that tend to be relatively low in their<lb/> tendency to co-invention include for example Japan, India and Korea; China is a contrasting example, with<lb/> a large volume of patent applications, whereby almost half resulted from co-invention (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>).<lb/> 103.<lb/> An econometric analysis (Appendix 2) shows that the number of patent applications has certain<lb/> correlations with export and import patterns, and that co-patenting is positively related to bilateral trade.<lb/> The dynamics between co-invention and trade flows appear to be different in different sub-segments, but it<lb/> may imply in practice that collaborative efforts leading up to patent application may foster trade flows, or<lb/> trade flows and collaborative innovation are mutually reinforcing and go hand-in-hand (especially in basic<lb/> materials).<lb/> 104.<lb/> The high ratio of co-invention in China may be explained as a natural development, but it appears<lb/> that it may also be driven by policy. In China, preferential tax treatment is provided to those who offer<lb/> intellectual property, R&amp;D capabilities or advanced technology (PwC (2008a), p.5). On the other hand, this<lb/> is sometimes viewed as a requirement to establish a large scale R&amp;D facility, that is a significant cost that<lb/> comes with entry into China (PwC (2008a), p.12), which may inhibit inward investment.<lb/></p>

			<head>ii) Problems with protection and infringement<lb/></head>

			<p>105.<lb/> Since the TRIPS Agreement entered into force in 1995, developing countries have undertaken<lb/> significant reforms in their intellectual property systems (<ref type="biblio">Park and Lippoldt (2008)</ref>, p.18). For example,<lb/> patent protection for pharmaceuticals, food and chemical based products in India under the Patent Act of<lb/> 1970 was limited to process patents; product patents were not available for these sectors. As this allowed<lb/> &quot; reverse engineering &quot; of drugs patented elsewhere, it effectively kept new drugs by multinationals out of<lb/> the Indian market, and this in turn gave the indigenous pharmaceutical production an opportunity to take<lb/> root (<ref type="biblio">Prahalathan and Baruah (2007)</ref>, p.47-51). The Patent Act of 2005 changed this domestic rule and<lb/> extended the scope of product patent to those sectors to be in line with the TRIPS Agreement (ibid.,<lb/> p.64). 99<lb/> 106.<lb/> Despite these major improvements in statutory protection, implementation remains a source of<lb/> concern. 100 One survey shows that intellectual property infringement is one of the major types of economic<lb/> crime and it tends to result in big losses – over 30% of the relevant IP infringements imposed costs of more<lb/> than 10 million USD on western European companies. In the chemicals industry, a typical incident of<lb/> infringement happens when a business partner utilises technology obtained from another partner (e.g.<lb/> through a joint venture) and often involves production processes and technologies (PwC (2008b), p.3).<lb/> 107.<lb/> In this respect, much attention has been directed to China (e.g. European Commission 2009b; US<lb/> Department of Commerce, note 100). Despite efforts to strengthen its intellectual property rights<lb/> 99<lb/> The Patent Act of 2005 contains an additional &quot; improved efficacy &quot; requirement for patentability of<lb/> pharmaceuticals, which is being challenged by Novartis, following a patent rejection under this rule in<lb/> 2006. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2009. See e.g. Bate (2007).<lb/></figure>

			<table>100<lb/> See e.g. US Department of Commerce, Protecting Your Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in China: A<lb/> Practical Guide for U.S. Companies<lb/> &lt;http://www.mac.doc.gov/China/Docs/businessguides/IntellectualPropertyRights.htm&gt;.<lb/></table>

			<p>enforcement since its accession to the WTO in 2001 and as technology transfer becomes more important<lb/> for domestic companies, multinational companies operating in China attach high importance to further<lb/> improvement of intellectual property protection. One survey shows that those multinationals often<lb/> purposefully exclude vital parts or designs from processes in China, or strive to maintain a marketing<lb/> reputation to make it difficult to replicate and undercut, and thus protect their intellectual property. Such<lb/> strategies have proven relatively effective. On the other hand, protection through recourse to patent and<lb/> trademark law or non-disclosure agreements with key employees are often used, but the survery shows that<lb/> their effectiveness does not necessarily match expectations (von <ref type="biblio">Keller et al. (2005)</ref>, pp.26-27).<lb/> 108.<lb/> In the chemicals industry as well, multinationals have found it necessary to actively defend their<lb/> intellectual properties in China (KPMG International (2009c), p.15). Many foreign investors take such<lb/> precautions as creating firewalls between different steps of the production process, or refrain from sharing<lb/> key technologies in a joint venture (PwC (2008b), p.12). These additional efforts to protect intellectual<lb/> properties mitigate some of the potentially positive effects of statutory strengthening (e.g. on technology<lb/> transfer) and divert resources away from innovative activities. The impact is particularly serious for<lb/> smaller firms.<lb/> 109.<lb/> Finally, counterfeiting of chemical products can have serious consequences (e.g. HLG (2009),<lb/> p.15). For example, counterfeit fertilisers and pesticides have caused vast damage to the environment, and<lb/> they are often difficult to distinguish from legitimate products even for experts. Cases have been reported<lb/> of the destruction of harvests in large areas in China, Russia, Ukraine and Italy due to the use of counterfeit<lb/> chemicals. There are also concerns for health and safety (OECD (2008d), pp.138 and 148; ECPA (2008)).<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Recent developments<lb/></head>

			<p>110.<lb/> Since the financial crisis in late 2008, the chemicals industry has been no exception in<lb/> experiencing a decline in trade (-24.6%, 2009Q2) 101 , although the rate of decline has been less than for the<lb/> manufacturing sector as a whole (-29.9%). This sudden turn in economic fortune provoked fears of<lb/> possible serious protectionist reactions, and against this background G20 leaders declared &quot; within the next<lb/> 12 months, we will refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services,<lb/> imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent<lb/> measures to stimulate exports &quot; . 102 This was reaffirmed at subsequent summits in <ref type="biblio">London and Pittsburgh in<lb/> 2009.<lb/></ref> 111.<lb/> Active monitoring activities of trade-related measures ensued, most notably at the WTO. It<lb/> estimates that the value of total affected imports was 1% of the world trade (<ref type="biblio">October 2008 – October 2009).<lb/> WTO et al. (2010)</ref> notes &quot; <ref type="biblio">[i]</ref>n the period since September 2009, there has been continued slippage towards<lb/> more trade-restricting and distorting policies by many G20 members, although there has been a slight<lb/> slowdown in the number of measures implemented more recently compared with the period immediately<lb/> after the outbreak of the global crisis &quot; (p.20). In this general context, however, chemicals and plastics are<lb/> among the industries most affected by recently introduced trade-related measures (Tables 9-10),<lb/> comprising 8% of affected import value (other most affected industries include agricultural products, iron<lb/> and steel, footwear, textiles and clothing, consumer electronics, and motor vehicles and parts).</p>

			<figure>Out of 247<lb/> anti-dumping initiations between October 2008 and October 2009, metals have been the most targeted<lb/> goods followed by chemicals (58) and plastics (30). A similar pattern is observed with countervailing duty<lb/> investigations: out of 28 investigations initiated in 2009, 12 covered metals followed by plastics (4) and<lb/> chemicals (3). In terms of safeguard, among 27 initiations in 2009, chemicals (7) was the most affected<lb/> 101<lb/> The information in this and the following paragraphs is taken from WTO (2009b), except otherwise noted.<lb/> 102<lb/> Declaration: Summit on Financial <ref type="biblio">Markets and World Economy, 15 November 2008, Washington.<lb/></ref> sector, followed by cement/glass/ceramics (6). It is worth noting also that this sectoral pattern of protection<lb/> is broadly consistent with the historical pattern.<lb/> 112.<lb/> On export measures, WTO (2010c) observes &quot; an increasing trend in the use of export restrictions,<lb/> affecting in particular food products and commodities &quot; , while acknowledging that a few countries also<lb/> took measures to reduce the coverage of previously implemented export restrictions (para.46). 103<lb/> 113.<lb/> These recent developments exemplify both values and limits to the existing multilateral trade<lb/> disciplines. They have not stopped countries from taking these measures, but at the same time multilateral<lb/> rules have shown resilience in this period of exceptional economic stress and maintained credibility as a<lb/> multilateral &quot; insurance policy &quot; against the spread of protectionist reactions. This further underlines the<lb/> importance of these monitoring activities to ensure transparency and to seek an ambitious and balanced<lb/> conclusion of the Doha Development Round. 104<lb/></p>

			<head>V.<lb/> Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>114.<lb/> This study has highlighted the various linkages between trade and innovation in the chemicals<lb/> sector. First, the transfer of advanced technologies, both as embodied in capital goods as well as through<lb/> technology licensing, has been the key to the emergence of the chemicals industry as a global industry. In<lb/> particular, the SEFs (specialised engineering firms) have played a unique role especially in basic industrial<lb/> chemicals in technology spillovers, initially from the United States to Europe and to Japan and more<lb/> recently to emerging economies.<lb/> 115.<lb/> Second, product innovation in the chemicals sector, especially in speciality and fine chemicals,<lb/> contributes to innovation in downstream sectors, and trade serves as an essential conduit to transmit such<lb/> innovations across borders.<lb/> 116.<lb/> Thirdly, as a consequence of wider availability of technologies across the globe, technology<lb/> leaders in developed countries are under increasing competitive pressure from new competitors, which<lb/> induces further innovation. The basic industrial chemicals sector has undergone continuous re-organisation<lb/> with some companies now refocusing on speciality and fine chemicals. In speciality and fine chemicals,<lb/> the product life cycle has been markedly shortened, and innovative capacity is an important factor in<lb/> determining corporate performance in recent years.<lb/> 117.<lb/> Fourth, exports can also be important not just to exploit economies of scale, but foreign contacts<lb/> can give suppliers innovative ideas, especially for speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals.<lb/> The increasing strength of emerging markets is a challenge but it is also offering opportunities for<lb/> innovation.<lb/> 118.<lb/> Finally, joint ventures and cross border M&amp;A also work as channels of technology transfer.<lb/> China has been attracting foreign multinationals as partners in joint ventures in China, and Indian<lb/> companies are active in acquiring chemical companies in the developed countries. At least part of the<lb/> motivation is considered to be access to advanced technologies.<lb/> 119.<lb/> In terms of policy issues, this study has addressed tariff, regulation and intellectual property.<lb/> Tariffs have declined substantially as a result of the Uruguay Round and autonomous tariff reductions, but<lb/> remaining tariffs are still non-negligible and work as a trade impediment. Successful conclusion of the<lb/> DDA negotiations is expected to play an important role in promoting trade liberalisation by bound tariff<lb/> reduction. Export restrictive measures on raw materials are also an important concern in this sector, and<lb/> proposals have been tabled to enhance transparency of these measures in the DDA negotiations.<lb/> 120.<lb/> The chemicals sector is a heavily regulated sector both domestically and internationally. Under<lb/> WTO rules regulations may be considered legitimate if certain conditions are met. Many domestic<lb/> regulations have been notified to the WTO according to the procedure provided in the TBT Agreement,<lb/> and there have been over 1 600 notifications since 1995 in the chemicals sector. The impact of regulation<lb/> on innovation can go either way, and it is likely to be specific to the regulatory design. Many major players<lb/> in this sector have been pursuing regulatory initiatives to enhance data collection and to extend regulatory<lb/> coverage to existing chemicals in recent years. Their practical impact remains to be seen, since they are<lb/> still at an early stage of implementation or preparation. In relation to climate change issues, the chemicals<lb/> sector is in a unique position as both a major sector in terms of energy use and CO2 emissions and as a<lb/> major contributor to deliver solutions to climate change.<lb/> 121.<lb/> Intellectual property has particular importance in the chemicals sector because of the relative ease<lb/> of producing chemicals as soon as the necessary technologies are known. Throughout the history of the<lb/> chemicals industry, both patents and trade secrets have been used extensively depending on the nature of<lb/> technology and strategy. Patents have been instrumental in facilitating technology transfer by licensing.<lb/> The practice of co-patenting is generally correlated with trade flows, indicating the possibility that trade<lb/> relations work as a precursor to more long term collaborative innovation. Infringement of intellectual<lb/> property continues to be a major problem that tends to incur high amount of losses to the intellectual<lb/> property holders. Many multinational companies operating in China have taken various measures to protect<lb/> their intellectual property, despite efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights enforcement by Chinese<lb/> government.<lb/> 122.<lb/> Finally, as acknowledged at the OECD Council at Ministerial Level in 2007, to strengthen<lb/> innovation performance and its contribution to growth, a strategic and comprehensive cross-government<lb/> policy approach is required, and openness to trade is an essential element of the framework conditions that<lb/> are necessary to stimulate innovation. The OECD Innovation Strategy (OECD, 2010a) is an important<lb/> contribution to policymaking on broader aspects of innovation policy.<lb/> and USTR &lt;http://www.ustr.gov/trade-topics/industry-manufacturing/industry-initiatives&gt; websites.

			<p>(1) R&amp;D expenditures, production values and patent data are taken from OECD STAN Database for<lb/> Structural Analysis, the STAN R&amp;D Expenditure in Industry (ISIC Rev. 3) ANBERD ed2009, and OECD<lb/> Patent Database.<lb/></p>

			<figure>(2) Patent data represent the number of patent applications under Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).<lb/> &quot; Chemistry &quot; in Figure 13 refers to technology areas C01-C14 in International Patent Classification (IPC),<lb/> and &quot; Metallurgy &quot; refers to the rest of Section C. Although PCT applications facilitate international<lb/> comparison of patent statistics, the period up to 2000 is a transition period that needs to be interpreted with<lb/> care (OECD (2009a), p.66).<lb/> (3) Technology classifications in Figures 14-15 are in reference to &quot; new concept of technology<lb/> classification &quot; in Schmoch (2008), p.9.<lb/> APPENDIX 2. TRADE PATTERNS AND CO-INVENTION<lb/> a) The Model<lb/> To test the impact of tariffs and patent application on trade flows, the estimation has been based on<lb/> the gravity model with fixed effects after Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) adapted in Portugal-Perez<lb/> et al. (2009). The specification here is:<lb/> ln(import) ijt = ln(1 + tariff rates) ijt + ln(patent, importer) it + ln(patent, exporter) jt + ln(patent, co-<lb/>invention) ijt + D ij + x i + y j + (w t )+ e ijt<lb/></figure>

			<p>For importer i, exporter j and year t, with fixed effects in the importer (x), exporter (y) and product (w)<lb/> dimensions. D covers distance, common language dummy and contiguous (common border) dummy. The<lb/> estimation is done with respect to three sub-sectors.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Portugal-Perez et al. (2009)</ref> tested the impact of international standards and tariffs on trade flows with<lb/> similar control variables, but patent applications may also be associated with trade flows. If patent<lb/> applications represent export competitiveness, exporters&apos; patent application should have positive signs, and<lb/> if patent applications reflect absorptive capacity of foreign technology, importers&apos; patent application<lb/> should have positive signs. If cross-border co-invention (patent applications filed with foreign inventors)<lb/> represents global collaborative networks which cover both technological exchanges and trade in goods, it<lb/> should have a positive sign. Causation between co-invention and trade flows can further be tested by<lb/> changing the timing of co-invention (one-year lag and one-year lead) in the estimation.<lb/></p>

But in practice, when<lb/> collaborative activities leading up to joint patent application is taken into account, such efforts may have a<lb/> positive implication in fostering trade relations.<lb/> The results point to strong relationship between cross border collaborative networks and trade flows<lb/> within each technology areas, but it does not capture such relationship across different industrial segments.<lb/> Exporters&apos; patent application is generally positively correlated with trade flows, but statistically<lb/> significant only for basic materials. Importers&apos; patent application is generally negatively correlated with<lb/> trade flows, but statistical significance varies (statistically significant when estimated with &quot; co-patent<lb/> (lead) &quot; ).<lb/> Negative impact of tariffs is statistically significant 107 , and the signs of other control variables<lb/> (distance, language and contiguity) are also as expected. The levels of coefficients vary considerably<lb/> across different sub-sectors.<lb/></p>

			<p>R&amp;D is positively associated with exports in all manufacturing sectors, both in the 1990s and 2000s.<lb/> It was the case with chemicals, but it is not statistically significant in the 2000s.<lb/> R&amp;D is positively associated with imports in all manufacturing sectors in both periods, but the impact<lb/> is much smaller than with exports. It was positively associated in chemicals in 1990s but not any longer in<lb/> 2000s.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other factors than R&amp;D within the chemicals sector may have become more important for<lb/> comparative advantage of the chemicals in 2000s. For example, introduction of the fruits of R&amp;D<lb/> generated by other industries and/or from abroad through technology licensing or imports of superior<lb/> capital goods or intermediate goods, rather than domestic R&amp;D within the sector, may have become more<lb/> important.<lb/></p>

			<head>(ii) Trade, R&amp;D and Protection<lb/></head>

			<p>R&amp;D and exports are both negatively associated with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors. In<lb/> other words, comparative advantage and the underlying R&amp;D capacity are associated with lower tariff<lb/> levels. But if both of them are controlled, R&amp;D tends to lose statistical significance.<lb/> In chemicals in 1990s, the signs for R&amp;D and exports were both positive, but they turned negative in<lb/> the 2000s, but without statistical significance.<lb/> Imports have no statistically significant association with tariff levels in all manufacturing sectors.<lb/> Imports tended to have positive association with tariff levels in chemicals.<lb/></p>

			<p>Positive association between R&amp;D and tariffs may imply a policy to compliment lesser R&amp;D capacity<lb/> by imports, and negative association may imply a policy to protect sectors with lesser R&amp;D capacity. But<lb/> from this simple test of association, clear evidence does not emerge in either direction.<lb/></p>
