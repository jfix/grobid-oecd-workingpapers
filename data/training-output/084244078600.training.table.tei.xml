Combined with large productivity<lb/> gains in the manufacturing sector, this reduced Sweden&apos;s relative unit labour costs in manufacturing by<lb/> almost 30%. Swedish exporters used part of the resultant boost to competitiveness to lower their foreign-<lb/>currency prices, except for in resource-intensive industries (OECD, 1995). Swedish export shares also<lb/> benefited from a favourable composition of world demand, based on a relatively high content of<lb/> infrequently purchased goods, such as passenger cars and household appliances, which had a high weight<lb/> in Swedish exports. Recovering economies such as the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States and<lb/> East Asian countries markedly increased their imports of such goods from Sweden, Furthermore, this<lb/> composition of exports allowed Sweden to benefit disproportionately from emerging markets. from technological development, while globalisation (leading to increased specialisation) may have<lb/> spurred export performance in specific industries. 9<lb/> 13.<lb/> Traditionally, Sweden&apos;s main trading partners have been Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway,<lb/> the United Kingdom and the United States, which together account for around 50% of total goods export.<lb/> International trade with emerging economies such as China plays a growing role.
