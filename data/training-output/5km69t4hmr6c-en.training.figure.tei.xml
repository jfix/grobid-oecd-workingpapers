The Patent Act of 2005 changed this domestic rule and<lb/> extended the scope of product patent to those sectors to be in line with the TRIPS Agreement (ibid.,<lb/> p.64). 99<lb/> 106.<lb/> Despite these major improvements in statutory protection, implementation remains a source of<lb/> concern. 100 One survey shows that intellectual property infringement is one of the major types of economic<lb/> crime and it tends to result in big losses – over 30% of the relevant IP infringements imposed costs of more<lb/> than 10 million USD on western European companies. In the chemicals industry, a typical incident of<lb/> infringement happens when a business partner utilises technology obtained from another partner (e.g.<lb/> through a joint venture) and often involves production processes and technologies (PwC (2008b), p.3).<lb/> 107.<lb/> In this respect, much attention has been directed to China (e.g. European Commission 2009b; US<lb/> Department of Commerce, note 100). Despite efforts to strengthen its intellectual property rights<lb/> 99<lb/> The Patent Act of 2005 contains an additional &quot; improved efficacy &quot; requirement for patentability of<lb/> pharmaceuticals, which is being challenged by Novartis, following a patent rejection under this rule in<lb/> 2006.
