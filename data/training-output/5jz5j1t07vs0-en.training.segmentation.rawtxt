societal goals in re-distribution and social welfare, recognise the influence taxation has on businesses' 
competitiveness and adequately address environmental externalities is a tough challenge, arguably more so 
in Israel than in many other OECD countries. High interest payments and large defence spending make 
deficit and debt reduction more difficult, socio-economic divides remain wide and as a small-open 
economy Israel is highly exposed to mobile international capital and competition over international 
investment. And, as elsewhere, the incorporation of environmental issues into the tax system remains only 
partial. This review examines ways forward for policy on several fronts: indirect taxation; household 
income tax and social benefits; taxes on property and wealth; business taxation; and evasion, avoidance 
and administration issues. This Working Paper relates to the 2013 OECD Economic Review of Israel (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-israel.htm).

recettes suffisantes pour réaliser les objectifs budgétaires retenus à l'échelle macroéconomique, d'atteindre 
les objectifs sociétaux visés en termes de redistribution et de protection sociale, de prendre en compte 
l'influence exercée par la fiscalité sur la compétitivité des entreprises, et de gérer de manière adéquate les 
externalités environnementales. L'ampleur de la tâche est redoutable, et elle l'est sans doute encore plus en 
Israël que dans de nombreux autres pays de l'OCDE. La lourdeur des charges d'intérêts et le volume des 
dépenses de défense rendent la réduction du déficit et de la dette plus difficile, les fractures 
socioéconomiques restent larges et, en tant que petite économie ouverte, Israël est fortement exposée aux 
effets de la mobilité des capitaux internationaux et à la concurrence que se livrent les pays pour attirer les 
investissements internationaux. En outre, comme ailleurs, l'intégration des questions environnementales 
dans le système d'imposition reste partielle. Nous examinons dans cette Étude les possibilités d'améliorer 
le cadre d'action publique sur plusieurs fronts : les impôts indirects, la fiscalité des revenus des ménages et 
le système de prestations sociales, les impôts sur la propriété immobilière et les autres formes de 
patrimoine, la fiscalité des entreprises, les problèmes de fraude et d'évasion fiscales, ainsi que les questions

including achieving deficit and debt targets, creating a competitive business environment and assisting 
low-income households. Given the multiple facets of tax and transfer policies, making the most of 
'win-win' opportunities and having a good gauge of the trade-offs where these occur are key to good 
policymaking. In Israel, past and renewed efforts to reduce public indebtedness, while making the tax 
system more conducive to growth in an environment of high interest payments, large defence-spending 
commitments and significant socio-economic divides mean the authorities have long been keenly aware of 
the challenges. This paper evaluates current policies and plans for the future and concludes with a series of 
recommendations. Notable features of the system Israeli policymakers have pushed tax and transfer reforms a long way in some dimensions, most 
notably away from direct taxation and towards both indirect taxation and parsimonious social welfare 
payments: @BULLET Until 2011 the authorities had been cutting statutory rates of direct taxation on households and 
businesses as part of a strategy of containing the 'size' of government and making the tax 
environment more business friendly. Up to 2007, total tax revenues as a share of GDP had been 
close to the OECD average, but they have since dropped markedly, reflecting, in part, the effects 
of reductions in personal-income tax (PIT) and corporate-income tax (CIT) (Figure 1, Panels A 
and B). However, this created difficulties of squaring goals in public-debt reduction with 
spending commitments, and the 2011 'tent protests' saw increased political opposition; as a 
result, the scheduled cuts in the CIT and upper rates of PIT were halted. Since then, rates in both 
these tax bases have been increased as part of efforts to contain fiscal deficits, but also in 
response to perceived injustices in the burden of taxation raised by the protests. 1. 
Philip Hemmings is a senior economist in the Country Studies Branch in the Economics Department of the 
OECD; e-mail: philip.hemmings@oecd.org. This paper was prepared for the OECD Economic Survey of 
Israel published in December 2013 under the authority of the Economic and Development Review 
Committee. The author is particularly thankful to Andrew Dean, Bob Ford and Peter Jarrett and Israeli 
government officials for their valuable comments and suggestions. Special thanks are due to 
Françoise Correia for excellent statistical assistance and Mee-Lan Frank for technical preparation. ECO/WKP(2014)9 6 @BULLET Indirect and property tax revenues are high as a share of GDP in international comparison 
(Figure 1, Panel C). Value-added tax (VAT) accounts for the lion's share of indirect tax revenues, 
and a municipally administered tax on housing and commercial buildings accounts for the vast 
majority of property tax. Alongside the usual 'sin taxes' on tobacco and alcohol, there are 
specific customs duties or purchase taxes on many consumer durables and food items. The tent 
protests prompted cancellations or reductions in many of these. However, some substantial 
specific indirect taxes remain, including a heavy purchase tax on cars (though this has been given 
an environmental dimension in recent years), and new taxes on some luxury items have recently 
been introduced. @BULLET As for civilian public spending as a whole, spending on welfare transfers to households is low in 
international comparison. This is partly explained by Israel's somewhat faster economic growth 
and lower unemployment rate than in many other OECD countries, particularly in recent years. 
But the low level of spending also reflects broader efforts to limit the scale of total public 
spending in the context of high debt-service costs and defence spending. Arguably, the level of 
public spending also reflects a 'supply side' policy view by successive governments, in particular 
a wariness of cash benefits because of their potential to create welfare traps that discourage 
employment. The low level of social spending can be seen both in the share of social spending in 
GDP (Figure 1, Panel D) and in comparisons of the tax-benefit positions of different sorts of 
households. The tent protests nevertheless led to more generous tax breaks for households with 
children and commitments to provide free childcare and early education services. @BULLET For businesses the landscape is a familiar one. The statutory corporate-tax rate is combined with 
various allowances (for instance, on R&D outlays and capital depreciation), plus targeted tax 
breaks and other support aimed at larger businesses and a menu of programmes supporting small-
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The centrepiece of support is legislation that includes 
substantially lower corporate tax rates for internationally competitive businesses. As elsewhere, 
tax revenues from corporate profits are modest compared with those on labour and on goods and 
services and fluctuate considerably over the business cycle. However, based on an average of the 
past seven years, CIT revenues as a share of GDP compare favourably with elsewhere (Figure 1, 
Panel C), suggesting that the effective rate is perhaps somewhat higher. ECO/WKP(2014)9 7 Figure 1. Tax revenue and social spending indicators As a percentage of GDP 1.

Key challenges The challenges for tax and transfer policy can be seen as having four inter-related components: @BULLET Identifying the best (or rather least damaging) revenue-raising measures and cutbacks in public 
spending to achieve targets in deficit and debt reduction. A package of measures as part of the 
recent 2013-14 budget was the latest initiative to this end. @BULLET Enhancing the role played by the tax and transfer system in achieving a socially acceptable 
distribution of income and, in particular, in relieving Israel's chronic problems of poverty and 
weak labour-force attachment in certain communities. High poverty rates and low employment 
rates, particularly in the rapidly growing Haredi community and the Arab-Israeli sector, remain a 1995

though Israel already has a reasonably pro-growth tax structure, further improvement on this 
front, particularly in the context of competition with other countries for international investment, 
needs to remain a policy priority. @BULLET Improving the environmental features of the tax system. Despite progress in 'greening' some 
existing tax bases and the introduction of dedicated environmental taxes, as in most countries 
there is room for further action on this front. The following sections first summarise the recent history of tax and benefit reforms and then discuss 
how policy has addressed the above issues and the best way forward under five headings: indirect taxation; 
household income tax and social benefits; taxes on property and wealth; business taxation; and evasion, 
avoidance and administration issues. Background: the recent history of tax and transfer measures There have been three recent packages of tax and spending measures. The first followed up the 
recommendations of the Trajtenberg Committee that was set up in 2011 in response to the tent protests and 
aimed to be fiscally neutral. PIT progressivity was notched up, capital was taxed more heavily, and 
customs duties were rationalised on consumer durables and food with a view to lowering retail prices 
(Table 1). Second, by mid-2012 it had become clear that fiscal balances were going seriously off target, 
prompting revenue-raising measures that included a rise in the standard rate of VAT and further increases 
in top-end PIT rates. This was followed in the 2013-14 budget by further measures as part of the significant 
consolidation to bring the deficit back on target. This latest round of changes includes many revenue 
measures and transfer savings, including additional hikes in the VAT, CIT and PIT rates and cuts in child 
allowances. Indirect tax Indirect taxes have some attractive features. Theory and evidence suggests they are preferable to 
direct taxes in terms of economic growth (for instance, Arnold, 2008), as they favour saving and 
investment and have a smaller impact on business costs and profits. Also, for those goods and services 
where there is inelastic consumer demand (or producer supply), there are opportunities for reliable 
revenues with comparatively low deadweight losses in economic welfare. Indirect taxes can also 
'internalise' externalities, in particular those connected with the environment and public health. Of course 
there are potential downsides: they can be a vehicle for protectionism, distort household consumption and 
saving behaviour and can be regressive. Israel has long made heavy use of indirect taxation. Indeed, at least since the mid-1990s revenues 
from taxes on goods and services have been among the highest in the OECD area both as a share of GDP 
and of overall revenues (Figure 2). In revenue terms, VAT is by far the largest single item. Other indirect 
taxes are by no means insignificant, however, representing about 37% of all indirect tax and nearly 4% of 
GDP in 2011 (Table 2). They are practically all targeted on specific goods and services in one way or 
another and comprise various sales taxes, customs duties, excises and fees. Excise on fuels is the largest 
component, accounting for about 45% of this class of revenues. ECO/WKP(2014)9 9 Table 1. Key tax and benefit measures since the tent-protests of 2011 Response to the tent protests

12.1 Source: OECD Revenue Statistics. A good system of VAT Israel's VAT system is admirable in that there is a single rate with few exemptions. As a result, 
revenues (both as a share of GDP and of total revenues) have been consistently above the OECD average, 
despite the comparatively modest standard rate (Figure 3); thus, the VAT Revenue Ratio is high (this ratio 
is derived by dividing actual revenues by the revenues implied by applying the standard VAT rate to total 
household consumption). 1995

VAT/GST and Excise Rates, Trends and Administration Issues, OECD Publishing. Multiple rates of VAT (with 'preferential' rates alongside the standard rate) and more widespread 
exemptions should be avoided. In contrast to the Israeli case, many OECD countries' VAT systems have 
become complicated because of such provisions. In principle, preferential rates and exemptions can be 
used to address equity issues and correct for externalities. However, as pointed out in the OECD's 
Consumption Tax Trends (OECD, 2012a), in general they are not the best tools for the job. As means of 
addressing income inequality and poverty inefficiency arises because exemptions and preferential rates 
benefit all households, including the affluent. Similarly, targeting environmental externalities via VAT can 
be a blunt instrument as it may not accurately impact the source of the externality; for instance, reduced 
rates on energy-saving appliances may boost demand and stimulate use, thus denting the intended curbing 
of energy consumption. In addition, despite possibly good intentions, creating a subset of items benefitting 
from preferential rates or exemptions almost inevitably gives rise to anomalies, complications, additional 
administrative costs and the attention of lobby groups. It is worth noting that while there is only a single 1995

Comparison with top ten OECD countries ECO/WKP(2014)9 12 VAT rate in Israel, the retail prices of quite a number of basic food items are regulated, so there is some 
official attention to affordability issues, although price regulation is not the best solution. Indeed, the authorities should consider making VAT coverage even wider by removing the remaining 
exemptions; fruit and vegetables along with services in the tourist centre of Eilat. Although they are hard to 
justify on economic grounds, they remain fully VAT exempt, despite several proposals to eliminate them, 
including during the development of the fiscal budget for 2013-14. Raising the rate of VAT is in many respects a logical choice for increasing revenues. Indeed, it was 
raised from 16 to 17% in 2012 and to 18% in 2013. As mentioned, VAT is more growth friendly than other 
taxes, and relatively modest rate increases can yield sizeable additional revenues. For instance, a 
1 percentage-point increase is reckoned to add around NIS 4 billion (i.e. around 0.4 percentage point of 
GDP). Should substantial additional revenues be required to reach the fiscal targets, then further increases 
in VAT may well be among the best options. However, such a move would no doubt raise concerns about 
the impact on the cost of living of low-income households. As underscored above, addressing this through 
exemptions or preferential rates of VAT would be a poor strategy. Instead, consideration could be given to 
providing offsetting measures in welfare policy. Welcome reductions in the taxation of specific consumer durables and food items Israel has historically made heavy use of supplementary forms of indirect taxation (purchase taxes, 
customs and excise duties). Limited trade with neighbouring economies, tightly controlled points of entry 
to the country and a low risk of retaliation from trading partners due to the economy's relatively small size 
have made these attractive tax bases for the treasury and a vehicle for protecting domestic production. Over time, the number of these supplementary taxes has been reduced, and the rates of tax or duty 
have been lowered on those that remain. Complaints about the cost of living that were a key issue in the 
tent protests of 2011 have prompted the government to undertake further rationalisation: @BULLET Customs duties on consumer durables have been completely abolished. Previously, consumer 
durable items under 21 tariff codes, ranging from microwave ovens to hairdryers, were subject to 
customs duties typically at a rate of either 10 or 12%. @BULLET Customs duties on food products where there is significant local production are undergoing 
scheduled cuts that are typically due to be completed in 2015. These were very high on some 
items and for many will remain significant, even when the reductions are fully implemented. For 
example, duty on beef products was previously 190% but will only drop to 90%; similarly, the 
duty on lamb will drop from 50 to 30% and on sausages from 50 to 22%. Clearly, and 
unfortunately, there is reluctance to remove this dimension of agricultural support entirely. @BULLET Reductions in customs duties on food items that the authorities have classified as having limited 
local production have already been completed. The rates on these items vary widely such as fish 
(cut from 5 to 3 shekels per kilo) and dried fruit (reduced from 25 to 8%). @BULLET Customs duties on processed food are also undergoing scheduled reductions. This is an encouraging development. Taxing imported consumer goods may be perceived as 
preferable to taxing domestic production, but this point can be overstated as bringing imported goods to 
customers often involves a sizeable domestic supply chain. Also, such taxes distort consumption patterns, 
unless the price elasticity of demand for the products is zero. The customs duties on food are one of several 
elements in Israel's substantial and costly support for domestic agriculture (OECD, 2013a) (see below). ECO/WKP(2014)9 13 This said the 2013-14 budget introduced new purchase taxes of 15 to 20% on several high-end, luxury 
consumer goods, specifically airplanes, fur clothing, yachts and jet skis. Also, the car purchase tax has 
been increased for high-end vehicles. This somewhat arbitrary selection of items for additional taxation 
represents a largely symbolic gesture at taxing the rich; it is unlikely to raise much revenue or have 
anything but a marginal impact on the progressivity of the tax system. Vehicle taxation: there is room for a better balanced system Israel's vehicle taxation is among the heaviest in the OECD. Excise plus VAT on gasoline and diesel 
is similar to the levels in many European countries (Figure 4). But, what really distinguishes Israel is the 
hefty purchase tax imposed on cars, second only to that in Denmark. The high cost of purchasing and 
running cars for private individuals plus generous tax treatment of company cars has led to a 
disproportionate number of company cars, though recent reforms have seen some downward adjustment 
(see below). Figure 4.Taxes on gasoline 2013 Q1¹ 1.

differentiation of the car purchase tax according to environmental criteria is welcome, but arguably the 
range of rates should be shifted down. For decades a single, and very high, rate of purchase tax was 
imposed on private vehicles, and then in 2009 a system was introduced that maintained a high 'basic' 
purchase tax but with discounts calculated from a  " green credit "  based on the vehicle's emissions 
characteristics. The credit is a weighted average using emission levels and shadow-price estimates for a 
range of pollutants, and this is used to classify vehicles into categories that determine the discounts from 
the baseline purchase tax. The discounts do not exactly equate with shadow costs, thus departing from pure 
environmental taxation. Indeed, following substantial behavioural responses in terms of car purchase, the 
authorities have been lowering the discounts, one official justification being that this helps push consumers 0.0

TUR B. Tax on gasoline ² (USD PPP per litre) ECO/WKP(2014)9 14 (and importers) towards cleaner cars. However, it is clear that the authorities also have revenues very much 
in mind. For instance, a round of adjustments was made as part of fiscal consolidation measures in 2012, 
and another one features in the 2013-14 budget. The bottom line is that the purchase tax, net of discounts, 
remains high. Generally, effective tax rates range between 30 and 83%, averaging about 60% (hybrid cars 
are taxed at a 30% flat rate, plug-in hybrids 20% and fully electrical cars 8%). Aside from being a source 
of revenue there is little merit to such heavy taxation: the distortion in relative prices is substantial, and on 
environmental grounds it makes more sense to target car use rather than ownership. The authorities have 
moved somewhat in the opposite direction on this front with the introduction of the higher basic rate of 
purchase tax on high-end vehicles (applying to vehicles with a pre-tax price of more than NIS 300 000). One way of increasing the focus of taxation on vehicle use is via the tax on retail gasoline and diesel. 
Benchmarking Israeli levels of retail gasoline and diesel tax against those elsewhere suggests there is some 
headroom to raise them further while remaining within the range of international experience (Figure 4). 
However, as illustrated in the 2011 Economic Survey (OECD, 2011a), justifying middle-to-high tax 
burdens on retail gasoline and diesel on purely environmental grounds either requires an assumption of a 
very high implied price of carbon or taking on board additional externalities (and it may be difficult to 
argue that fuel-based tax is the best way to internalise some of them). In short, pushing up excise on fuels 
is certainly a feasible means of raising fiscal revenue, but the environmental case for doing so in Israel (and 
some other countries) is not strong. Whatever strategy is chosen for fuel excise, pressures to lower it when 
world oil prices are high should be resisted, as that discourages desirable demand and supply adjustments. 
In recent years the authorities have occasionally succumbed to such pressures, causing some problems for 
the treasury. There is also room to improve the relationship between diesel and gasoline taxation. In Israel the tax 
per litre of diesel is similar to that on gasoline, which is more than can be said for many OECD countries. 
This lowers demand for diesel-engine versions of private cars. However, as underscored in OECD 
calculations (for instance, OECD, 2013b), the effective tax rate in terms of energy use or carbon emissions 
is nevertheless lower than that that for gasoline. Thus, the authorities should in principle tax diesel more 
than gasoline. There is also scope to develop other use-based vehicle taxes. To date most road pricing is in the form 
of tolls on sections of road that have been built under build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts with the 
private sector and is therefore not really designed to manage traffic flows and congestion or contain local 
pollution. One exception is a reserved-lane system operating on the main highway into Tel Aviv from the 
south-east where public transport and some other vehicles (for instance, those with at least three 
passengers) can use the lane for free, while others are charged a fee (which varies according to the current 
volume of traffic). There is considerable scope to develop user charges further, for example, through more 
reserved-lane systems, an urban congestion charge or GPS-based road charging. Progress is being made on 
these fronts. In January 2013 the authorities announced the development of a reserved-lane system on 
another of the main highways into Tel Aviv. Also, the tax authority is currently conducting a feasibility 
study for an urban congestion charge. A recent OECD review of Belgian transport infrastructure 
(OECD, 2013c), which has a similarly high population density to that of Israel, illustrates the challenges 
and possibilities for policy on this front. There has been welcome reduction in the generosity of the tax treatment of company cars (typically 
provided via leasing companies) but further adjustments are needed. For companies, all expenses (leasing 
costs, maintenance and fuel) are tax deductible with no cap. As regards employees, since 2008 a use-value 
(or in-kind income) has been added to taxable income, which varies with the car's characteristics 
(including emissions) and has been substantially increased since its introduction. And, the tax treatment 
was altered further in 2010 with a switch from seven in-kind income categories to a formula calculating the 
in-kind income as a percentage of the showroom price. Data suggest there has indeed been a behavioural ECO/WKP(2014)9 15 response to these reforms. According to the Israeli tax authorities, the share of corporate sales in total car 
purchases fell from 60% in 2006 to 40% in 2012, and it is likely that the tightened legislation drove at least 
part of this trend. Nonetheless, the provision of company cars still remains common. A core problem is that 
the marginal cost to driving a company car for private purposes remains practically zero, as the associated 
recurrent expenses are often covered by the employer. Thus, the advantageous tax treatment, aside from 
implying revenue losses, is also not ideal from an environmental perspective (OECD, 2013d). According to 
the Israeli tax authorities, in the face of higher fuel costs more employers have been voluntarily 
endeavouring to limit their support by, for instance, charging employees for car use beyond a certain 
mileage. However, this should not be viewed as a substitute for further improving the tax treatment of 
company cars. As suggested in the 2011 Economic Survey, one solution is to introduce a cap on corporate 
tax deductibility for fuel expenses, the level of which could be perhaps varied to accommodate occupations 
where mileages covered for work purposes are high (such as delivery staff). The fine-tuning of vehicle taxation needs to be accompanied by improvements to alternative transport 
options. Most notably, as OECD Surveys have underscored, public transport has to be sufficiently 
developed to provide feasible alternatives to car use. Rail transport in Israel is particularly underdeveloped; 
progress in building intra-urban rail systems has been slow, and the inter-city network remains limited. 
Without further infrastructure development, ramping up vehicle taxation might fail to elicit a significant 
reduction in the number of car journeys and associated emissions, and could prompt significant opposition 
from the public. Excise duty on wholesale fuel: a potential 'universal' carbon tax Israel possesses a ready-made instrument for a carbon tax via the excise that is already charged on 
wholesale primary fuels (heavy oil, natural gas and coal). Practically all domestic GHG emissions originate 
from these fuels (which apart from natural gas are entirely imported) as they are used to generate all 
electricity and provide refined hydrocarbon fuels (such as gasoline and diesel for vehicles). Thus, the 
excise on primary fuels is, in effect, already a carbon tax. However, the excise rates remain well below the 
levels concomitant with prices of carbon that are typically assumed in policymaking, as illustrated in the 
2011 Economic Survey (OECD, 2011a, p. 113). Proposals to raise the excise to reflect environmental 
externalities were made in 2006, although they were never implemented. Ramping up the excise to reflect 
the shadow price of CO 2 would imply this particular externality is internalised throughout the supply chain. 
Thus, for instance, in the presence of such a tax it would no longer be valid to include the shadow price of 
carbon when performing an environmental account of excise on retail vehicle fuels. Similarly, justifying 
guaranteed feed-in tariffs for renewable energy production on the basis of the shadow price of CO 2 would 
no longer be appropriate. In any case feed-in tariffs are typically much higher than those suggested by the 
shadow price of CO 2 , and other arguments are used to justify them, such as a need to support demand on 
the basis that this promotes technological development that might lead to greater economic viability for 
renewables. Other issues in environmental taxation Outside the energy sector, taxation can play an important role alongside regulatory and other 
measures in ensuring environmental externalities are incorporated into household and business 
decision-making. Environmental tax reform outside the realm of energy does not tend to involve 
adjustment to established bases (where revenues can be fiscally important), but rather the introduction of 
new taxes specifically designed to deal with environmental issues. A landfill levy has been one of Israel's flagship initiatives of recent years, aiming to reflect the 
external costs of this form of waste disposal and make other forms of treatment more competitive. The levy 
varies according to the type of waste; for instance, the highest levy is imposed on the disposal of  " sludge "  ECO/WKP(2014)9 16 and the lowest on construction and demolition waste; the low rate on the latter partly reflects a widespread 
problem of illegal disposal. The proceeds are earmarked to finance waste-related developments. For 
example, they have been used to help local authorities set up municipal waste-collection points, run 
education and information systems and build recycling infrastructure. As is almost always the case with 
earmarked funding, there are no strong grounds for believing that the revenues collected will equate with 
the optimal amount of spending, and policymakers therefore need to remain aware of the risk of excessive 
or insufficient funding. The landfill levies have been increased substantially since the scheme was first introduced in 2007, 
and legislated increases are continuing for some forms of waste. Concerns about concentration in the waste 
sector have been voiced and there is the possibility that the price of processing landfill waste may be 
capped to curtail profit margins for landfill operators. This could perhaps be combined with a hike in the 
levy so as to further limit margins and preserve a gap between the cost of landfill and more 
environmentally friendly alternatives. Environmental levies also apply to water extraction, quarrying and shipping. Similar to the landfill 
levy, the latter two are linked to dedicated funds (for the restoration of quarries and marine pollution 
prevention, respectively) (OECD, 2011b). As regards air pollution some progress has also been made in 
increasing the role of economic instruments; the Clean Air Act (2008) introduced compulsory emission 
fees and permits for plants with high pollution potential. Household income tax and benefits Household income taxes and benefits account for a significant share of fiscal revenues and 
expenditures, and are an important tool of social policy. The architecture of the Israeli system is similar to 
that in many other OECD countries. Households face progressive PIT plus social-security contributions on 
the one hand, and are potentially eligible for a range of transfer programmes on the other hand, including 
unemployment benefit, general social welfare, child allowances and child support (Tables 3 and 4). In 
addition, recent years has seen the introduction of an earned income tax credit (EITC) for low-income 
households. In terms of budgeting, most welfare benefits are administered by the National Insurance 
Institute (NII), which also receives the social-security contributions directly. Shortfalls in the NII's budget 
between contributions and spending are made up by central government revenues. Therefore, the 
contributions are, for all intents and purposes, taxation in another name. Compared with other systems, 
social contributions are light, and the welfare pay-outs are not hugely generous, reflecting the parsimony in 
overall civilian public spending. Israel's light tax-benefit system in terms of spending means it is not strongly redistributive. This can 
be seen in comparing Gini coefficients for gross income and for income after adjusting for taxes and 
transfers (net income), where the country has the second-largest degree of overall income inequality in net 
terms but only the sixth largest in gross terms and is close to the United States on both counts (Figure 5). In 
terms of relative poverty, the pre-tax rate is similarly close to that of the United States, but the post-tax 
incidence of relative poverty is substantially higher and indeed is the highest in the OECD area (Figure 6), 
echoing the low spending on social welfare. The bottom line is that any substantial reduction in Israel's 
rate of relative poverty is likely to involve more public spending. ECO/WKP(2014)9 17 Table 3. Personal income tax and social security contributions Dimension 
Notable features Scope of the tax base 
Levied on an individual basis. Income from employment, some welfare benefits and 
pensions as well as interest income are included in the base. Rates and thresholds As of January 2014, six rates ranging from 11% to 50%, the first threshold is at 
NIS 62 400 and the last at NIS 501 960. In addition, a 2%  " surtax "  applies to annual 
incomes above NIS 800 000. 
Tax on interest is subject to a ceiling of 25% (i.e. individuals pay their marginal rate of tax 
on interest income, but only up to a rate of 25%). The ceiling is 15% for interest on non-
indexed shekel deposits, and rules differ if the interest is accrued by a  " substantial owner "  
of an asset. Thresholds automatically updated to compensate for inflation every year (except for a few 
years when the threshold update has been cancelled as a one-off fiscal measure). Wasteable tax credits Credit points system with a universal component and an additional credit per-child (for 
fathers the credit applies only for children up to the age of three, unless they are a lone 
parent). Women also receive an additional tax allowance. The credits mean that large 
numbers of earners, particularly women with children, do not pay any personal income 
tax. Earned-income tax 
credit (EITC) (non-
wasteable) Applies to households with one or more children and those aged 55 and over. Maximum 
monthly credit NIS 330 for those with one or two children (NIS 495 for mothers and single 
fathers) and NIS 480 for those with three of more children (NIS 720 for mothers and 
single fathers). National insurance: 
standard rates Up to 60% of the average wage: employee contribution 3.5%, employer contribution 
3.45%. Above 60% of the average wage: employee contribution 12%, employer contribution 
6.5% (the latter is due to increase to 7.5% in 2014). Special conditions 
Special contribution rates apply to non-working persons: the unemployed, disabled 
pensioners and so on. Other considerations

Notable features Unemployment 
insurance benefit Pay-out ranges from 45 to 80% of previous earnings (35 to 60% for those 
aged under 28), accompanied by benefit ceilings. Maximum duration ranges 
from 50 to 175 days according to age and number of dependents. 
Subject to regular income tax, but a low National Insurance Institute (NII) 
contribution rate is applied. 
Those taking up  " unsuitable work "  can receive UI as an in-work benefit. Income support 
Eligibility is means and employment tested. Ownership of a car no longer 
precludes eligibility, but vehicles are included in the assessment of assets. 
For instance, monthly support is NIS 2 843 for a couple with two or more 
children. 
Support increases with household size, but not beyond two children. 
Support can be given when the family has income from other sources 
(including earnings). There are modest earnings disregards. For earnings 
above these levels, benefits are withdrawn at rates ranging from 62.5 to 70%. Paid maternity leave 
and birth grants Conditional on NII contributions for 10 of the last 14 months (or 15 out of 
preceding 22) preceding due date. Those on Income Support would normally 
be eligible for hospitalisation grants as they pay a health-care contribution. 
A maternity allowance pays 100% of previous earnings for up to 14 weeks. 
In addition, there are one-off birth grants, which decline with the number of 
children, hospitalisation grants and benefit for precautionary rest taken during 
pregnancy. 
Leave (and payment) can be switched to the father for up to six weeks. Universal child 
allowances More generous allowances can apply to children born before May 2003, 
depending on birth order. Monthly allowances were cut in the 
2013-14 budget. 
Those on Income Support receive additional allowances equal to 70% of 
regular child benefit for both the third and fourth children. 
The allowances are paid until the child reaches age 18. Study grants 
Eligible groups notably include lone parents and families on Income Support 
with at least four children. 
Annual payments of NIS 1 528 per child aged 6 to 12 and NIS 849 per child 
aged 12 to 14. Rental support

direction that Israel's policymakers would probably not have made, were it not for the fiscal difficulties 
and the political pressures from the tent protests. The planned cuts in PIT, as well as those in CIT, reflected 
a belief that these generate sizeable positive second-round effects in terms of investment and growth. As 
OECD Surveys have argued, lowering top-end PIT rates probably delivered healthy marginal returns 
initially in terms of attracting investment and incentivising labour, but these diminished over time with the 
immediate fiscal consequences of cutting tax rates becoming progressively more prominent. While the cancellation of the rate cuts was, on balance, a good move from a fiscal point of view, the 
subsequent increases do pose risks for the country's reputation regarding the business friendliness of the 
tax environment. There have now been three rounds of PIT rate increases: the Trajtenberg reform saw an 0.04

freeze on threshold updating, plus a 2% surtax on very high incomes (Table 1); and finally, all PIT rates

statutory rate (including social-security contributions) is now quite high in international comparison at 52%

personal income tax and so does not add to the marginal tax rate on earnings in this bracket). This said, the 
income threshold of the top rate of tax (in relation to the average wage) is good deal greater than in many 
countries with high top marginal rates, such as Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Finland (Figure 7). The 
recent increases in all PIT rates imply Israel's position in international comparison has become slightly less 
flattering across a wide range of skill levels. Figure 7. Top marginal rates of personal income tax and corresponding thresholds¹ 2012 1.

with the generosity, accessibility and qualifying conditions of welfare benefits, govern poorer households' 
disposable incomes and influence their incentives to engage in the labour market. Ensuring that the system 
of taxes and transfers is well designed is particularly important for Israel, given the large number of poor 
households concentrated in the rapidly growing Haredi community and in the Arab-Israeli sector. The issue 
is regularly assessed, for instance in the National Insurance Institute's Annual Surveys and the Bank of 
Israel's Annual Reports and has been discussed in several OECD reports (the latest being a follow-up 
review on social policy: OECD, 2013e). Of course the tax-benefit system is not the only area requiring

instance, increasing the number of labour inspectors. Over the past few years the tax wedge on labour has shifted away from being among the very lowest 
in the OECD distribution, although this is not due to the tax-benefit system per se. Indeed, personal income 
tax and total social security contributions on low-wage earners remain very light. Tax credits plus a low 
bottom rate of tax (for 2013 the rate is 10% for the first NIS 63 360) mean that individuals earning up to 
the average wage (approximately NIS 110 000) pay little or no income tax. Social security contributions 
are also modest; the combined employee and employer contribution rate is only 6.95% up to 60% of the 
average wage and 18.5% on earnings above this amount. Thus, the aggregate tax wedge based on standard 
taxation and social contributions is among the least burdensome in the OECD. Even with the imminent 
increases in tax rates, this wedge will still be low. However, mandatory pension contributions to 
private-sector pension funds ( " second pillar "  pensions) were introduced in 2008 with contribution rates 
increasing annually according to a schedule that ends in 2014 (when the total contribution will reach 
17.5%). OECD simulations show that as of 2012 the tax wedge for a single person earning two-thirds of 
the average wage with no children was only 13% of total labour costs, but 23% once the second-pillar 
pension contribution is included (the  " compulsory payment wedge " , Figure 8). Moreover, the latter figure 
is estimated to reach 27% in 2014 due to the further increase in mandated pension contributions. True, the 
pension-contribution component of the wedge probably elicits milder behavioural responses than the 
taxation component, to the extent that individuals view it as a redistribution of their own income over time. 
Also, a tax wedge of this magnitude is still well short of the largest in the OECD area. Nevertheless the 
negative effects of further increases on the demand for and supply of labour and more generally the 
business environment should be a consideration in assessing the pros and cons of further recourse to PIT or 
social contributions as a means of raising revenues. Figure 8. Tax and compulsory payment wedges for a single person at two-thirds average wage, no children 2012 Note: "ISR2014" incorporates the higher mandatory pension contribution that will apply in 2014, while leaving other settings used for 
the calculation at the 2012 values. Source: OECD, Taxing wages database. In other respects the tax-benefit system has some positive qualities in terms of work incentives. 
Unemployment insurance benefit duration is not excessive, ranging from 1½ to 6 months, depending on 
the applicant's age and family circumstances. Also, the main welfare benefit – Income Support Benefit – is 
not only means tested but also requires an employment test (OECD, 2010). As shown in Figure 9, among 
the various standard household types modelled by the OECD, the replacement rates in the first month of

The micro simulations normally cover only benefits for which there is a general entitlement. For both Italy and Greece, where no 
broad social-assistance programmes exist, the simulations indicate that benefits are zero for some types of household at the 
60th month of unemployment. Hence the minimum OECD replacement rates are zero in some cases. However, in Italy and 
Greece, and possibly in other countries, local authorities or sub-national governments may provide some form of cash support 
on a case-by-case discretionary basis. Source: OECD, tax-benefit models; see www.oecd.org/els/social/workincentives. The fact that a significant proportion of Israel's poor households are very large affects the policy 
issues and complicates any assessment of the tax-benefit system. First, the universal child allowances often 
account for a significant share of income for large households and, consequently, are often at the forefront 
of debate about welfare benefits. The Haredi community's interest in maintaining generous child 
allowances has, at least in the past, been intense and often influential. Not only are their families typically 
large, but the Income Support Benefit is of limited relevance because most Haredi men study full time and 
are thus ineligible based on the benefit's employment test. Large cuts were made to the child allowances in 
the early 2000s, but this was followed by some programmed increases. However, the governing coalition 
has reduced child allowances and moved away from universal provision: they were eliminated for those 
with incomes of more than NIS 800 000 per year (i.e. around USD 225 000 or seven times the average 
wage). Abandoning universality is justifiable in terms of spending efficiency in a difficult fiscal situation, 
but with such a high threshold the savings will likely prove small. The reform to the value of the child 
allowances is of some concern. The allowance has been cut to NIS 140 per month for each child, 
previously it was either NIS 175 or NIS 263 (the latter applying to the second, third and fourth child) the 
higher benefits were granted to children born before 2003. The cut in the allowance in itself implies 
significant percentage reductions in the incomes of poor families with many children. However, the cut has 
been made alongside a raft of measures providing positive encouragements to labour force participation 
and skills development, such as the widening of free childcare, plans to revive private-sector job placement 
and the increase in the value of the earned-income tax credit (EITC). The presence of a significant number of large families has also to be borne in mind in considering the 
extent and significance of poverty and the capacity of the tax-benefit system to bring these households 
above the standard poverty thresholds. Relative poverty thresholds are commonly calculated as half of 
 " standardised "  median income (the poverty rate is then the share of households below the threshold). The 0 20 40 60 80 100 120

Israel ECO/WKP(2014)9 24 standardisation procedure divides household income by an adjusted figure that gives progressively less 
weight to each additional family member (conceptually this is intended to reflect economies of scale as 
households increase in size). OECD relative poverty statistics, for example, use a standardisation weight 
based on the square root of family size, i.e. the marginal weights for each family member are 1, 0.41, 0.32, 
0.27, etc. (Israel's National Insurance Institute uses a different weighting system in which the marginal 
weights are typically higher). One practical implication is that, for instance, the poverty threshold for a 
couple with six children is 41% higher than that of one with two children under the OECD's square root 
approach; keeping large households above the poverty line implies a need for generous welfare provisions. There is a need to press ahead more vigorously on some fronts, the EITC in particular. The EITC is 
available to workers with children and/or those aged 55 or over and is a non-wasteable credit: in other 
words, households can receive a payment from the tax authorities if the credit exceeds the value of tax 
otherwise owed. In its pilot phase the credit was twinned with a programme introducing government-
funded private-sector placement services, which was later cancelled. The EITC has operated nation-wide 
since 2011 and the credit for mothers and single fathers was increased by 50% in 2012. During the pilot 
phase (between 2007 and 2010) the scheme is estimated to have boosted recipients' annual income by 7% 
and to have reduced their incidence of poverty by about 4.5% (Bank of Israel, 2013). Its subsequent 
extension to the whole country plus the increases in credit amounts will have boosted its impact, but its 
scale remains small. Further increases in the take-up, and possible also the generosity, of the credit are 
required to have an appreciable impact on in-work poverty and incentives to enter the labour force (or to 
increase hours worked among those already employed). Public spending on the credit was only 0.02% of 
GDP in 2011. This figure will have increased since then due to increased take-up and hikes in the credit 
but probably not to the level spent on similar schemes for instance in the United States and 
United Kingdom where the credit costs 0.4 to 0.5% of GDP. Little progress has been made in reforming the disability benefit system, with disappointing take-up of 
a new scheme aiming to encourage employment. As in a number of other OECD countries there are 
concerns that there are fairly significant numbers of disability-benefit recipients who have some capacity to 
work, but that the system neither encourages nor makes it easy for them to so. Gauged by the total number 
of recipients, the problem in Israel has not swelled to the levels seen in some countries but nevertheless 
needs to be tackled. To their credit the authorities have at least been trying to bring about concrete change. 
Reforms in 2009, inter alia, brought a new classification of disability-benefit recipients and the 
introduction of an earnings top-up payment (the Incentive to Work benefit) as an alternative to regular 
disability benefit. The Incentive to Work Benefit includes guarantees permitting a return to full-time 
disability benefit (if, for instance, the individual decides to quit their job) and is, in principle, financially 
attractive. However, take-up has been extremely low – only 3 490 people entered the scheme in 2011 out 
of the approximately 215 000 persons on disability pensions. Seemingly, mistrust of the guarantees 
attached to the scheme and complicated procedures are key reasons for low take-up (OECD, 2013e). Such 
efforts to engage with those already on disability benefits should not be abandoned. Also, there should be a 
focus on new claimants, where reforms are often easier to implement and more effective, and on policies 
encouraging employers' demand for disabled workers. In that vein, new support centres to advise and 
assist employers with disabled workers are planned. In addition, tax-benefit policy needs to focus more tightly on the core socio-economic problem: that 
of poor and often large households with weak labour-force attachment. Since the tent protests of 2011, 
middle-class concerns have gained in prominence, and there is a risk that these overly divert policy 
attention and resources away from solving the problems of poverty and wide socio-economic divides. In 
the Israeli context some measures might, prima facie, help both low-and middle-income households but in 
reality largely benefit the latter (and possibly high-income households too). In particular, reductions in 
income-tax rates or social-security contributions, as well as expanding wasteable tax credits, are unlikely to 
relieve poverty or raise work incentives among poor households to any great degree, because a significant ECO/WKP(2014)9 25 proportion already pay little or no income tax, whether working or not. For example, the decision to allow 
men to claim child allowance when children are aged up to three years was a good move towards equal 
treatment (though the treatment remains asymmetric as for mothers the allowance applies to older children 
too), but also fiscally costly and largely benefiting middle-and upper-income households. Accompanying 
the extension of the allowance with a reduction in its size would arguably have been a better move. Of course, adjustments to taxes and benefits are only one element in the range of possible policies to 
tackle socio-economic problems. For instance, the government is committed to widening access to free 
daycare for infants and to early childhood education, which should help households combine work and 
family life. And, with a view to providing longer-term improvement in living standards for poorer 
communities, policymakers are endeavouring to improve education for Arab-Israeli students and to 
encourage Haredi schools to pay more attention to core subjects, such as maths and languages. Pension reform Israel's pension system combines a modest publicly funded pay-as-you go pension (the first pillar of 
the system) with favourable tax treatment of pension savings and pay-outs. As mentioned above, since 
2008 for (almost all) employees there are minimum compulsory contribution rates to private-sector pension 
plans (the system's second pillar, see Table 5). Thus, in broad terms, the authorities have avoided 
significant fiscal commitment. This, combined with favourable demographics, means that public spending 
on pensions has remained relatively low. And, even though population ageing will increase spending in the 
future, public pension spending under current policy settings will remain among the lowest in the OECD 
area. The first pillar of the pension system ensures reasonably adequate support for retirees when 
benchmarked against standard poverty thresholds. However, this is not entirely thanks to the state pension. 
Indeed, as calculations for the 2010 Economic Survey show (p. 128), even with the inclusion of seniority 
payments (Table 5), pension income per se probably falls somewhat short of the poverty threshold for 
many retiree households. However, retirees can be eligible for top-up payments referred to as the Income 
Supplement (similar to the Income Support benefit discussed above), and calculations suggest these 
typically ensure retiree incomes are above poverty thresholds (though not by much). However, the first-pillar pension is not devoid of problems, most notably a singular failure to reach 
political agreement to bring women's eligibility age for the state pension up to men's. Commendably the 
retirement age for men has already been increased to 67 years (this was achieved in 2009). However, 
increases in women's retirement age have stalled, remaining at 62 since 2009, and a series of increases that 
would bring it to 64 is due to start only in 2017. Among OECD countries it is now extremely rare for 
women's retirement age to be below that of men and where this is the case for there to be no concrete plans 
to close that gap. While the second pillar of the pension system does not involve direct state funding, there are implications 
for taxes and benefits and related issues. As pointed out above, the introduction of compulsory pension 
saving involving both employee and employer contributions in 2008 is similar in some respects to a hike in 
the tax wedge on labour as regards employees' and employers' incentives. Israel's tax treatment of pension 
saving (or similar forms of saving) comprises partial exemption at the contribution phase, full exemption in 
the accumulation phase, and imposition of PIT (though with some special breaks) at the pay-out phase 
(so-called EET tax treatment). Previous OECD assessment (most recently in OECD, 2013e) has suggested 
the tax treatment should be reviewed. One issue is that introduction of the mandatory pension contributions 
was not accompanied by a revision to tax treatment, with tax relief continuing to apply to the compulsory 
component which is in a sense wasteful tax expenditure. Also, the tax benefit on pension income is in the ECO/WKP(2014)9 26 Table 5. Key features of the pension system First pillar (state pension and related benefits) Retirement age 
Men's retirement age reached 67 years in 2009. For women the retirement age is currently 
62 years; a schedule bringing it to 64 years is due to begin in 2017. There are limits on 
earnings while in receipt of a public pension up to age 70 for men and age 67 for women 
(this is being increased to age 70). Contributions 
Total mandatory employee and employer contributions to the NII have several components, 
including one for pensions. The NII's accounts are fungible in this regard, and the amount of 
contribution has no bearing on the pension pay-out. Coverage 
Practically universal. Exceptions include immigrants who arrived when over the age of 60 
who are covered by a special arrangement. Pay-out 
Pay-outs vary according to household composition and age. For example, as of 
January 2013 for those under 80 years old the pension for a single person was NIS 1 502 
per month and for a couple NIS 2 257 (the pensions are slightly higher for those over 80). A seniority increment increases the pension by 2% for each year of full contributions after 
the first 10 years of contributions (with a ceiling on the total increment of 50% of the 
pension). Thus, for instance, including the maximum possible increment, the total pension 
for a single person (aged under 80) is NIS 2 253 and for a couple NIS 3 386. The  " survivors "  pension pay-out is similar that of the regular pension. Income 
Supplement The income-support system guarantees minimum income levels subject to means testing. 
As of 2013, for example, single persons aged 70 to 80 are guaranteed NIS 2 833 and 
couples NIS 4 204. Deductions 
A deduction for medical insurance is made on the basic pension (which is lower if the 
individual is eligible for the Income Supplement). Second and third pillars (compulsory or voluntary contributions to pension funds or similar) Contributions 
Mandatory minimum contributions to the new pension funds (introduced in 2008) apply to 
employees' earnings up to the average gross wage. The contribution rate has been 
undergoing stepped increases and will reach 17.5% (7.5% from employees and 10% from 
employers) by 2014. Five percentage points of the employers' contribution also serves as 
severance insurance. Tax treatment 
Tax treatment not only applies to  " regular "  pension products but also to saving via 
life-insurance and provident-fund products. Employer contributions are not counted in employees' taxable income (with a ceiling). Employee contributions are subject to a 35% (wasteable) tax credit (with a ceiling). Returns on pension saving are not taxed. Pay-outs (annuities) are taxed according to regular income-tax rules except there is: a) a tax 
credit of 35% on the annuity (with a ceiling equal to about 30% of the average wage); and, 
b) an additional tax credit if one's spouse does not work and has no pension. Other dimensions Tax incentives generally guide the retirement age (or equivalent) set in long-term saving 
products. But there are some regulations too. For example, provident-fund savings can be 
withdrawn only at age 60 or above. Defined-contribution pensions include insurance for severance pay, withdrawal of which 
affects the pension pay-out. Pensioners must redeem their pension on a monthly annuitised basis (and not, for example, 
make capital withdrawals), unless the person already has a monthly income of at least 
NIS 4 000 (i.e. about 60% of the average wage). There are portability provisions for switching between savings products (introduced in 2008). form of a universal tax credit and is therefore not hugely efficient as a means of combatting pension 
poverty. A further issue is that the returns to the mandated pension saving for low-income households are 
dented, since the income from second-pillar pensions can mean reduced income-support payments as ECO/WKP(2014)9 27 pension income is counted in the means test. Adjustments aiming to further encourage pension saving are 
being planned alongside proposals to introduce default portfolios in which investment risk declines as the 
employee ages (the so-called life-cycle approach). Parenthetically, scrapping the tax credit for medium-term saving in so-called  " advanced training 
funds "  (Kranot Hishtalmut) was for a while included in proposed measures for the 2013-14 budget, but 
unfortunately did not make the final budget. The funds have to be held for three years if the savings are 
spent on training or education but if held for at least six years they can be spent on a wide range of goods 
and services, for instance the purchase of cars. As OECD Surveys have pointed out there is practically no 
economic justification for maintaining this particular tax expenditure. Property and capital gains taxation Israel is one of several OECD countries that have no taxes on the value of property in the form of 
wealth tax or on transfers of property through inheritance or gift taxes. Interest income, dividends and 
capital gains are subject to various flat rates of tax. The basic rate of capital gains tax is the same as that for 
corporate income tax, but there are variations depending on the purchase date and the nature of the asset. 
And, as in most other OECD countries, the tax treatment of housing (and real estate in general) differs 
from that on other assets, which has an important influence on rates of home ownership and property 
markets and therefore the focus of this section. Taxation relating to housing In a welcome move the 2013-14 budget pruned exemptions on capital gains from the sale of property. 
The in-depth review of the housing sector in the 2011 OECD Survey was critical of the scope of these 
exemptions, and the budget law has narrowed them considerably: exemptions on capital gains from second 
homes or investment properties have been scrapped entirely (previously there was exemption as long as the 
owner held onto the property for a minimum number of years); and a limit has been placed on the 
exemption from capital gains tax for principal residences. In other respects the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing takes a practical approach. In theory, 
owner-occupiers should be taxed on imputed rental income but allowed to deduct mortgage interest 
payments. However, due to the practical difficulties of establishing imputed rents, the treatment is similar 
to that in some other countries: neither imputed rents nor mortgage interest are taken into account (the 
assumption being that their values are roughly equivalent, although this is not the case once the mortgage 
is paid off). More serious is that up to certain limits private taxpayers renting out properties do not have to 
declare rental income. In addition, the authorities should consider raising the Land Betterment Tax (Hetel 
Hashbacha), which is imposed when the property sold has benefitted from favourable re-zoning; the tax is 
currently 20% of the estimated value of the betterment accrued. Such a move would improve the state's 
share in the windfall profits from re-zoning and reduce the incentives for property developers to try to 
influence local planning decisions. Transaction costs on purchasing a house have become somewhat heavier: the tax has been increased 
when purchasing investment property or second homes, and a supplementary tax has been introduced for 
high-end property. Given the very wide search for additional revenues in the 2013-14 budget and the 
continued concerns about the strength of house-price rises, these moves are understandable. Although these 
particular measures are very unlikely to have dissuaded household mobility to any great extent, the 
authorities should remain aware of this issue should further hikes in transactions taxes be considered. Also, 
as a measure to cool the property market, the government has been considering a penalty tax on property 
developers if the time between receiving the approval for construction and the sale of all properties in the 
project exceeds three years. ECO/WKP(2014)9 28 Revenues from recurrent taxes on immovable property (i.e. housing or other buildings) are among the 
highest in the OECD area (Figure 10, Panel B), representing about 2.25% of GDP and account for the 
majority of property tax (including that on financial assets) (Figure 10, Panel A). Israeli property tax (the 
Arnona) is based on the surface area and type of property and is a significant source of municipal revenues. 
The exploitation of the tax base on immovable property is broadly welcome, given its textbook advantages, 
in particular the low risk of evasion and less distortionary effects on economic behaviour compared with 
other tax bases. Figure 10. Tax on property As a percentage of GDP 1.

This sub-heading covers taxes levied regularly in respect of the use or ownership of immovable property. These taxes are 
levied on land and buildings. Source: OECD tax revenue database and OECD Economic Outlook 94 database. New regulations are in train that, if fully implemented, will double the Arnona on vacant apartments. 
The move is part of wider efforts to increase the supply of housing; in this instance the intention is to 
dissuade property owners from leaving apartments vacant for prolonged periods, which is quite common in 
some localities, especially Jerusalem, where there are substantial numbers of foreign property owners. 
According to the regulation, municipalities will use water-meter data to determine whether the apartments 
are 'vacant' and therefore subject to the higher Arnona rate. While this move is perhaps well intentioned, 
prima facie it seems possible that the absent owners may find an easy way around regulation by arranging 
for someone to occasionally run the water for them or by just leaving the tap on a little. Also, those who 
are content with leaving apartments unrented are probably not that price sensitive and so the extra levy 
may not substantially reduce the number of so-called  " ghost apartments " , although then it would be an 
efficient revenue-raising base. Company taxes and business subsidies Israeli policy on corporate tax and business subsidies appears to be guided by several objectives: 
i) making the profile of taxes and subsidies attractive to investors, especially foreign investors; 
ii) encouraging scientific R&D and other forms of innovation; iii) promoting regional development; and, 
iv) providing targeted support for the agricultural sector. Any one element of tax or subsidy often reflects 
more than one of these goals. Various factors shape how far each is pursued, most notably the strength of 
revenue pressures and the balance of tax burdens between households and firms. The latter not only 1995

OECD maximum ECO/WKP(2014)9 29 reflecting subjective societal choices but also practical considerations, such as co-ordinating policy on the 
statutory CIT rate with that on PIT to prevent tax avoidance through incorporation by high earners. Making the profile of taxes more attractive for business In small open economies such as Israel's the tension between keeping business tax light in the 
interests of investment while accommodating revenue needs and tax-fairness considerations is particularly 
acute because of their intense exposure to capital mobility. As elsewhere, corporate-income taxation 
involves a range of tax breaks (and subsidies), many of which are, in effect, differentiating between 
different degrees of capital mobility, thus helping ease policy tensions by targeting special treatment only 
where it is most required to attract investment. However, the tools for achieving that differentiation are not 
that precise and can result in a complex system that can be hard to communicate and entail high 
administrative costs. As an alternative, some OECD countries have focused on imposing a low statutory 
CIT rate with few base-narrowing rules, tax breaks or subsidies. Until 2011 Israeli policy was also heading towards a low statutory CIT rate. It had been on a 
downward track for some years and by 2011 had reached 24%, with further cuts programmed that would 
have brought it to 18% in 2016. As mentioned, revenue concerns and political opposition arising from the 
tent protests saw the schedules of cuts abandoned and followed by an increase from 24 to 25% in 2012, 
with an increase to 26.5% scheduled for January 2014. At that point the rate will probably be once again 
slightly above the (unweighted) OECD average (Figure 11). Figure 11. Statutory rates of corporate income tax Per cent 1.

The shaded area is the 25th to 75th percentile range of available OECD countries. Source: OECD tax database. The negative impact of these developments on the perceived 'competitiveness' of the tax system has 
probably not been very large so far. The headline rate has not been increased substantially, and, in any 
case, the attractiveness of the system also depends on the various factors in calculating the CIT base, as 
well as tax breaks and subsidy programmes. The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments 
(LECI), the flagship programme on this front, offers CIT rates well below the statutory rate plus other 
support (Table 6). Previously this legislation explicitly focused on attracting foreign investment; in its 
current version the eligibility rules assess the firm's export orientation (whether foreign-owned or 
domestic), a key criterion being that export revenues must account for at least one quarter of turnover. 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014

macroeconomic policy. Given that the change in Israeli policy on the statutory rate reflects efforts to bring 
fiscal balances back on track, the investment community has probably taken a less dim view of it than 
might otherwise have been the case. Strong revenue pressures and greater public attention to the distribution of the tax burden between 
corporations and households have increased the challenges in presenting a business-friendly tax profile. 
Looking ahead: @BULLET Further hikes in the CIT rate beyond 2014 could be damaging. Even if the direct impact may not 
be significant, further rises may create the impression that the rate is on an upward trend and 
prompt fears that economic policy in general is becoming less business-friendly. Rate cuts should 
certainly not be dismissed entirely from the policy agenda, even though it may be some time 
before fiscal conditions (and perhaps the political climate too) allow them to resume. @BULLET There may be avenues for improving the efficiency of some CIT features. For example, the 
LECI's international competitiveness eligibility rule mentioned above could perhaps be raised so 
as to provide savings and better focus the preferential rates on businesses that are heavily 
exposed to international competition. @BULLET There may also be opportunities to develop taxation more fully where activities are inherently 
tied to location, in particular resource extraction. The authorities have already demonstrated a 
capacity for reform in this area with the new tax-royalty regime for natural gas and oil resources 
in 2011 (Box 1). Also as from 2011, businesses engaged in natural resource extraction have been 
precluded from the benefits under the LECI. And, 2013 saw the launch of a committee to re-
examine tax-royalty regimes for natural resources outside the sphere of natural gas and oil 
(dubbed the Sheshinski II Committee, after its chair). @BULLET International comparison suggests there is room to reduce tax compliance costs for business. 
According to the World Bank's Doing Business database Israeli businesses have to deal with a 
comparatively large number of separate payments; 33 in total. According to the Israeli authorities 
27 of these tax payments can be made online. However, the World Bank data suggest taxpayers 
are nevertheless devoting a considerable number of hours to making these payments (235 hours, 
on average). In contrast, for example, for Ireland eight payments are reported with an average 
time to comply of 80 hours (see later sections). Recognising the need for further progress, the 
authorities aim for only 17 separate payments by end-2015, and ministries have been required to 
make proposals for cutting red tape in the interface between government and business. Box 1. The 2011 reform of the tax-royalty regime for natural gas and oil resources The discovery of substantial offshore hydrocarbon resources (mainly in the form of natural gas) prompted positive 
reform of the tax-royalty regime in 2011 and commitment to establishing a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). The reform 
left the royalty rate itself unchanged but made numerous adjustments and added new features to taxation 
(OECD, 2011a). In particular, a special profit levy is now imposed once the ratio of accumulated revenues over costs 
of a particular gas (and/or oil) field reach a certain level (the levy is often referred to as the Sheshinski tax after the 
person who headed the committee established to recommend reforms to the regime). The plan is to channel the 
Sheshinski tax revenues, which will not become substantial for some years hence, into an SWF. Preparations for this 
are well advanced; as of September 2013 the legislation had completed the parliamentary process. The establishment 
of the fund reflects a welcome effort to ring-fence the public's share of the hydrocarbon resources and spread the 
returns across generations through a drawdown mechanism. The fund will also be designed to reduce the risk of 
so-called  " Dutch disease "  by skewing the fund's portfolio towards foreign-currency assets (the authorities have already 
started combating Dutch-disease effects with the Bank of Israel's foreign-currency purchase mechanism). ECO/WKP(2014)9 32 Encouraging innovation As elsewhere, R&D activity and innovation in general are encouraged through favourable tax 
treatment and a host of targeted programmes providing grants and other forms of support. Economic 
justification for favouring innovative activity lies in externalities arising from gaps between public and 
private returns to innovation and knowledge spillovers. However, while there is little doubt as to the 
existence of such phenomena, their scale is uncertain, and the underlying processes generating them are 
complex. Therefore, developing effective support programmes (either in the form of tax exemptions or 
grants) requires good systems for monitoring and assessing programme impact and low policymaking 
inertia when it comes to dropping poorly performing schemes or ramping up those that prove successful. R&D support programmes in Israel are managed by the Office of the Chief Scientist, which is 
supervised by the Ministry of Economics and Trade. The main programme comprises a system of 
competitively awarded grants. Its design is interesting in that, if the supported R&D project generates 
commercial revenues, then recipients must repay the grant via a deduction comprising a small percentage 
of annual sales. These repayments are an important source of revenues for the Office and therefore the 
system is more akin to high-risk loans than a pure 'grant' programme. A number of additional programmes provide tailored support for small-scale start-ups, academic 
research (especially when in conjunction with business) and co-operation between domestic and foreign 
multinationals (Table 6). Also, subsidy schemes endeavour to attract companies to base scientific R&D 
centres and R&D in the finance sector in Israel. There is support for business parks for start-ups (so-called 
business incubators) as well. A large number of state-owned incubators were established in the 1990s, the 
vast majority of which were subsequently privatised (of the 24 currently operating only two remain in state 
hands). Government continues to play a significant role, as it partially funds the financial (and other) 
support provided to the entrepreneurs taken on by the incubators. Given the Israeli economy's impressive scoring on indicators of R&D and high-tech activity (for 
instance, OECD, 2012b), questions naturally arise regarding policy lessons for other countries on R&D tax 
breaks and subsidies. At face value the menu of support on offer in Israel does not differ radically from 
elsewhere, but there may be important differences in detail. Also, there are other forces at work. Training 
with sophisticated technologies during military service, a large pool of researchers in the Jewish diaspora, 
and the engineering and science skills brought by the mass immigration from the former Soviet Union in 
the early 1990s are commonly cited as the key drivers of the economy's success on this front. Digging 
deeper into this issue requires an in-depth examination of Israel's innovation performance and policy. Regional development Israel's tax-subsidy system has fairly strong elements of regional development in that some support is 
either available, or is more generous, only in certain areas of the country (or specific towns). The 
preferential CIT rates provided by the LECI, for instance, are lower in certain regions. And, there is a 
system of employment grants that is available only in some places. As for the other regional incentives 
(such as those provided for housing), there are some sound socio-economic arguments to justify them; for 
instance, promoting the development of poor peripheral areas and as a means of combatting the 
externalities of urban congestion in the centre of the country. However, this is almost certainly not the sole 
motivation for such regional incentives, given Israel's geopolitical situation. Support for the agriculture sector As mentioned in the context of customs duties above, support for the agricultural sector is significant: 
as of 2012 producer support was estimated at 12% of farm receipts (OECD, 2013a). In addition to the ECO/WKP(2014)9 33 tariff-based border protection, agriculture is supported through a number of other channels including: 
implicit subsidies through low rents of state-owned land (almost all land is state-owned), favourable 
charges for water compared to other users, guaranteed prices and sales volumes for producers, direct 
income support, capital grants and subsidised insurance schemes. Such heavy support brings higher 
consumer prices, imposes additional fiscal burdens, curbs structural adjustment toward higher-productivity 
sectors and implies spillovers on foreign trading partners, especially poor countries with plentiful arable 
land. As detailed in a recent OECD assessment (OECD, 2013a), reform initiatives have typically headed in 
the right direction (i.e. lowering support), but implementation is frequently slow. For example, reductions 
in the guaranteed price paid to dairy farmers for raw milk along the lines recommended by the Kedmi 
Committee in 2012 have yet to be implemented. A need for more integrated assessment of targeted business support Viewed as a whole, Israel's corporate tax and business support is generous, particularly to 
internationally competitive, high tech operations. The principle of support can only be welcomed, 
particularly that aiming to overcome informational barriers and asymmetries between private and public 
returns in innovation. However, it is also important to recognise that, especially when stacked together, tax 
breaks and other forms of support can be overly generous, subsidising much non-incremental activity. The 
preceding paragraphs suggest this could be the case for Israel. For instance, it seems possible that some 
firms can simultaneously benefit from the LECI, the R&D fund and employment subsidies and probably 
enjoy a hefty net subsidy as a result. In light of this, the recent establishment of an inter-ministerial 
committee to examine the costs and benefits of business subsidies is certainly welcome. Evasion, avoidance and administration issues If additional revenues can be raised via enhanced compliance, for instance through more effectively 
tackling tax evasion and aggressive avoidance, this would create room for manoeuvre in tax strategy and 
help fiscal balances in general. The increased attention, both domestically and world-wide, to tax evasion 
and avoidance is providing a political opportunity for renewed policy vigour on this front. As in other countries the attention of policymakers, the press and the public has homed in on the 
seemingly low levels of tax paid by some well-known business operations. Particular attention is often 
drawn to companies' 'tax optimisation' strategies that erode the corporate tax base by shifting profits 
between tax jurisdictions (base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS), which has become a focus of OECD 
analysis (OECD, 2013f). Governments, including Israel's, wish to create attractive environments for 
business on their own terms, through targeted tax incentives and subsidy programmes such as those 
described above, not through companies exploiting unintended loopholes. BEPS may not only imply losses 
in CIT revenue but also put multinational enterprises (MNEs) in an advantageous position over domestic 
firms and distort investment. Also, the perceived unfairness of BEPS risks damaging trust and compliance 
elsewhere in the tax system. However, making progress in addressing these issues can be tough, especially 
when this runs counter to MNEs' vested interests. Recent experience in the taxation of profits (or 
dividends) when transferred out of the country illustrates that resolving these issues is often a bargaining 
outcome, rather than one driven only by economic principles (Box 2). This underscores the importance of 
Israeli policymakers working together with other governments on the BEPS Action Plan to achieve 
international consensus on actions to deal with weaknesses in the international tax system. ECO/WKP(2014)9 34 Box 2. The issue of "trapped profits" Big business often has a degree of bargaining power regarding tax treatment, and Israel is no exception. This 
has been exemplified by the issue of so-called 'trapped profits', which has become prominent. In a previous version of 
the LECI foreign transfer of dividends or profits was subject to capital taxation. As a result, some large companies held 
back from such transfers, accumulating large reserves of assets in Israel. A new version of the law, which came into 
force in 2011, removed this condition, but not retrospectively. The regime for  " trapped profits "  was offered to 
companies as a non-obligatory complementary measure following the transition from the former version to the current 
LECI. Following consultation with business, an amendment to the LECI was passed in November 2012 under which 
companies that accumulated profits under the former version of the LECI will pay between 40 and 70% of what would 
have been owed under the previous rules when transferring dividends or profits. This non-obligatory measure 
stipulates that the amount of saved tax in increasing the plant in Israel by purchasing more machinery and equipment, 
R&D expenditures or hiring new employees. According to press reports, as of November 2013 the amendment had 
brought NIS 4.4 billion in revenues. The authorities' efforts to tackle the 'trapped profits' issue is part of a wider campaign to increase 
revenues and to tackle evasion and aggressive avoidance. Concrete steps on several fronts have being taken 
or are underway, including: media campaigns, increased numbers of staff (an additional 400 relative to a 
total of around 6 000), further development and implementation of e-reporting, computerised systems for 
fraud detection, and strengthening collaboration with other government bodies (for instance, the police) 
and with other countries and international organisations. In addition, a host of technical adjustments to 
legislation and regulation are in train (Box 3). Continued efforts along these lines can only be encouraged. Box 3. Recent alterations to legislation and regulation aiming to reduce tax evasion and 
aggressive avoidance Recent measures taken by the Israeli authorities to close legal loopholes have targeted the following: @BULLET Financial trusts: contributions from a foreign trust 'settlor' (i.e. the person who creates the trust, the donor) no longer produce tax-free income for Israeli beneficiaries. @BULLET  " Family "  companies. Exploitative switching by enterprises in their status for tax purposes between  " family run "  and regular businesses has been stopped. The amendment also explicitly defines the profits eligible to 
be distributed to the shareholder free of tax. @BULLET Revaluation gains. Enterprises can no longer avoid two-tiered taxation via revaluation gains. Revaluation gains are surpluses 'generated' by an increase in the value of assets and were previously subject only to 
dividend tax. @BULLET Real estate taxation. Legal changes include a narrowing of tax exemptions when property is transferred in the form of a gift. @BULLET Vehicle leasing companies. Unintended tax benefits have been removed and a depreciation rule made less generous. In addition, the campaign to counter evasion includes greater penalties for failing to report items legally requiring 
disclosure, and, aiming specifically at money laundering, reporting requirements for foreign currency dealers have 
been ramped up. Future plans aim to increase the power of the money laundering law, bring in new rules for controlled foreign 
corporations, improve tax debt collection when activities are  " rolled over "  into a new company and establish a new 
expert analyst unit. ECO/WKP(2014)9 35 The authorities should also contemplate reforms to the institutional and organisational framework of 
revenue collection: @BULLET There has been a shift internationally towards establishing more autonomous tax authorities, and 
Israel remains among a handful of countries in which the tax authority (ITA) remains a 
directorate within the Ministry of Finance (or equivalent) (OECD, 2013g). The arrangement 
echoes that of the Capital Market Savings and Insurance Division, a supervisory body that is also 
part of the Ministry of Finance. The establishment of a body that is more independent and 
genuinely outside of the Ministry should be considered, or, if not, there should be some reflection 
as to whether the ITA's relation with the rest of the Ministry requires adjustment. @BULLET In Israel, social security revenues are administered separately from the ITA's administration of 
the tax system. While this approach to revenue collection is also seen elsewhere, a growing 
number of governments have, over the past two decades, integrated the collection of tax and 
social security contributions to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to reduce the 
compliance burden on businesses (OECD, 2013g). Reform along these lines should be considered 
in Israel as part of efforts to reduce the perceived significant revenue leakage arising from 
underground economic activities where incomes go unreported (e.g. cash-in-hand payments to 
casual employees and incomes of self-employed taxpayers) in order to escape both taxation and 
social security contribution liabilities. @BULLET Increasingly, tax authorities in OECD countries are organising their operations on a  " functional "  
basis, inter alia featuring a dedicated division to administer the tax affairs of their largest 
taxpayers. In addition, many have downsized office networks given reduced needs for 
'face-to-face "  services arising increasing use of modern electronic services. The potential for 
further reforms in these areas should also be considered. Other avenues for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tax administration should continue to 
be pursued. These include embedding risk-management approaches for improving compliance across all 
segments of taxpayers and enhancing the quality of services provided. Policy efforts regarding the latter 
should focus on further developing and encouraging use of electronic services, especially web information 
and systems for the electronic filing and payment of taxes, and to encourage their use. Box 4. Recommendations on taxes and transfers Indirect tax @BULLET Should the regressivity of VAT require a policy response, use existing social welfare mechanisms rather than recourse to multiple VAT rates. Renew efforts to remove the existing exemptions on fruit and vegetables and 
services in Eilat. @BULLET Press on with the scheduled reductions in customs duties on consumer goods and food items, and maintain a strategic goal for further liberalisation. @BULLET Keep the 'green credits' but cut the basic rate of purchase tax on vehicles. Shift instead to taxing vehicle use, such as by fee-based reserved lane systems and urban congestion charging. Further tighten the tax treatment 
of company cars. Accompany these moves by expanding alternatives to car use. @BULLET Consider an economy-wide carbon tax by increasing the existing excise tax on primary fuels to levels concomitant with the estimated GHG-emissions externalities. @BULLET Continue to develop environmental levies. Remain aware of the risk of under-or over-funding from earmarking the revenues from such levies for particular areas of spending. ECO/WKP(2014)9 36 Household income tax and benefits @BULLET Broad strategy on PIT rates: avoid further hikes in PIT rates beyond what is in the pipeline. @BULLET Employment and relative poverty: − Avoid further increases in the tax wedge on low-wage labour. − Invest more in active social policies. Ensure better take up of the earned income tax credit as part of wider welfare-to-work measures, such as reforms to employment services. − Further pare back universal support, and reduce tax credits that largely benefit middle and upper income earners. For instance, lower the income ceiling introduced on access to child allowances. − Consider increases in means-tested income support, but ensure these do not create welfare traps. @BULLET Pension issues: bring the age of eligibility for the state pension for women to that for men (67 years). Pursue intended reforms of the tax treatment of pensions. Property taxation @BULLET Make capital assets deemed to be realised at death for capital gains tax purposes. Company taxes and transfers @BULLET Refrain from further raising the statutory CIT rate, and consider signalling that reductions will be resumed once budgetary conditions allow it. @BULLET As planned, review the net subsidies granted to firms, taking all tax breaks and support schemes into account. Consider narrowing eligibility for the benefits provided by the Law for the Encouragement of Capital 
Investment. @BULLET Ensure taxation is adequate in immobile sectors (such as resource extraction). @BULLET Pursue plans to reduce tax compliance costs for business by simplifying the tax code such that the number of payments paid is lower. @BULLET Reform agricultural support to improve the efficiency of the sector and its international competitiveness. Evasion, avoidance and tax administration @BULLET Press on with campaigns combatting tax evasion and aggressive avoidance. Evaluate the Israel Tax Authority's position within the Ministry of Finance with a view to either moving it outside the Ministry or to 
strengthening its independence by other means. Consider unifying the collection of tax and social security 
revenues, and adopting a  " functional "  approach to tax administration that, inter alia, includes a unit dealing with 
large taxpayers. @BULLET Press on with the further development of electronic services in tax administration. Bibliography Arnold, J. (2008),  " Do Tax Structures Affect Aggregate Economic Growth? " , OECD Economics
