Bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA)<lb/> targeting green objectives reached up to 30% of total bilateral ODA to Zambia over 2010-12 (USD 218<lb/> million) (OECD DAC CRS, 2014). 1 Importantly, the volume of green bilateral commitments increased<lb/> steadily since 2004-06 (albeit part of this increase resulted from better reporting of green ODA flows by<lb/> members of the OECD&apos;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC)), but this happened in the context of<lb/> falling ODA flows to Zambia – bilateral ODA fell from USD 1.7 billion in 2004-06 to USD 738 million in<lb/> 2010-12. 2 This illustrates the important role of green ODA in Zambia.</table>

            <table>An increasing number of African countries have formulated or are formulating green growth strategies and<lb/> policies (AfDB; 2013; AfDB and OECD, 2013; OECD, 2013). Embracing green growth can secure a<lb/> strong, stable and sustainable future for developing countries because green growth rests on recognising<lb/> and integrating the value of natural capital into economic decision-making and development planning<lb/> (OECD, 2013), thus helping to tackle pressing social issues (e.g. lack of access to basic services and<lb/> infrastructure, high vulnerability and threats to stable livelihoods from resource scarcity or<lb/> mismanagement).</table>

            <table>2004 to 2012. Section 2 discusses on-going efforts<lb/> towards greening growth in Zambia. Section 3 looks at total bilateral green Official Development<lb/> Assistance (ODA) flows from members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and<lb/> Development&apos;s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries, i.e. targeting<lb/> biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation, desertification, and other<lb/> environmental objectives. This analysis draws on OECD DAC statistics, in particular the Creditor Reporting System (CRS). 3 It describes the sectors targeted, as well as the instruments used, and discusses<lb/> the degree of alignment between Zambian priorities and providers&apos; activities. Section 4 then explores<lb/> specific provider co-ordination efforts and strategies to support the mainstreaming of green issues in-<lb/>country. The paper concludes with a number of questions that could guide further research on this topic in<lb/> Zambia and beyond.<lb/> TOWARDS GREEN GROWTH IN ZAMBIA<lb/> Zambia&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average by 6.3% over 2004-13 (World Bank, 2014)<lb/> stimulated by economic reforms, infrastructure investments, a better educated population and the<lb/> development of natural resources (Murray McIntire, 2014). A number of environmentally sensitive sectors<lb/> are responsible for this growth, notably mining (copper, cobalt, lead), tourism, agriculture (maize) or<lb/> forestry (Aongola et al., 2009; Banda and Bass, 2014). The mining sector, in particular, contributed to over<lb/> a third of Zambia&apos;s GDP and 70% of its export value on average during that period (Government of<lb/> Zambia, 2011a). Agriculture, forestry and fishing contributed another 15% and provided for up to 80% of<lb/> all livelihoods (FAO, 2009; Government of Zambia, 2010b). According to the World Bank, environmental<lb/> assets amount to 27% of all assets available for Zambia&apos;s development (with other assets being financial,<lb/> infrastructure, social, and human in nature). Cropland and forests are particularly abundant in Zambia<lb/> (World Bank, 2006), yet this figure may actually be underestimated as the measurement of environmental<lb/> assets excludes the value of many ecosystem services (Aongola et al., 2009).<lb/> The benefits of growth have not been widely shared across different income groups in Zambia. Poverty<lb/> stood at 64% of the population in 2013 (down from 68% in 1996; Government of Zambia</table>

The draft National Climate Change Response<lb/> Strategy (Government of Zambia, 2010b) and the Strategic Programme on Climate Resilience<lb/> (Climate Investment Funds, 2011), were in fact developed to implement the NDPs and to<lb/> prioritise agriculture (see Watson et al., 2012; UN-HABITAT, 2014).<lb/> • Green support to the forestry sector predominantly comes from Finland to build government<lb/> capacity to value, map and sustainably manage the country&apos;s forests (Leventon, et al., 2014). This<lb/> is aligned with the government&apos;s Zambia Forestry Action Plan and National Forest Policy of<lb/> 1998 aiming to achieve Joint Forest Management in Zambia. • The high share of green ODA in the energy sector can be attributed to the expansion of energy<lb/> access from hydro-power (Zambia is a water rich-country, accounting for 40% of the water<lb/> resources of Southern Africa; UN-HABITAT, 2014), and to the government&apos;s intentions to<lb/> continue expanding hydro-power and biofuel plants during the SNDP period (Government of<lb/> Zambia, 2010a) and to climate-proof existing infrastructure (e.g. so that droughts do not impact<lb/> negatively on energy generation which in turn affects industrial production).<lb/> • ODA to water supply and sanitation, but also to the transport and storage sector, have a green<lb/> dimension in Zambia because providers have focused on climate-proofing existing infrastructure,<lb/> as prioritised by the government&apos;s SNDP (Government of Zambia, 2010a). For example,<lb/> transport interventions comprise three environmental assessments funded by the United States,<lb/> plus other activities focusing on road construction and rehabilitation funded by Denmark and<lb/> Japan to ensure that the increased frequency and severity of floods does not destroy roads as has<lb/> happened in the past.<lb/> </figDesc>

The programme<lb/> included contracting a consultant to identify links between climate change and development, and<lb/> to suggest appropriate policies.<lb/> • A programme led by the Finnish Environmental Institute to support institutional capacity<lb/> building in the then Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR). The<lb/> programme was implemented during 2009-12 and comprised five mutually defined components:<lb/> improving human resource management (including training on environmental monitoring),<lb/> environmental information management, strategic environmental assessment, biodiversity and the<lb/> implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna<lb/> and Flora and the Basel, Stockholm, and Rotterdam Conventions.<lb/> • Finally, in 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture provided support to reduce<lb/> pollution across multiple sectors.
