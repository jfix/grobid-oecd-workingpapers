			<body>ABSTRACT <lb/>Ten years after the 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference agreed on a mandate to operationalise aid for <lb/>trade, this paper assesses the achievements and challenges of the WTO-led Initiative. After outlining the <lb/>achievements, the paper discusses where to put the emphasis, how to expand partnerships, how to enhance <lb/>effectiveness; and, most importantly, how to retain interest in using aid to make trade work for the poor. In <lb/>conclusion, the paper proposes that the Initiative could focus on promoting connectivity, boosting <lb/>sustainable investment, promoting green growth, and supporting the achievement of the Sustainable <lb/>Development Goals. The paper suggests that these aims can best be achieved through regional approaches <lb/>for tackling trade-related binding constraints with development finance from a combination of different <lb/>sources, including providers of South-South co-operation and with engagement of the private sector. <lb/></body>

			<body>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <lb/>Ten years ago, the sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization invited the Director <lb/>General to set up a task force for operationalising aid for trade with the aim of generating support for <lb/>developing countries, particularly least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-<lb/>related infrastructure they need to implement and benefit from WTO Agreements and more broadly to <lb/>expand their trade. <lb/>The task force recommended using existing mechanisms for identifying and prioritising trade-related <lb/>capacity constraints around which donors should align their support. The Paris Declaration on Aid <lb/>Effectiveness was acknowledged to provide the guiding principles for the Initiative. These principles have <lb/>created a strong partnership between the trade and development communities around a shared agenda with <lb/>clear objectives and reciprocal commitments based on mutual accountability. <lb/>The WTO Global Reviews of Aid for Trade, together with the joint OECD/WTO Aid for Trade at a <lb/>Glance monitoring reports, have shown that the Initiative has raised awarness among developing countries <lb/>and donor agencies about the positive role that trade can play in promoting economic growth and <lb/>development. Moreover, developing countries, notably the least developed, are getting better at <lb/>articulating, mainstreaming and communicating their trade-related objectives and strategies. <lb/>Cummulative aid-for-trade disbursements reached USD 245 billion and an additional USD 190 <lb/>billion in other official flows since the Initiative started in 2006. Aid-for-trade commitments stood at <lb/>USD 55.4 billion in 2013, an additional USD 30 billion or 118% increase in real terms compared to the <lb/>2002-05 baseline average. This has raised the share of aid for trade in sector-allocable aid to 38.4% in 2013 <lb/>from an average 32.5% during the baseline period. <lb/>Aid for trade is effective at both the micro and macro level according to a broad range of trade and <lb/>development literature. More specifically, OECD research found that one dollar extra invested in aid for <lb/>trade generates nearly eight additional dollars of exports from all developing countries – and twenty dollars <lb/>for the poorest countries. Results, however, may vary considerably depending on the type of aid-for-trade <lb/>intervention, the sector at which the support is directed, the income level, and the location of the recipient <lb/>country. <lb/>Aid-for-trade case stories buttress this evidence. The sheer quantity of activities described in these <lb/>case stories suggest that aid for trade is becoming central to development startegies and has taken root <lb/>across a wide spectrum of countries and activities. Although not always easy to atribute cause and effect, <lb/>the stories show tangible evidence of how aid for trade is helping countries build the human, institutional <lb/>and infrastructural capacities for turning trade opportunities into trade flow and helping men and women <lb/>make a more decent living. <lb/>Building trade-capacities is an ongoing process. The continued need for the Aid for Trade Initiative <lb/>is obvious; tackling trade-related binding constraints requires persistent efforts in a globalising economy <lb/>where connectivity is key for success. This is especially true with trade growing at a slower pace than <lb/>before. Despite the significant achievements of the Initiative over the past ten years, challenges remain in <lb/>keeping it relevant. <lb/>The role of the private sector should be strengthened further. Much progress has already been <lb/>made in involving the private sector, but engagement could be intensified through creating shared multi-<lb/>stakeholder value and by scaling up and systematically including the private sector in the different stages <lb/>of the aid-for-trade project cycle. Such engagement should, however, respect multilateral agreements <lb/>which discipline the potential distortion of trade flows with aid money. <lb/></body>

			<body>Engage with the providers of South-South trade-related co-operation who supply substantial <lb/>sources of assistance in Asia, Latin America, and especially in Africa. Although some are transparent <lb/>about their support, increased comparability and co-operation with DAC donors would help reduce <lb/>institutional and human capacity constraints at the local level as well as facilitate co-ordination among the <lb/>different providers of trade-related support. This would also help in creating a level playing field among <lb/>the different providers of trade-related assistance. <lb/>Enhance effectiveness through regional programmes. Deepening economic integration via regional <lb/>co-operation is a key priority in the reform strategies of most developing economies. It is also actively <lb/>promoted by donors, who collectively committed USD 3.1 billion to regional priorities in 2013. These <lb/>programmes can be made even more effective by involving an honest broker to help find common ground <lb/>among countries, offering financial incentives, building human and institutional capacities, and <lb/>harmonising regulations. <lb/>Experiment with new forms of aid delivery to enhance mutual accountability and provide <lb/>incentives for more and better aid for trade. Focussing aid-for-trade programmes on quantifiable targets, <lb/>would allow for the experimenting with results-focussed approaches, such as budget support, or payment <lb/>for performance. <lb/>Focus on connectivity and trade costs to provide an operational focal point for an action-oriented <lb/>agenda among a broad collation of stakeholders, including the providers of South-South co-operation and <lb/>the private sector. The advantages of such targets are also that they are neutral in the sense of benefiting <lb/>not just exporters, but also importers and households. <lb/>Expand the scope to sustainable investment. The initial emphasis should be on trade in services, <lb/>with a focus on those sectors that are central to promoting sustainable development, such as agriculture, <lb/>energy and transport. Donor support in this area could tackle a range of issues such as transparency. <lb/>Promote green growth. Aid for trade should support developing countries in moving to sustainable <lb/>agriculture, building climate-resilient infrastructure, strengthening the supply chain of low-carbon <lb/>technologies and environmental goods and services, and more generally helping them with achieving green <lb/>growth. <lb/>Play a catalytic role in supporting the SDGs. The SDGs highlight that &quot; (…) increasing aid-for-trade <lb/>support for developing countries, in particular the least developed (…) &quot; would help to &quot; (…) promote <lb/>sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work <lb/>for all. &quot; <lb/>The Initiative should focus on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the trade <lb/>and development landscape. In response to the changing nature of the world economy and its rising <lb/>complexity, new analytical approaches are needed to better understand the trade-offs and <lb/>complementarities between policy objectives – e.g. between growth promoting policies and equity and <lb/>environmental concerns. Addressing these concerns and dealing with these interlinkages requires <lb/>integrated approaches that breakdown silos between policy communities. The Aid for Trade Initiative <lb/>should be an integral part of this new approach to policy which is essential if we want to deliver the <lb/>Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Tenth WTO Ministerial Conference in Kenya in <lb/>December 2015 offers an opportune moment to take stock of the achievements of the Aid for Trade <lb/>Initiative and reflect on how to continue its relevance in the changing trade and development <lb/>landscape. <lb/></body>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>History has shown that openness to trade is a key ingredient for economic success and raising living <lb/>standards. Countries that have pursued an outward-oriented development strategy with trade liberalisation <lb/>at its heart, have not only outperformed inward-looking economies in terms of aggregate growth rates, but <lb/>have also succeeded in lowering poverty rates and registering improvements in other indicators of social <lb/>progress. Successive rounds of multilateral trade liberalisation, increasing numbers of preferential market <lb/>access schemes and regional free trade agreements as well as expanding South-South trade have created <lb/>many more trading opportunities for developing countries. <lb/>Supply-side capacity limitations and trade-related infrastructure gaps continue to prevent some <lb/>developing countries from converting new trade opportunities into actual trade flows. Moreover, onerous <lb/>regulatory requirements together with superfluous restrictive policies increase the cost of doing business, <lb/>which weighs especially heavy on firms in developing countries. In a global economy characterised by <lb/>fragmented production chains, these costs hamper international connectivity and limit the contribution of <lb/>trade to economic growth and poverty reduction. <lb/>The aid for trade partnership <lb/>The Aid for Trade Initiative was launched at the 2005 Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Conference to <lb/>tackle these trade-related binding constraints and to distribute the benefits of trade more equitably across <lb/>and within developing countries. The initiative is guided by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. <lb/>Properly applied, the underlying principles lead to mutual accountability based on a shared agenda with <lb/>clear objectives and reciprocal commitments. This should create incentives for more and better aid for <lb/>trade. <lb/>…build on transparency,… <lb/>The WTO in collaboration with the OECD has created a monitoring framework to track progress in <lb/>implementing the Aid for Trade Initiative in order to enhance its credibility. As a tool it is best <lb/>characterised as a spotlight, not a microscope – which allows for reviewing at a global level progress made <lb/>locally and regionally. The monitoring exercise is based on self-assessments, data on aid-for-trade proxies <lb/>extracted from the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), and aid-for-trade country profiles that track <lb/>performance between development finance inputs and trade and development results. This is buttressed by <lb/>case stories on what works and what doesn&apos;t work in aid-for-trade programmes, research from international <lb/>governmental organisation, non-governmental organisations, findings from independent evaluations and <lb/>academic research. <lb/>…mutual accountability... <lb/>The monitoring framework which follows the logic framework underpinning the Aid for Trade <lb/>Initiative features three accountability mechanisms with the following objectives: <lb/>• At the local level, to foster local ownership and ensure that trade-related needs are prioritised in <lb/>national development strategies and adequately funded by the donor community;<lb/>• At the regional level, to focus attention on regional trade-related constraints and growth <lb/>opportunities and where needed galvanise collective action;<lb/>• At the global level, to increase transparency about what is happening at the local and regional <lb/>levels, what is not, and where improvements are needed.<lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1: Aid for trade logical framework <lb/>Source OECD (2006) <lb/>…adapting to changing environments. <lb/>Since the operationalisation of the Aid for Trade Initiative in 2006, the trade and development <lb/>landscape has evolved considerably. The development paradigm is witnessing a shift of attention from <lb/>official development assistance to external development finance and domestic resource mobilization. More <lb/>importantly, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) encourage the transformation of natural resource-<lb/>dependent growth patterns into more inclusive and sustainable ones, while the Conference of the Parties to <lb/>the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) meeting at the end of 2015 strives for an <lb/>agreement on putting the world on track to a low-carbon, sustainable future. <lb/>Trade volumes today are growing roughly in line with GDP, compared with growth rates about twice <lb/>as fast as output over the period from the mid-1980s to 2000. This slower growth rate is not only the result <lb/>of sluggish GDP growth, but also because the relationship between trade and GDP has changed in recent <lb/>years (Constantinescu et al, 2015). In trade policy the focus of analysis is shifting from countries to firms <lb/>and value chains; from industries to tasks and business functions; from stocks to flows; and from public to <lb/>private trade barriers. <lb/>Notwithstanding these changes in the trade and development landscape, it is clear that there is still <lb/>considerable scope to enhance the international division of labour by further integrating countries that have <lb/>heretofore remained marginally engaged in trade in general and in regional and global value chains in <lb/>particular. The Tenth WTO Ministerial Conference in Kenya offers an opportune moment to take stock of <lb/>the achievements of the Aid for Trade Initiative and reflect on how to continue its relevance in this <lb/>changing trade and development landscape. <lb/>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 looks at the achievements of the <lb/>Initiative in terms of additional official development financing for tackling trade-related binding <lb/>constraints and the results of these programmes in improving trade performance and reducing poverty. <lb/>Section 3 discusses challenges that need to be addressed to keep the Initiative relevant, inclusive and <lb/>results focused. Section 4 addresses how to expand the partnership with the private sector and with the <lb/>providers of South-South trade-related co-operation. Section 5 suggests that effectiveness could be further <lb/>improved through regional programmes and experimenting with new forms of aid delivery. Section 6 <lb/>analyses how a focus on connectivity, sustainable investment, green growth and the SDG could <lb/>reinvigorate the Initiative and rekindle donor interest. Section 7 concludes. <lb/></body>

			<body>WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED? <lb/>This section reviews the achievements of the Aid for Trade Initiative in terms of its stated objectives <lb/>to &quot; help developing countries, particularly LDCs, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-related <lb/>infrastructure that they need to implement and benefit from WTO Agreements and more broadly to expand <lb/>their trade. &quot; Furthermore, &quot; effective aid for trade should enhance growth prospects, reduce poverty, <lb/>complement multilateral trade reforms, and distribute the global benefits of trade more equitably across <lb/>and within developing countries &quot; (WTO, 2006). <lb/>Prioritising trade … <lb/>Central to the whole Aid for Trade Initiative is the notion that trade should be (better) mainstreamed <lb/>as a priority in the strategies of developing countries and donor agencies. Most donor agencies have <lb/>reported that they have specific aid for trade strategies. Some donors such as European Commission <lb/>Germany and the United Kingdom are in the process of updating their strategies. UNDP (2011) and <lb/>Brenton et al (2014) find that while progress has been observed in mainstreaming trade in developing <lb/>countries, capacities remain uneven. The high number of countries that have actively participated in <lb/>successive monitoring exercises that underpin the biennial Global Reviews of Aid for Trade, as well as a <lb/>recent review of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies undertaken by the Executive Secretariat of the <lb/>Enhanced Integrated Framework suggest that progress in this area continues. 2 <lb/>...also at the regional level… <lb/>Deepening economic integration via regional economic co-operation has emerged as a priority in the <lb/>reform strategies of many developing countries. This is evidenced by the exponential growth in regional <lb/>trading arrangement in which they now participate. Such co-operation can sub-regional, regional or inter-<lb/>regional; South-South or North-South; formal or informal. Whatever the modalities, it is clear that <lb/>developing countries ae placing an increased emphasis on regional trade and investment integration. This is <lb/>also reflected in the growing number of regional Aid for Trade strategies that have been developed such as <lb/>in 2012 by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), in 2013 by the Caribbean <lb/>Community (CARICOM), in 2013 by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in 2013 <lb/>Central Africa and in the Pacific (2014). An Aid for Trade strategy for the Economic Community of West <lb/>African States (ECOWAS) is also under discussion. <lb/>…attracting more ODA … <lb/>Prioritising of trade as a tool for economic growth and poverty reduction was expected to result in <lb/>securing &quot; additional, predictable, sustainable and effective financing for building trade capacities in <lb/>developing countries &quot; . To assess additionality and ensure accurate accounting at the global level, aid-for-<lb/>trade benchmarks were agreed. These include: official development assistance (ODA) and other official <lb/>flows (OOF) to help developing countries elaborate trade strategies, negotiate trade agreements and <lb/>implement their outcomes; build roads, ports and telecommunications networks to connect domestic <lb/>markets to the global economy; support the private sector, exploit their comparative advantages and <lb/>diversify their exports; help with the costs associated with trade liberalisation such as tariff reductions, <lb/>preference erosion or declining terms of trade; and, finally, other trade-related needs if identified as trade-<lb/>related priorities in partner countries&apos; national development strategies (figure 2). 3 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 2: Aid for Trade CRS categories <lb/>Source OECD (2006) <lb/>…increasing disbursements, and … <lb/>Since the Initiative was launched in 2006, a total of USD 246.5 billion in official development <lb/>assistance has been disbursed by bilateral and multilateral donors for financing aid-for-trade programmes <lb/>and projects. Support for programmes aimed at reducing the infrastructure gap in developing countries <lb/>received USD 128.9 billion, while programmes targeted at building productive capacities took <lb/>USD 109.6 billion. Aid for trade in its narrowest sense of support for trade policy and regulation attracted a <lb/>total of USD 7.6 billion and USD 60 million was spent on easing trade-related adjustment cost; one of the <lb/>original arguments for the Aid for Trade Initiative. To date, more than three quarters of total aid for trade <lb/>has financed projects in four sectors: transport and storage (29%), energy generation and supply (21%), <lb/>agriculture (18%) and banking and financial services (10%) (figure 3). Geographically, 146 developing <lb/>countries received aid-for-trade assistance, mainly in Asia (38.4%) and Africa (35.1%). In terms of <lb/>population, the least developed countries received USD 10 per capita in aid for trade; the highest compared <lb/>to other income groups and more than double the average aid for trade per capita. <lb/>Figure 3: Aid for Trade Sector Distribution 2002 -2013: <lb/>(Constant 2013 USD billions) <lb/>Source OECD/DAC/CRS <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>60 <lb/>2002-05 <lb/>avg. <lb/>2006-08 <lb/>avg. <lb/>2009-11 <lb/>avg. <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>2006-08 <lb/>avg. <lb/>2009-11 <lb/>avg. <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>Trade Policy &amp; Regulations <lb/>Economic Infrastructure <lb/>Building Productive Capacity <lb/>Commitments <lb/>Disbursements <lb/></body>

			<body>…doubling commitments … <lb/>In 2013, commitments reached USD 55.4 billion, an increase of USD 1.8 billion in real terms <lb/>compared to 2012 and an additional USD 30.1 billion or 118% in real terms compared with the 2002-05 <lb/>baseline average (figure 3). This increased the share of aid for trade in sector-allocable aid from an average <lb/>of 32.5% during the baseline period to 38.4% in 2013. Thus, within the expanding ODA budget envelope <lb/>the share of aid for trade has increased even more. The 5.3 basis point increase could be considered as <lb/>additional aid for trade. <lb/>…also of OOF… <lb/>In addition, since 2006 USD 190.8 billion in gross trade-related other official flows (OOF) has been <lb/>disbursed (figure 4). A large increase was pay out by the international finance institutions right after the <lb/>2007/08 financial crises. Most of this non-concessional funding supported projects in economic <lb/>infrastructure (47%) and building productive capacities (52%) and almost exclusively in middle-income <lb/>countries (92%). Asia is also the main beneficiary of trade-related OOF at USD 72.5 billion, or 38% of the <lb/>total support. At USD 30.75 billion, Africa is surpassed by middle income countries in Latin America and <lb/>the Caribbean and Europe, with USD 45.9 billion and USD 38.7 billion, respectively. <lb/>Figure 4: Trade-Related gross OOF disbursements, aggregate 2002-2013 <lb/>Source OECD/DAC/CRS <lb/>…building trade capacities, … <lb/>The significant amount of ODA and OOF spent to support developing countries building their trade <lb/>capacities through improving infrastructure, invigorating the private sector and streamlining their trade <lb/>policies should show results. Empirical literature confirms that aid for trade, in general, is effective at both <lb/>the micro and macro level (Velde te et al, 2013). The impacts, however, may vary considerably depending <lb/>on the type of aid-for-trade intervention, the income level, the sector at which the support is directed and <lb/>geographical region of the recipient country. For example, Ferro et al. (2012) found that a 10% increase in <lb/>aid to transportation, information, communication and technology, energy, and banking services is <lb/>associated with increases of 2.0%, 0.3%, 6.8% and 4.7% respectively in the exports of manufactured goods <lb/>from the recipient countries. <lb/></body>

Cali and te Velde (2011) examined the <lb/>impact of aid for trade on trade costs and exports and found that a USD 1 million increase in aid-for-trade <lb/>facilitation is associated with a 6% reduction in the cost of packing, loading and shipping to the transit hub. <lb/>Busse et al (2012), using panel data for 99 developing countries for the period 2004-09, show that aid for <lb/>trade is closely associated with lowering trade costs and therefore may play an important role in helping <lb/>developing countries benefit from trade. Cirera and Winters (2015) find a positive impact on exporting and <lb/>importing times, but factors other than aid for trade explain different experiences of structural change in <lb/>sub-Saharan African countries. <lb/>…increasing trade, and… <lb/>Helbe et al. (2012) empirically assess the relationship between different aid-for-trade categories and <lb/>trade performance. They find that a 1% increase in aid for trade facilitation could generate a <lb/>USD 415 million increase in global trade. An evaluation of USAID (2010) trade assistance that focused on <lb/>export expansion, trade policy reforms, increased participation in trade agreements, and efficiency gains <lb/>from trade facilitation assistance, finds that each additional one US dollar increases the value of developing <lb/>country exports by USD 42 two years later. OECD/WTO (2013a) finds that one US dollar invested in aid <lb/>for trade is on average associated with an increase of nearly eight US dollars in exports from all developing <lb/>countries and an increase of twenty US dollars in exports from the poorest countries. These effects were <lb/>found to be even higher for exports of parts and components. <lb/>…reducing poverty <lb/>Martuscelli and Winters (2014) on the basis of a literature review conclude that trade liberalisation <lb/>generally boosts income and thus reduces poverty, with working in the export sector predicting gains and <lb/>in the import-competing sector losses. A fairly common finding is that female workers gain from trade <lb/>liberalisation. De Melo and Wagner (2014) confirm these findings and show that aid for trade has also <lb/>helped reduce poverty through other channels. For example, targeted aid to building productive capacities <lb/>in agriculture and insurance schemes to remove risks can raise the productivity of households close to the <lb/>poverty line. Road rehabilitation can also reduce the monopsonistic power of traders in remote areas, <lb/>thereby raising the incomes of the poor selling agricultural products. <lb/>These empirical findings are illustrated by the results reported in the 111 case stories that the public <lb/>and the private sector submitted in the context of the 2015 OECD/WTO monitoring exercise (Figure 5). <lb/>Figure 5: Aggregate results from 111 aid-for-trade case stories <lb/>Note: multiple responses were allowed <lb/>Source: OECD/WTO Aid for Trade Case Stories (2015) <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>20 <lb/>25 <lb/>30 <lb/>35 <lb/>40 <lb/>45 <lb/>50 <lb/>Increase in remittances <lb/>Import market diversification <lb/>Poverty Reduction <lb/>Increase in per capita income <lb/>Increase in consumer welfare <lb/>Increase in women&apos;s employment <lb/>Increase in domestic investment <lb/>Increase in foreign investment <lb/>Increase in employment <lb/>Export market diversification <lb/>Number of results reported <lb/></body>

			<body>The case stories about aid-for-trade priorities, policies and programmes mention 299 results. The most <lb/>important ones are export market diversification (47 times), an increase in employment, including for <lb/>women (45 and 27 times, respectively), an increase in foreign and domestic investment (37 and 33 times, <lb/>respectively). These results are closely followed by a reported rise in per capita income (25 times) and <lb/>poverty reduction (18 times). The findings are rather similar to those reported in the 2011 exercise. <lb/>However, any conclusion from the collection of case stories must be tempered by the awareness of its <lb/>selection biases (OECD/WTO, 2014; Newfarmer, 2014). <lb/>REMAINING CHALLENGES <lb/>The continued need for the Aid for Trade Initiative is obvious; tackling trade-related binding <lb/>constraints is ongoing process that gains in urgency in a world in which connectivity is essential for <lb/>economic success. To continue to ensure that the Initiative remains relevant, there are continued questions <lb/>that warrant consideration about what the sector and country focus should be and how best to share <lb/>knowledge. <lb/>Which focus? <lb/>The question of the appropriate focus of the Aid for Trade Initiative has never been conclusively <lb/>settled, as is evident from the views summarised above. At first sight, an economically rational definition <lb/>of aid for trade would be based on trade competitiveness. This competitiveness is determined by two main <lb/>factors: (i) domestic productivity as expressed though production and trade costs, which set the cost of <lb/>moving goods and services and (ii) the level of effective market access, which is a function of unilateral, <lb/>preferential, regional or multilateral trade reforms and the capacity to meet standards and overcome <lb/>information gaps regarding export markets. Unfortunately, however, this type of definition does not <lb/>differentiate between an aid-for-trade agenda on the one hand and the agenda for economic development <lb/>on the other (OECD, 2006). The Task Force on Aid for Trade bypassed this problem and defined aid for <lb/>trade as those trade-related programmes and projects that are prioritised in national development strategies <lb/>(WTO, 2006). In practise, few countries have the capacity to report on the official financial support they <lb/>receive for their trade-related priorities. At the global level this inability has resulted in equating the CRS <lb/>proxies used for assessing additionality with the definition of aid for trade. <lb/>Which countries? <lb/>Gamberoni and Newfarmer (2014) developed a methodology to identify empirically the potential aid-<lb/>for-trade needs of countries. They find that aid-for-trade commitments as a share of GDP are larger in <lb/>recipient countries with greater needs, although the match is not perfect. The World Economic Forum <lb/>(2015) analysed the distribution of aid-for-trade disbursements against countries&apos; score on the WEF <lb/>Enabling Trade Index (ETI) and find that disbursements have largely been aligned with developing <lb/>countries&apos; needs. Those countries which score relatively worse in the ETI generally received <lb/>proportionately more aid since the start of the Aid for Trade Initiative (Figure 6). There are exceptions, <lb/>especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where some economies have so far received relatively few resources in <lb/>light of their needs. Gamberoni and Newfarmer suggest that this might be due to other pressing <lb/>development priorities that require external development finance, or to the fact that the constraints do not <lb/>demand much money to resolve. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 6: Enabling Trade Index (2010) compared to average (2005–12) AfT disbursements as share of GDP <lb/>Source WEF/ETI – OECD/CRS <lb/>Which constraints? <lb/>Developing countries face numerous and multifaceted constraints preventing them from turning trade <lb/>opportunities into trade expansion and subsequent growth response. With limited political capital and finite <lb/>aid-for-trade resources, reforms need to focus on the most binding constraints. These constraints differ, <lb/>although commonality do exist at the aggregate level among countries groupings such as land-locked, or <lb/>small and vulnerable. Country specific trade-related binding constraints can be identified through a variety <lb/>of analytical tools, such as, differential diagnostics, growth diagnostic, value chain analysis, stakeholder <lb/>consultation or through a combination of them. This is being done in the Diagnostics Trade Integration <lb/>Studies that the Enhanced integrated Framework undertakes in the Least Developed Countries. To <lb/>maximise the development benefits of trade-led growth close attention should be paid to different <lb/>transmission channels and the impact of trade in terms of employment (export-orientated or import-<lb/>competing), sector (manufacture – services), geography (both rural and urban poor) and gender (both poor <lb/>women and men). Finally, for trade to promote growth and for the poor to benefit, complementary policies <lb/>are essential to facilitate their adjustment (OECD, 2011). <lb/>How to share knowledge? <lb/>Building on progress to date, Hoekman (2010) suggests creating a new aid-for-trade public-private <lb/>partnership to leverage the dynamism in the private sector for strengthening trade capacity. In addition, he <lb/>suggests launching a G-20 global initiative to provide dedicated financial support for collecting cross-<lb/>country datasets to allow for more effective monitoring and evaluation of aid for trade. Cadot et al (2011) <lb/>also took up the issue of better monitoring and evaluating and advocate that rising demands for results and <lb/>accountability from donors and clients alike require that aid-for-trade evaluations need more ambition and <lb/>rigour. Following the 2013 Agreement on Trade Facilitation, Hallaert (2013) proposes to narrow the scope <lb/>of the Initiative to only trade policy and regulations and complement it with independent and robust impact <lb/>evaluations and research hosted by the World Bank or others. OECD (2013a) proposes an alternative <lb/>between traditional ex post evaluations and costly impact assessments. Such a management tool would help <lb/>focussing aid-for-trade programmes on quantifiable objectives and measuring trade-related and <lb/>development performance on the basis of a limited set of indicators that are mutually agreed between <lb/>developing countries and donors. <lb/>0.00% <lb/>0.50% <lb/>1.00% <lb/>1.50% <lb/>2.00% <lb/>2.50% <lb/>3.00% <lb/>3.50% <lb/>2 <lb/>2.5 <lb/>3 <lb/>3.5 <lb/>4 <lb/>4.5 <lb/>5 <lb/>5.5 <lb/>6 <lb/>2010 ETI score <lb/>Linear (2010 ETI score) <lb/></body>

			<body>IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS <lb/>In general, aid-for-trade programmes are found to be relatively effective. For example, the <lb/>International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and the South Asia Watch on <lb/>Trade, Economics &amp; Environment (SAWTEE) (2013) conclude on the basis of case studies in eight <lb/>developing countries, including four LDCs (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malawi, and Nepal), three LMICs <lb/>(Ghana, Guatemala, and the Philippines) and one UMIC (Peru) that aid for trade is effective under the right <lb/>conditions. However, often these conditions are lacking, despite them being the focus of aid-for-trade <lb/>programmes. Overall, they suggest that their findings do not radically differ from what has emerged from <lb/>the more general aid effectiveness debate. In that respect, aid for trade is no exception and might actually <lb/>have done slightly better in those countries than other areas that are financed with ODA. The next section <lb/>suggests that further improvements might be obtained through regional programmes and through <lb/>experiments with new forms of aid delivery. <lb/>…through regional programmes, and... <lb/>Given the relatively small market size in many developing countries, it is clear that sustained economic <lb/>growth needs to rely in part on creating larger, more viable markets through the rule-based sharing of <lb/>resources and production assets. Deepening economic integration via regional co-operation has thus <lb/>emerged as a key priority in the reform strategies of most developing economies, even if with differing <lb/>degrees of political commitment. Regional aid for trade is contributing to this integration process with <lb/>commitments almost tripling from an average of USD 1.2 billion during the 2002-05 baseline to <lb/>USD 3.1 billion in 2013, although its share remains still only 5.5% of total aid for trade. <lb/>Regional aid for trade is hampered by many practical complications, from technical standards to <lb/>financing issues, while negotiations can be bogged down by poor inter-governmental communications and <lb/>sometimes by lack of trust across negotiating parties (OECD, 2014b). In fact, regional aid for trade is still <lb/>insufficiently understood and appreciated in national line ministries and among stakeholders including <lb/>among donors. Moreover, implementing regional strategies is complicated by problems such as <lb/>membership of overlapping regional organisations; lack of implementation of regional agreements; poor <lb/>articulation of regional priorities within national strategies; and national and regional capacity constraints. <lb/>This creates major complications in terms of ownership, mainstreaming and aligning national strategies <lb/>around regional aid-for-trade priorities. <lb/>New approaches have emerged including multi-donor programmes such as TradeMark East Africa, 4 <lb/>or regional initiatives such as USAID African Trade Hubs 5 to address these problems. These approaches <lb/>are based around trade and transport corridors and hubs, with active outreach to public and private <lb/>investors. In addition, challenges surrounding regional programmes can be tackled through the following <lb/>approaches: <lb/>• involve an &apos;honest broker&apos; such as Regional Development Banks which offer institutional <lb/>mechanisms to better co-ordinate regional and sub-regional programmes among countries;<lb/>• offer financial incentives such as a higher concessionality level for financing regional <lb/>programmes than for purely national programmes;<lb/>• build institutional and human capacities to respond to a wide variety of technical assistance <lb/>needs covering a range of disciplines, including trade policy, customs, transport, and enterprise <lb/>development;<lb/></body>

			<body>• harmonise regulations, which makes it both a challenge as well as an opportunity to increasing <lb/>the potential to boost regional integration.<lb/>…experimenting with new forms of aid delivery. <lb/>A proliferation of new approaches, such as &quot; payments for performance &quot; , &quot; output-based aid &quot; , or <lb/> &quot; results-based financing &quot; are advocated as more effective than traditional forms of aid delivery. <lb/>Ramanchandran et al (2014) highlights that these forms of results-based management are promoted for a <lb/>variety of reasons based on different theories of how linking disbursements to results will ensure more <lb/>effective programs: by appealing to governments&apos; pecuniary interests to shift domestic priorities; by <lb/>drawing the attention of politicians and managers to results; by establishing accountability to constituents; <lb/>and by giving recipients discretion to engage in local problem-solving. <lb/>Most budget support programmes try to create a partnership in sharing responsibility between funders <lb/>and recipients. Such a partnership should create opportunities for policy dialogue, mutual accountability <lb/>with reference to performance and provision of funds that feed into and improve the receiving countries <lb/>own financial, budgeting, and implementation capacities Savedoff (2011). One example is the Millennium <lb/>Challenge Corporation (MCC), a U.S. development program that applies the principle of country <lb/>selectivity to its programs. 6 <lb/>Based on the MCC model, the Centre for Global Development proposes a &quot; Doing Business Facility &quot; , <lb/>which would determine a country&apos;s eligibility for technical and financial assistance on the basis of third-<lb/>party measurements of its performance in addressing business-sector constraints. The facility would use <lb/>performance-based filters to identify a few reforming countries each year and then implement program <lb/>agreements to reinforce and advance further reforms to the business climate. The facility would both target <lb/>assistance on countries that will use it well and create reform incentives for thresholds countries (CGD, <lb/>2010). <lb/>Ramachandran (2014) proposes &quot; Service Performance Guarantees &quot; as an extension of results-based <lb/>aid, but one that provides a different pattern of accountability – of a &quot; partnership &quot; of donors and recipient <lb/>governments towards the private sector. This is in contrast to conventional results-based aid approaches <lb/>that condition disbursement of donors&apos; funds to recipient governments on the achievement of service <lb/>outputs or outcomes without a direct link to the ultimate clients for the services. The Guarantees would <lb/>instead pay private firms when commitments – for example to reform regulation or improve infrastructure <lb/>– were not met. Such a scheme would raise many political and legal questions, but might offer an <lb/>innovative approach to improve the business climate. <lb/>Focussing the Aid for Trade Initiative more on reducing trade costs would allow for the introduction <lb/>of these results-focussed approaches. However, it is questionable whether partner countries would <lb/>welcome accountability programmes that condition the availability of aid for trade on their quantifiable <lb/>progress towards trade cost reduction. Developing country support for accountability programmes would <lb/>certainly be higher if the focus were on an assessment of donor performance. For instance, Rwanda has <lb/>introduced this kind of assessment with the aim of raising incomes to a level in 2020 where aid is no longer <lb/>necessary (OECD, 2013a). <lb/>EXPANDING PARTNERSHIPS <lb/>The Aid for Trade Initiative has succeeded in creating a fact-based dialogue among the trade and <lb/>development community on how to best use aid to make trade work for development. This discussion has <lb/>been especially fruitful among officials from bilateral and multilateral donors and trade negotiators who <lb/>meet regularly in the WTO Committee on Trade and Development.

			<body>developing and developed countries) has been more challenging, although much has already been <lb/>achieved. The same holds true for the increasing importance of the providers of South-South trade-related <lb/>capacity building programmes. The next section will discuss how to expand these partnerships further. <lb/>With the private sector, and… <lb/>The pivotal role of the private sector has always been recognised in the Aid for Trade Initiative <lb/>and considerable progress has been made. For instance, the International Trade Centre has reached out to <lb/>small and medium sized enterprises in developing countries. The International Chamber of Commerce <lb/>(ICC) has solicited views from their constituencies on the binding trade-related constraints they are facing <lb/>in trying to connect local firms to their value chains. The World Economic Forum has used its research <lb/>findings to benchmark bottlenecks in trade expansion and on that basis engaged its members in the aid-for-<lb/>trade dialogue. Furthermore, in recognition of the important role of the private sector, a number of <lb/>government donors, together with the ICC, the WEF, and the Centre for International Private Enterprise <lb/>(CIPE), have establish the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation — an international public-private sector <lb/>coalition designed to streamline border management in developing countries as part of the implementation <lb/>of the new WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.. <lb/>In addition, a new generation of programmes is emerging, involving donors, partner countries, and <lb/>private firms in both developing and donor countries. The results of these programmes have been judged as <lb/>largely positive: they have helped firms develop new products, increase their exports and save costs. In <lb/>addition, the results are aligned with the objectives of the development community, such as: improved <lb/>workers&apos; skills, better working conditions, improved health among workers, job creation, poverty <lb/>alleviation, and improved environmental performance. Consumers have also benefitted from lower prices. <lb/>The main drivers of the engagement in donor countries are company-based and relate to firms&apos; core <lb/>business strategies, while the corporate social responsibility agenda of firms also explains their actions in <lb/>this area (OECD/WTO, 2015). <lb/>Strengthening private sector engagement further could be achieved by creating shared multi-<lb/>stakeholder value and building platforms for project-based collaboration. Such reinforced partnership <lb/>could be forged by scaling up and systematically including the private sector in the four different stages of <lb/>the aid-for-trade project life cycle (figure 7). <lb/>1. identification of the projects to alleviate binding trade-related constraints, where the views of the <lb/>private sector could be solicited to provide information about obstacles to be removed or <lb/>incentives to be improved; <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 7: Public private partnerships for managing trade related programmes <lb/>Expanding the partnership with the private sector should respect a number of international agreements <lb/>which discipline the potential distortion of trade flows with aid money. Thus, involving the private sector <lb/>in donor programmes should not reintroduce the bad practice of tying aid to donor companies. The OECD <lb/>Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits offers an extensive framework for the orderly use of <lb/>officially supported export credits, while the 2001 DAC Recommendation unties ODA to the LDCs and <lb/>HPICs. 7 The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures contains binding disciplines for <lb/>the use of subsidies. 8 <lb/>…providers of South-South co-operation <lb/>The contribution of South-South co-operation is an important characteristic of the Aid for Trade <lb/>Initiative. South-South providers have become substantial sources of financial assistance in Asia, Latin <lb/>America, and especially in Africa. China and India are two of the leaders in this field (table 1). Typically, <lb/>they combine investment and enhanced market access opportunities with delivering expertise and financial <lb/>support to foster the economic and social welfare of other developing countries (Zimmermann and Smith, <lb/>2011). In addition, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), launched in Beijing in October 2014 <lb/>and expected to be operational at the end of 2015, aims to provide finance for infrastructure projects in the <lb/>Asia Region, together with the Silk Road Fund and the planned BRICS bank. <lb/>Table 1: Estimates of development co-operation flows from providers not reporting to the OECD-DAC <lb/>(gross, USD millions, current prices) <lb/>Country <lb/>2010 <lb/>2011 <lb/>2012 <lb/>2013 <lb/>Source <lb/>Brazil <lb/>500 <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>.. <lb/>Institute of Applied Economic Research and <lb/>Brazilian Co-operation Agency <lb/>China <lb/>2 561 <lb/>2 776 <lb/>3 114 <lb/>3 009 Fiscal Yearbook, Ministry of Finance <lb/>India 1 <lb/>709 <lb/>788 <lb/>1 076 <lb/>1 257 Annual Reports, Ministry of Foreign Affairs <lb/>Indonesia <lb/>10 <lb/>17 <lb/>27 <lb/>12 Ministry of National Development Planning <lb/>South Africa 1,2 <lb/>151 <lb/>227 <lb/>188 <lb/>183 Estimates of Public Expenditures 2013, National Treasury <lb/>.. = not available. <lb/>1) Figures for India and South Africa are based on their fiscal years.

			<body>increased comparability of support efforts would help reduce institutional and human capacity constraints <lb/>at the local level as well as facilitate co-ordination among different providers of development finance for <lb/>trade. It would also facilitate enhancing the role of North-South, South-South and triangular regional and <lb/>international co-operation in providing access to science, technology and innovation, as suggested by the <lb/>SDG. <lb/>BREAKING DOWN SILOS <lb/>Notwithstanding the tangible achievements of the Initiative, interest in trade as a tool for development <lb/>appears to be waning in some quarters of the donor community. Although others, such as Australia most <lb/>recently, have announced making aid for trade a central tenet of their development programme. <lb/>Nevertheless, the donor narrative is moving towards domestic resource mobilisation, the promotion of <lb/>foreign direct investment and private sector development and engagement. These are important objectives <lb/>in their own right, but their contribution to development will remain suboptimal if they are pursued in <lb/>isolation from or even instead of promoting international trade. In fact, foreign trade remains in many cases <lb/>the single most important source of external development finance, particularly to small developing <lb/>countries and LDCs. <lb/>Part of the reason for the diminishing interest among some donors in trade as an engine of economic <lb/>growth and development seems to be linked to the continued stalemate in the negotiations on the Doha <lb/>Development Agenda and the related trend towards mega-regional trade negotiations (which largely <lb/>exclude the LDCs). However, when trade agreements are concluded, the donor community does re-engage <lb/>forcefully. For example, developing countries report that trade-related assistance is forthcoming as one of <lb/>the outcomes of preferential trading arrangements, such as the Economic Partnership Agreements. <lb/>Furthermore, donors support for Trade Facilitation surged after the 2013 Bali Agreement to <lb/>USD 680 million; an eight-fold increase compared to the average 2002-05 baseline. <lb/>Refocussing the Aid for Trade Initiative on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the trade <lb/>and development landscape should reinvigorate donor interest. In response to the changing nature of the <lb/>world economy, its rising complexity, and its shifting patterns of trade and investment flows, new <lb/>analytical approaches are needed to better understand the trade-offs and complementarities between policy <lb/>objectives – e.g. between growth promoting policies and equity and environmental concerns (OECD, <lb/>2015a). Addressing these concerns and dealing with these interlinkages requires integrated approaches that <lb/>breakdown silos between policy communities (Tett, 2015). The next section suggests that the Initiative <lb/>might benefit from a more integrated approach to pressing trade and development challenges such as <lb/>improving connectivity, boosting sustainable investment, promoting green growth, and contributing to the <lb/>Sustainable Development Goals. <lb/>Improve connectivity <lb/>The premise of the Aid for Trade Initiative is that enshrining market access in trade agreements is an <lb/>essential, but not a sufficient step to achieve market presence – other factors need to be addressed too. Past <lb/>Global Reviews have sought to galvanise attention and action on these binding constraints. The <lb/>OECD/WTO Aid for Trade at a Glance (2015) underlines that this strategy is working, but that high trade <lb/>costs remain a significant impediment for developing countries. In the worst cases, prohibitive trade costs <lb/>effectively price the poorest countries out of regional and global markets altogether, leaving them locked <lb/>into low-value regional trade where growth possibilities are stymied. At the factory or farm-gate level, <lb/>products can be competitively priced but still fail in export markets due to excessive trade costs. High trade <lb/>costs also erode consumer welfare, narrowing the range of good and services on offer and pushing up <lb/>prices. While trade costs alone do not fully explain the development pathways of economies, they are a <lb/>major factor in clarifying why some countries are unable to grow and diversify. The same holds also true <lb/>for many regions, often disadvantaged, within countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>Distance is a key determinant of trade costs and a major constraint for exporters. F0r instance, in the <lb/>Pacific region the weighted average distance from major markets is some 11 500 kilometres. Asian <lb/>Development Bank research (2015) on exporters in the Pacific finds that e-commerce substantially reduces <lb/>the physical distance between buyers and sellers. Accelerating the spread of e-commerce through an &quot; Aid <lb/>for eTrade &quot; initiative has been suggested as a way to reduce trade costs and connect SMEs to global <lb/>markets (Suominen, 2015). <lb/>Embedding a trade connectivity and trade cost perspective at the centre of the Aid for Trade Initiative <lb/>would provide an operational focal point for action among a broad collation of stakeholders, including the <lb/>providers of South-South co-operation and the private sector. The advantages of trade connectivity and <lb/>trade cost reduction targets are that they are neutral in the sense of benefiting not just exporters, but also <lb/>importers and households (Hoekman, 2014). Such a focus would also allow for a critical assessment of the <lb/>domestic regulatory framework which often stifles growth of the service sector. <lb/>It should be left to governments in dialogue with stakeholders to identify which costs are most <lb/>distorting, how best to reduce them, and how to use and mix the varied forms of development finance <lb/>available from different providers. Such an action-focused approach would strengthen the accountability <lb/>for outcomes and even allow for the introduction of innovative donor approaches such as cash-on-delivery <lb/>and other forms of impact programming. <lb/>Boost sustainable investment <lb/>As highlighted above, value chains have become a dominant feature of the world economy, involving <lb/>countries at all levels of development, from the poorest to the most advanced. The production of goods and <lb/>services is increasingly carried out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive <lb/>cost and quality. This growing fragmentation of production across borders has important implications for <lb/>trade and investment patterns and offers new prospects for growth, development and jobs. In today&apos;s more <lb/>interconnected world both the costs of trade and investment protectionism and the benefits of multilateral <lb/>opening are much higher than previously thought (OECD/WTO/UNCTAD, 2013). <lb/>The Aid for Trade Initiative and the Trade Facilitation Agreement address the trade side of the <lb/>equation. Sauvant et al. (2015) argue that the creation of sustainable investment facilitation could address <lb/>the other side. Such a programme could tackle a range of issues such as transparency and donor support for <lb/>capacity building in developing countries and in particular the LDCs (i.e. aid for investment). ). Looking <lb/>ahead, one option for the Aid for Trade Initiative would be to increase focus on the links between trade and <lb/>investment. It would build on the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, with transactions falling <lb/>under Mode 3 (i.e. commercial presence) accounting for nearly two-thirds of the world&apos;s FDI stock role. <lb/>The initial emphasis could thus be on investment in services, with a focus on those sectors that are central <lb/>to promoting sustainable development. <lb/>Promote green growth <lb/>Green growth offers developing countries ways to boost development and help reduce poverty in the <lb/>short term while preserving natural assets and raising the potential for economic growth over the long term <lb/>(OECD, 2013b). Aid for trade could play a catalytic role in promoting green growth. An important synergy <lb/>between aid for trade and green growth programmes is the focus on reducing trade and transport costs. <lb/>Increasing efficient use of resources in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves <lb/>competitiveness. Another possible avenue to assist the transition to green growth is through aid-for-trade <lb/>programmes that support trade in environmental goods and services, the development of green <lb/>infrastructure (such as sustainable transport systems, efficient logistics etc.) and strengthen supply chains <lb/>for low carbon technologies. By strengthening economic resilience and supply side capacity of LDCs, aid <lb/>for trade programs also contribute to these countries capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change. <lb/></body>

			<body>The WTO Task Force recognised sustainable development as a guiding principle of aid for trade. It <lb/>recommended that donors strengthen the application of environmental impact assessments as a way of <lb/>safeguarding against possible negative environmental impacts of aid for trade projects. Common <lb/>approaches for &quot; strategic environmental assessment &quot; at the sector and national levels will also help to <lb/>mainstream environmental considerations across aid for trade policies and programs. Keane et al (2009) <lb/>also make the point that, while donors are increasing resources to climate change mitigation and <lb/>adaptation, there need to be standardised checks to ensure compatibility between these programmes and aid <lb/>for trade. Indeed, there is much scope for aid for trade and new sources of climate change finance to work <lb/>together to help meet some of the expected costs of climate change. <lb/>Contribute to delivering the SDGs <lb/>The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) urges the world to transform its natural resource-<lb/>dependent growth pattern to a more inclusive and sustainable one. Trade is an essential means of <lb/>implementation of the sustainable development agenda and aid for trade can play a catalytic role in <lb/>supporting the SDG (Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 2015). Aid for trade is also part of SDG 8 to &quot; Promote <lb/>sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work <lb/>for all &quot; with the objective to &quot; increase aid-for-trade support for developing countries, in particular least <lb/>developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical <lb/>Assistance to Least Developed Countries &quot; (United Nations, 2015). Aid for trade shares many of the <lb/>objectives of the SDGs and if used in a complementary and reinforcing manner, may help build the <lb/>economic resilience and supply-side capacity LDCs need to adapt and mitigate climate change and link to <lb/>the world economy on better terms (Ancharaz and Sultan, 2010). Aid for trade can help developing <lb/>countries build the capacities that in turn can contribute to a healthier environment and to fighting poverty. <lb/>The Sustainable Development Agenda requires a significantly increased amount of financing. This <lb/>will strengthen the prominence of international trade as a source of financing for development, particularly <lb/>for the LDCs. However, the trade and development community should take care that the transformative <lb/>nature of the Post-2015 Development Agenda does not inadvertently give rise to unnecessary non-tariff <lb/>measures that would reduce the capacity of developing countries to use trade as an engine of economic <lb/>growth and poverty reduction. This requires a more integrated approach to ensure that aid for trade <lb/>contributes to inclusive and sustainable development outcomes. That is, in addition to improving trade <lb/>performance, the Initiative should aim more explicitly at positive social, economic and environmental <lb/>impacts. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Much has changed in the trade and development landscape since the Aid for Trade Initiative was <lb/>created ten years ago. Trade and investment flows are increasingly driven by the fragmentation of the <lb/>production process. This offers opportunities for developing countries, but also highlights the need for an <lb/>open, predictable and transparent trade and investment regime. Meanwhile, the development landscape has <lb/>seen the rise of many more providers of South-South co-operation which are giving new impetus to trade-<lb/>promoting development assistance. <lb/>The spread of global value chains, the increasing importance of knowledge-based capital and the rise <lb/>of the digital economy are ushering in the &quot; next production revolution &quot; (OECD, 2015b). Countries, rich <lb/>and poor need to seize this opportunity to harness innovation to boost economic growth and spur job <lb/>creation. It is uncertain however what rise of robotics, 3D printing and reducing carbon foot prints will <lb/>mean for the way in which production and trade are organised -whether they will lead to near-sourcing or <lb/>further dispersion of value chains (Lipson and Kurman, 2013). What is certain is that the trade and <lb/>development community need to consider urgently how possible science and technology-driven <lb/>developments will change the role that trade and investment play in development strategies and in the <lb/>achievement of the SDGs. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Aid for Trade Initiative has achieved much since its inception in 2006. The Initiative has <lb/>succeeded in rekindling awareness among developing countries and donor agencies about the positive role <lb/>that trade can play in promoting economic growth and development. Developing countries are getting <lb/>better at articulating, mainstreaming and communicating their trade-related objectives and strategies. In <lb/>turn, this has had a positive impact on the alignment of donor support with aid for trade flows steadily <lb/>growing since 2005. <lb/>Econometric analysis suggests that aid for trade is broadly associated with improvements in trade <lb/>performance, which in turn is related to reductions in poverty. These effects are confirmed by a growing <lb/>number of studies, using different methods, which yield a strong narrative about the positive impact of aid-<lb/>for-trade programmes. The delivery of aid for trade has been largely effective, but more could be done <lb/>especially through regional approaches, while experimenting with new forms of aid delivery could <lb/>strengthen accountability between donors and partners and help with improving results. <lb/>The success of the Initiative is attributed to the strong partnerships it has formed between the trade <lb/>and development communities. It has brought together various groups of stakeholders, particularly, <lb/>developing countries and donors, with the common aim to make trade work for development. Partnerships <lb/>with the private sector and the providers of South-South co-operation could be strengthened further. <lb/>The Initiative has been flexible enough to adapt to the changing trade and development landscape as <lb/>witness by the focus of successive Aid for Trade at a Glance reports on Maintaining Momentum <lb/>(OECD/WTO, 2009), Showing Results (OECD/WTO, 2011), Connecting to Value Chains (OECD/WTO, <lb/>2013) and most recently Reducing Trade Costs (OECD/WTO, 2015). Highlighting the pivotal role of trade <lb/>for economic growth and poverty reduction remains important, but the Initiative could give more emphasis <lb/>on the need to improve connectivity, boost investment, promote green growth, and play a central role in <lb/>delivering the SDGs. <lb/></body>
