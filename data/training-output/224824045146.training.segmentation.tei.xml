			<body>CELE Exchange 2009/1 <lb/>© OECD 2009 <lb/>By Eamonn Greville, Department of Education and Science, Ireland <lb/>The Department of Education and Science in Ireland has recently drawn up a set of planning and <lb/>design guidelines for learning spaces for pupils with special educational needs in mainstream primary <lb/>and post primary schools. <lb/>The document entitled &quot; Planning &amp; Design Guidelines for Accommodation for Pupils with Special <lb/>Educational Needs in Primary &amp; Post Primary Schools &quot; (Technical Guidance Document 026) will <lb/>shortly be published on the Department&apos;s website at www.education.ie. <lb/>These guidelines offer information on space planning and design for school principals, boards of <lb/>management and designers to make permanent learning facilities available for pupils with special <lb/>educational needs across the 26 counties of Ireland. The guidelines reflect many of the recent changes <lb/>in the country&apos;s educational system, changes that have placed greater demands on schools for additional <lb/>space to account for a growing range of teaching and support services for pupils with autistic spectrum <lb/>disorders, emotional disturbance and/or behaviour problems, speech and language difficulties, hearing <lb/>impairment, visual impairment, multi-sensory impairment, and other needs. <lb/>BackGrounD <lb/>A number of mainstream schools, mainly at primary level, have been providing classrooms for pupils with <lb/>special educational needs for some time, mainly in the area of autistic spectrum disorders; however the <lb/>type and quality of physical infrastructure needed to deliver these classes has often been less than ideal. <lb/>Classrooms at post primary level were less common, though in 1999 the Department helped set up a <lb/>special education facility for teaching up to 15 pupils with a moderate general learning disability in a post <lb/>primary school in County Offaly, Ireland. The project went ahead in 2001, and is today fully operational; <lb/>this has become one of the models of successful integrated special needs provision in the country. <lb/>The focus has now moved towards a more integrated service provision for pupils with special educational <lb/>needs in the mild/moderate spectrum. These guidelines will now, for the first time, establish a clear set of <lb/>physical parameters for schools and designers in providing a suite of learning accommodation for these <lb/>pupils within the mainstream school setting. The Department, working with the Special Educational <lb/>Needs Organiser, will identify suitable schools for this accommodation, based on a set of criteria, and <lb/>will work closely with these schools and their boards of management to establish the special needs <lb/>element and to fund the necessary physical and teaching resources. <lb/>Including Pupils with <lb/>Special Educational Needs <lb/>in Schools in Ireland <lb/></body>

			<body>SpacES <lb/>The spaces can typically be provided either as an extension to an existing mainstream primary or post <lb/>primary school, or as part of a new primary or post primary school design; the surface area totals 470 m² <lb/>for primary schools and 552 m² for post primary schools. The basis is a suite of two general classrooms <lb/>of 70 m² linked by a central activities area. Ancillary spaces include an individual withdrawal room <lb/>off each classroom, fully assisted toileting with a level-entry shower accessible from each classroom, <lb/>a multi-sensory room, a para-educational room, a linen/sluice room, storage, and an office and toilets <lb/>for staff. Outside are a dedicated secure play area (hard and soft play) and a sensory garden, as well as <lb/>additional car parking. <lb/>IncluSIvIty anD flExIBIlIty <lb/>There are two key objectives in meeting the challenges posed by providing for pupils with special <lb/>educational needs. These are inclusivity and flexibility. The Department&apos;s view is that for all new school <lb/>building projects, the spaces for pupils with special educational needs must be appropriately located <lb/>within the design proposal in order to promote and develop inclusivity. All pupils, regardless of ability, <lb/>Special education facility <lb/>for primary schools: <lb/>exemplar floor plan <lb/>(Department of Education <lb/>and Science, Ireland) <lb/>Observation <lb/>screen <lb/>Classroom 1 <lb/>Classroom 2 <lb/>Circulation <lb/>Circulation <lb/>Classroom <lb/>WC&apos;s <lb/>Withdrawal <lb/>room <lb/>Withdrawal <lb/>room <lb/>Store <lb/>Para-educational <lb/>room <lb/>Multi-sensory <lb/>room <lb/>Office <lb/>Circulation <lb/>Circulation <lb/>Circulation <lb/>Staff WC&apos;s <lb/>Linen/sluice <lb/>room <lb/>Central activities space <lb/>Observation <lb/>screen <lb/>© OECD 2009 – ISSN 2072-7925 – CELE Exchange 2009/1 <lb/>Including Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Schools in Ireland <lb/>should be able to enter via the main entrance to the school building on a daily basis and participate in <lb/>their education in an inclusive manner. Locating their spaces in a remote, isolated part of the building <lb/>or in a stand-alone building, where contact and social development opportunities with the main school <lb/>population would be difficult to promote, is not acceptable. <lb/>It is equally important that the layout and quality of the design provides flexibility for the school and <lb/>support staff in adequately supporting its pupils. A typical example would be the classroom layout <lb/>which may change on a regular basis according to daily needs. Fixed partitions and immobile furniture <lb/>are not recommended as they would not offer the required level of flexibility to adapt the space to meet <lb/>the user needs. <lb/>From time to time &quot; reverse inclusion &quot; may take place, i.e. where mainstream pupils are included with <lb/>pupils with special educational needs for curricular activities. Flexibility to adapt the teaching space is <lb/>critical in order to facilitate reverse inclusion and to ensure that the physical layout of the spaces does <lb/>not restrict or hinder the school&apos;s curricular programme. <lb/>DESIGn SolutIonS <lb/>The guidelines deal in some detail with the design considerations which need to be incorporated into <lb/>the physical building structure. The range of special needs is vast and the design solutions should <lb/>accommodate all needs however diverse their requirements. For example, some pupils with autistic <lb/>spectrum disorders can display extreme sensitivity to sensory stimulation: sound, light, colour, smell <lb/>and pattern. It is critical therefore that the building design for these pupils be aimed at reducing <lb/>environmental stimuli through directing attention to the amount and type of visual, aural, tactile and <lb/>olfactory stimulation. Conversely, pupils who have a visual impairment depend greatly on auditory and <lb/>tactile cues within the building, and its design should reflect this need. <lb/>In addition, the drive for inclusion requires the designer to mesh the mainstream spaces and special <lb/>needs elements in a seamless manner both internally and externally. The Department expects schools <lb/>and their design teams to adopt pragmatic, cost effective approaches to ensure the continuum of <lb/>design solutions, particularly in spaces where special educational pupils require regular access to the <lb/>mainstream school (e.g. the general purpose room and circulation areas). Examples of a cost effective <lb/>approach include the use of appropriate colour, floor coverings, control of natural light and shade, <lb/>avoidance of strong patterns and textures, acoustic modification of the internal environment, and high <lb/>frequency light fittings. <lb/>While the guidelines emphasise providing a pleasant educational environment, designers should <lb/>carefully consider the selection of materials and the detailing and design of services to ensure the <lb/>safety of all. Some pupils can become quite distressed and occasionally exhibit challenging behaviour; <lb/>finishes and fittings should eliminate opportunities for self-injury. Guidance is given on the appropriate <lb/>use of floor coverings, wall and ceiling finishes, acoustics, glazing, door ironmongery, daylighting, <lb/>mechanical and electrical services, and furniture and fittings. <lb/>The document also lists typical spaces and their surface areas for primary and post primary schools and <lb/>presents a floor plan of an exemplar scheme which shows the optimum adjacencies and relationship <lb/>between these spaces for a primary school setting. <lb/></body>

			<body>concluSIon <lb/>These guidelines are seen as a further positive step towards integrating pupils with special needs into <lb/>mainstream schooling. They will be enhanced and updated on a regular basis to reflect the changing <lb/>and challenging needs of these pupils and their environment. A number of these accommodation suites <lb/>are already under construction and more are due for completion over the coming years. <lb/>Pupils with severe and profound physical and intellectual disabilities including multiple disabilities <lb/>are not specifically covered by this guidance document. The Department recognises that those pupils <lb/>require intensive care and support in special schools, a number of which exist across the country. Due <lb/>to the specific space and design requirements for that group, the Department will develop separate <lb/>guidance for those schools in the future. <lb/>For more information, contact: <lb/>Eamonn Greville <lb/>Planning &amp; Building Unit <lb/>Department of Education and Science <lb/>Tullamore, Co.
