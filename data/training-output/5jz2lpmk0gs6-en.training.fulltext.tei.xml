			<p>1.<lb/> While innovation-based growth – underpinned by investments in knowledge-based capital<lb/> (KBC) – is central to raising long-term living standards, there are important differences across OECD<lb/> countries in investments in KBC and innovative capacity, which carry important implications for aggregate<lb/> productivity performance (OECD 2010; <ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013</ref>). One possible explanation for these<lb/> patterns at the aggregate level is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries, which provide<lb/> firms in some countries with a greater incentive to innovate. The returns to innovation are partly influenced<lb/> by the ease with which innovative firms can attract sufficient tangible resources to underpin the<lb/> implementation and commercialisation of new ideas, which will in turn reflect the ability of national<lb/> economies to reallocate scarce resources toward the most innovative firms over time. In this context,<lb/> adjustment frictions preventing the (re)allocation of resources towards their most productive use can<lb/> significantly affect aggregate innovation and productivity outcomes (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2013</ref>). 2 Given the<lb/> potential for public policy to affect resource flows (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al.,<lb/> 2013</ref>), this paper explores the extent to which public policies shape the ability of innovative firms to attract<lb/> capital and labour.<lb/></p>

			<p>2.<lb/> This paper draws on an emerging literature from the United States, which utilises firm level<lb/> longitudinal data on firms&apos; patenting activity and performance to examine what happens when firms patent.<lb/> While patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these studies show that patenting tends to be<lb/></p>

The views expressed in the paper are<lb/> those of the authors and do not reflect those of the OECD and its member countries.<lb/> 2<lb/> For example, see Restuccia and Rogerson, (2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 6<lb/> associated with important economic changes within firms (<ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011</ref>) and<lb/> demonstrate strong patterns of reallocation towards patenting firms and away from firms that do not<lb/> innovate (<ref type="biblio">Kogan et al., 2012</ref>). Despite the emergence of this literature, there is very little cross-country<lb/> evidence on patterns of reallocation towards innovative firms. Accordingly, following the approach used<lb/> by <ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011)</ref> for the United States, this paper looks at 23 OECD countries<lb/> over the period 2002-2010 using matched PATSTAT-ORBIS data, with a view to highlight cross-country<lb/> differences in reallocation and innovation patterns. 3 To the best of the authors&apos; knowledge, this paper is the<lb/> first to explore cross-country differences in the extent to which resources flow to patenting firms.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.<lb/> Using this approach, it is possible to replicate a key message from the US studies: namely, that<lb/> patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level. For the average firm in the<lb/> sample, the baseline estimates imply that a 10% increase in the firm patent stock is associated with a 1%<lb/> increase in employment and a 1.3% increase in the capital stock. Moreover, instrumental variables<lb/> estimation – which exploits data on patent litigation within technological fields to instrument patenting –<lb/> suggests that the impact of patenting on firm size is likely to be causal, which is a significant contribution<lb/> to this literature given that existing studies have ignored biases arising from the endogeneity of patenting<lb/> activity. Beyond the direct positive effects of a firm&apos;s own patents, firms will also indirectly benefit from<lb/> patenting of other firms in the same conglomerate, since firm performance measures also respond to the<lb/> patents held by other affiliates within the same group, highlighting the importance of knowledge flows<lb/> within broad organisational structures. Finally, while the baseline results suggest that patenting has a small<lb/> or insignificant impact on productivity – consistent with the US literature – additional analysis suggests<lb/> that the impact of patenting on productivity is realised with a lag. This is consistent with the idea that firms<lb/> typically need to undergo organisational restructuring and attract complementary tangible resources before<lb/> they can fully realise the benefits of new ideas (<ref type="biblio">David and Wright, 2003</ref>).<lb/> 4.<lb/> The analysis also reveals some interesting cross-country patterns, which seem to suggest that<lb/> some countries are more successful than others at reallocating tangible resources to innovative firms. For<lb/> example, the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms in the United States is estimated to be more<lb/> than twice as large as in Italy, and these differences become four-to-five-fold when looking at capital.<lb/> These differences, in turn, motivate an analysis of the role of public policies in shaping the observed<lb/> cross-country differences in resource flows to patenting firms – another key novelty of the paper. While<lb/> further work is required to establish causality – and with the caveat related to the limitations of patenting<lb/> as a measure of innovation – the results are consistent with the idea that well-functioning product, labour<lb/> and capital markets, efficient judicial systems and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise failure can<lb/> raise the expected returns to investing in KBC. These benefits are partly realised through stronger<lb/> competitive pressures and more efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to<lb/> implement and commercialise new ideas and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to<lb/> experiment with uncertain growth opportunities.<lb/> 5.<lb/> More specifically, the results of the econometric analysis provide support for the following policy<lb/> conclusions:<lb/> • Stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with lower resource flows to<lb/> patenting firms, reflecting the idea that stringent EPL raises the cost of reallocating resources.<lb/> The estimated effect of EPL is economically large: a policy reform that reduced the stringency of<lb/> EPL from the highest observed level (Portugal) to the average level (Norway) is estimated to<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 7<lb/> more than double the extent to which labour flows to patenting firms. Additional analysis<lb/> suggests that the burden of stringent EPL falls disproportionately on young firms, which is<lb/> consistent with existing studies showing that stringent EPL reduces the scope for experimentation<lb/> with uncertain technologies.<lb/> • Cumbersome product market regulations (PMR) are negatively associated with employment<lb/> flows to patenting firms, which may reflect the tendency for such regulations to prolong the<lb/> existence of inefficient firms in the market and to raise the cost structure of inputs that are<lb/> required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion. The estimates imply that the<lb/> responsiveness of firm employment to increases in the patent stock would more than double if the<lb/> stringency of PMR was reduced from the highest observed level (Poland) to the sample mean<lb/> value (Belgium). Similarly, more stringent barriers to trade and investment reduce the ability of<lb/> patenting firms to attract capital: all else equal, reducing barriers to trade and investment from the<lb/> most stringent setting (Slovak Republic) to sample average (Japan) is associated with a 70%<lb/> increase in the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms.<lb/> • Bankruptcy legislation that does not excessively penalise business failure can promote the flow<lb/> of resources to more innovative firms by reducing entrepreneurs&apos; expectations that they will be<lb/> heavily penalised in case of failure and thus encouraging them to experiment with risky<lb/> high-return high-failure type technologies. For instance, reducing the cost of bankruptcy<lb/> procedures from the sample maximum (Italy) to the mean value (France) would be associated<lb/> with a 30% increase in the capital flow to patenting firms.<lb/> • In countries with more efficient judicial systems, capital and labour flow more readily to<lb/> patenting firms, consistent with research showing that easier contract enforcement makes it less<lb/> costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to underpin firm growth. All else equal, a policy<lb/> reform that improved the civil justice system in the least efficient country (Czech Republic) to<lb/> the average efficiency in the sample (Switzerland) would be associated with a 50% increase in<lb/> the extent to which capital flows to patenting firms.<lb/> • Resource flows to patenting firms tend to be stronger in countries with more developed financial<lb/> markets, and this effect is particularly important for young firms. Thus, financial systems play an<lb/> important role in helping credit-constrained firms to implement and commercialise new ideas,<lb/> raising the returns to innovation. Similarly, resources flow more freely to young patenting firms<lb/> in countries with more developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital. This suggests<lb/> that seed and early stage venture capital plays an important role for ensuring the growth of young<lb/> patenting firms and the development of radical innovations. For example, all else equal,<lb/> increasing access to early stage venture capital from the lowest level (Greece) to the sample<lb/> average (Belgium) implies that capital flows to patenting firms would be around one-third higher<lb/> than otherwise.<lb/> 6.<lb/> The paper proceeds as follows. The next section places our study in the context of the existing<lb/> literature and discusses the channels through which public policies may influence resource flows to<lb/> innovative firms. Section 3 describes the underlying firm level data used in the analysis and presents some<lb/> preliminary evidence on key economic differences between patenting and non-patenting firms. In<lb/> Section 4, the empirical methodology utilised to estimate resource flows to patenting firms is outlined, as<lb/> well as the approach to identify the impact of public policies on resource flows. Section 5 discusses the<lb/> empirical results and highlights: i) that patenting is likely to cause real changes in economic activity at the<lb/> firm level, both at the intensive and extensive margins; ii) some interesting cross-country differences in the<lb/> extent to which resources flow to patenting firms; iii) that public policies can shape resource flows to<lb/> innovative firms; iv) that these policy effects are stronger in sectors more exposed to the policies; and v)<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 8<lb/> that the burden of some policies fall disproportionately on young firms, which are shown to be key agents<lb/> in the introduction of radical innovations. In Section 6, some robustness tests are performed, while<lb/> Section 7 offers some concluding thoughts.<lb/></p>

			<p>7.<lb/> Cross-country differences in aggregate-level productivity outcomes are increasingly being linked<lb/> to the widespread asymmetry and heterogeneity in firm performance within sectors (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al.,<lb/> 2013; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009</ref>). The distribution of firm productivity is typically not clustered around the<lb/> mean (as would be the case with a normal distribution) but is instead characterised by many below-average<lb/> performers and a smaller number of star performers. Moreover, the degree of heterogeneity is striking:<lb/> even within narrowly defined industries in the United States, firms at the 90th percentile of the TFP<lb/> distribution are twice as productive as firms at the 10th percentile (<ref type="biblio">Syverson, 2004</ref>). 4 These findings<lb/> suggest that the focus on average outcomes is misleading and thus heterogeneous firm models are<lb/> becoming the main analytical workhouse and empirical research is increasingly focusing on the star<lb/> performers which disproportionately drive productivity and job growth (<ref type="biblio">Haltiwanger, 2013; Criscuolo et<lb/> al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> 8.<lb/> Given the tendency for highly productive firms to coexist with low productivity firms within<lb/> narrowly-defined sectors, the recent literature has focused on resource misallocation as a potential<lb/> explanation for why some countries are more productive than others (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2013; Hsieh and<lb/> Klenow, 2009</ref>). A key observation is that in well-functioning economies, a firm&apos;s relative position in the<lb/> productivity and size distributions is positively correlated, which means that on average relatively more<lb/> productive firms should be larger (e.g. static allocative efficiency; see <ref type="biblio">Olley and Pakes, 1996</ref>). Research on<lb/> firm dynamics reveals large cross-country differences in the efficiency of resource allocation, which<lb/> suggests that some economies are more successful at channelling resources to highly productive firms than<lb/> others. For example, in the United States, manufacturing sector labour productivity is 50% higher due to<lb/> the actual allocation of employment across firms, compared to a hypothetical situation where labour is<lb/> uniformly allocated across firms, irrespective of their productivity (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2013</ref>). While a<lb/> similar pattern holds for some countries of Northern Europe such as Sweden, it turns out that static<lb/> allocative efficiency is considerably lower in other OECD economies, particularly those of Southern<lb/> Europe (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2014</ref>).<lb/> 9.<lb/> While there are likely to be many reasons why some countries are more successful than others at<lb/> channelling resources to the most productive firms, static allocative efficiency can only be achieved if<lb/> there is dynamic allocative efficiency that occurs when resources move towards more productive firms at<lb/> the expense of less productive firms over time (<ref type="biblio">Haltiwanger, 2011</ref>). Accordingly, the following section<lb/> discusses empirical evidence on dynamic resource reallocation with a special reference to resource flows to<lb/> patenting firms – the central issue explored in this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1<lb/> A healthy economy reallocates resources to their most productive use<lb/></head>

			<p>10.<lb/> The pace of reallocation of inputs and outputs is generally high in OECD countries: on average,<lb/> about 15-20% of all firms and more than 20% of jobs are created or destroyed each year. 5 This is not to say<lb/> 4<lb/> The same is true with respect to the firm size distribution, with many small firms co-existing with a smaller<lb/> number of very large firms (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> 5<lb/> Over the first-half of the 1990s, firm turnover rates (entry plus exit rates) in OECD countries were in the<lb/> range of 15 to more than 20% in the business sector (see Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta 2004).<lb/> Meanwhile, average annual gross job reallocation – the sum of job creation and job destruction between t–<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 9<lb/> that resource reallocation is always desirable – shifting resources also entails costs for firms, workers and<lb/> governments – and excessive reallocation is no more desirable than the persistent trapping of resources in<lb/> inefficient activities. Nevertheless, continuous reallocation is a key feature of well-functioning market<lb/> economies and aggregate productivity will be improved if resources are reallocated away from less<lb/> productive to more productive businesses and activities over time. The key mechanisms through which this<lb/> process occurs are firm turnover (i.e. entry and exit), shifts in resources across incumbent firms and<lb/> resource reallocation within firms.<lb/></table>

			<p>11.<lb/> Empirical evidence suggests that, over time, resources tend to be reallocated toward more<lb/> productive activities. Most existing studies tend to focus on labour. For instance, while the leading<lb/> cross-country study finds that within-firm improvements in performance account for the majority of<lb/> aggregate labour productivity growth over a five-year window, the contribution from firm entry and exit is<lb/> estimated to reach at least 20% in some OECD countries (the estimates are higher for emerging countries),<lb/> while that from reallocation of labour across existing enterprises is generally small, but positive<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2004; OECD, 2003</ref>). 6 Within-countries studies show the importance of reallocation<lb/> through entry, exit and market share gains by more productive firms via market selection. For example,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Disney et al., (2003)</ref> show that for the United Kingdom this reallocation accounts for more than 80% of<lb/> aggregate total factor productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, while decompositions of labour<lb/> productivity for the Canadian economy as a whole and the United States retail sector yield similar<lb/> conclusions. 7 There is also considerable heterogeneity across firms in their ability to use capital<lb/> productively and existing studies show that capital – as measured by acquisitions of property, plant and<lb/> equipment – also tends to flow from less productive firms to more productive firms (<ref type="biblio">Eisfeldt and Rampini,<lb/> 2006; Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2002</ref>).<lb/> 12.<lb/> Recent evidence suggests that resources flow towards firms that patent at the expense of non-<lb/>patenting firms. Studies exploiting firm level longitudinal data from the United States suggest that<lb/> patenting – also a proxy for innovation – tends to be associated with important changes within firms, e.g.,<lb/> increases in firm size, scope, and skill and capital intensity observed after firms patent (see<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011</ref>). With respect to the intensive margin (i.e. differences amongst<lb/> patenting firms), a 10% increase in patent stock is associated with about a 1.5% increase in value added, a<lb/> 1.7% increase in capital stock, and a 1.4% increase in employment over the sample period 1975 to 1997.<lb/> The impact of patenting on total factor productivity (TFP), however, tends to be small or insignificant. This<lb/> may reflect the possibility that new ideas – as proxied by increases in the patent stock – take a longer time<lb/> to affect productivity, since firms typically need to undertake organisational restructuring (<ref type="biblio">Bloom and Van<lb/> Reenen, 2010; David and Wright, 2003; Pozzi and Schivardi, 2012</ref>) and attract complementary tangible<lb/> resources in order to implement and commercialise new ideas (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013</ref>). 8<lb/> 1 and t – was about 22% of dependent employment in the business sector between 1997 and 2004 (see<lb/> OECD, 2009a)<lb/> 6<lb/> These estimates are likely to understate the contribution of reallocation since the direct contribution of net<lb/> entry is reinforced by an indirect effect whereby incumbents raise their own productivity to maintain<lb/> market share in the face of strong entry pressures (see <ref type="biblio">Aghion, et al., 2007</ref>). And, the contribution from<lb/> reallocation – particularly net entry – tends to increase when the analysis is conducted over longer time<lb/> horizons (<ref type="biblio">Foster et al., 2001; Bartelsman et al., 2004</ref>).<lb/> 7<lb/> Baldwin and Gu (2006) for Canada find that this reallocation accounts for about 70% of aggregate labour<lb/> productivity growth. Foster et al. (2006) find that entry and exit explain almost all labour productivity<lb/> growth of the US retail sector.<lb/> 8<lb/> This lagged response of TFP may also reflect the fact that the patent stock is based on the year of<lb/> application as opposed to the year in which the patent is ultimately granted.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 10<lb/> 13.<lb/> Since the model controls for industry specific year fixed</table>

			<p>effects, these elasticities provide an<lb/> estimate of the extent to which patenting is associated with higher activity at the firm level, relative to the<lb/> average firm in the sector in a particular year, and are thus informative from a reallocation perspective.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011)</ref> also explore the extensive margin by analysing how firms&apos;<lb/> economic characteristics change when they switch status from being a non-patentee to a patentee. Using an<lb/> event study and a matching estimator, they find that first-time patentees record significant growth along a<lb/> range of firm economic indicators relative to a control group of non-patenting firms that displayed similar<lb/> pre-treatment characteristics.<lb/> 14.<lb/> Looking at all factors of production, Kogan et al., (2012) find strong patterns of reallocation<lb/> towards innovating firms (the extent of which is determined by the stock market response to news about<lb/> patents), and away from firms that do not innovate as proxied by patenting activity. For instance, an<lb/> increase in patenting by a firm from the 50th to the 90th percentile of the innovation distribution increases<lb/> a firm&apos;s physical capital investment rate by 0.4-0.9 percentage points, which is economically significant<lb/> given the sample median firm investment rate of 10% (see column 1 from <ref type="table">Table below</ref>). Moreover, for<lb/> firms that do not innovate, a one standard deviation increase in the level of innovation by a firm&apos;s<lb/> competitor triggers a decline of 1.2-1.6 percentage points in that firm&apos;s investment rate. Innovation also<lb/> triggers similar patterns of reallocation for both labour and financial capital (columns 2 and 3), and similar<lb/> patterns have also been identified using data for Denmark (Lentz and Mortensen 2008).<lb/></p>

			<head>Table 1. Innovation and reallocation in the United States<lb/></head>

			<p>Notes: To estimate the economic magnitude of firm-level technological innovations, <ref type="biblio">Kogan et al., (2012)</ref> use stock market responses<lb/> to news about patents over the period 1926-2007. Net capital inflows are calculated as: debt issuance plus equity issuance minus<lb/> payout (and are normalised by assets).<lb/> Source: <ref type="biblio">Kogan et al., (2012).<lb/></ref> 15.<lb/> Before proceeding, it is important to note that while the results from both aforementioned studies<lb/> demonstrate the important relationship between patenting and firm size, the authors are careful not to<lb/> attach a causal interpretation to their findings. One specific concern is that increases in – latent or explicit –<lb/> demand for certain products might spur growth in both patenting and firm size in some firms but not<lb/> others. 9 As discussed in Section 4.1.3, there are also likely to be other sources of endogeneity and to the<lb/> best of our knowledge, few – if any – papers in the literature control for such biases. Accordingly, a key<lb/> contribution of this paper is to present instrumental variables estimates of the impact of patenting on firm<lb/> size.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 11<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> The links between reallocation and innovation<lb/></head>

			<p>16.<lb/> Despite the emergence of this US literature, cross-country evidence on the extent to which<lb/> patenting firms can attract labour and capital is scarce. More systematic cross-country evidence on<lb/> resource flows to innovative firms is clearly desirable, particularly in light of the close links between<lb/> investments in knowledge-based capital (KBC) and innovation and reallocation mechanisms (see <ref type="biblio">Andrews<lb/> and Criscuolo, 2013</ref>).<lb/> 17.<lb/> Recent research demonstrates the growing importance of KBC as a potential source of<lb/> productivity gains, and the contribution of efficient resource allocation to this process. Indeed, the non-<lb/>rivalrous nature of knowledge means that the initial cost incurred in developing new ideas – typically<lb/> through R&amp;D – does not get re-incurred as the latter are combined with other inputs in the production of<lb/> goods or services. This gives rise to increasing returns to scale – the important property that makes ideas<lb/> and knowledge an engine of growth (<ref type="biblio">Jones, 2005</ref>). Realising this growth potential, however, depends on<lb/> the ability to reallocate labour and capital to their most productive use.<lb/> 18.<lb/> Andrews and de Serres (2012) explore these ideas from the perspective of an intangible-based<lb/> start-up firm, where profitability depends not only on technological success but crucially on the ability to<lb/> leverage the fixed cost of investments in intangibles – which are subject to strong returns to scale – through<lb/> increases in the scale of production (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman and Groot, 2004</ref>). The ability to rapidly reallocate tangible<lb/> resources, such as labour and physical capital, in order to capture the value of the investment before<lb/> imitation by followers is therefore crucial for such firms. Likewise, in the event of technological failure, it<lb/> is vital that firms experimenting with innovative activities can rapidly scale down operations to facilitate<lb/> exit and thereby release resources that can be used by other firms. 10<lb/> 19.<lb/> In fact, it is increasingly being recognised that the growth potential of innovative firms is<lb/> inversely related to the amount of resources that are absorbed by other less productive firms. In a<lb/> heterogeneous firm model calibrated to US data, <ref type="biblio">Acemoglu et al., (2013)</ref> show that policy intervention<lb/> such as R&amp;D tax subsidies are only truly effective when policy-makers can encourage the exit of &quot; low-<lb/>type &quot; incumbent firms, in order to free-up R&amp;D resources (i.e. skilled labour) for innovative &quot; high-type &quot;<lb/> incumbents and entrants. This reflects the idea that low-type firms – despite their lack of innovativeness –<lb/> still employ skilled labour to cover the fixed costs of operation, such as management and back-office<lb/> operations. One implication is that a R&amp;D subsidy will be fully capitalised into the high skilled wage rate –<lb/> without a concomitant rise in innovation output (as suggested by <ref type="biblio">Goolsbee, 1998</ref>) – unless the effective<lb/> supply of high skilled labour can rise to meet additional demand via the downsizing and/or exit of &quot; low-<lb/>type &quot; firms.<lb/> 20.<lb/> Finally, the ability to rapidly redeploy tangible resources not only influences the returns to<lb/> innovation but also the type of strategy firms employ to boost their own productivity, which will be shaped<lb/> by their perceptions of the expected costs of implementing and commercialising new ideas and the ability<lb/> to capitalise on the expected benefits. If the costs of reallocation are deemed to be too high, entrepreneurs<lb/> may have to focus on incremental innovations, rather than experiment with disruptive technologies,<lb/> because it will be more difficult to realise the benefits of risky technologies when successful and contain<lb/> losses when unsuccessful (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman, 2004</ref>). In turn, some entrepreneurs might decide not to even enter<lb/> the market as it might not be profitable or sustainable to enter with just an incremental innovation (<ref type="biblio">Shane,<lb/> 2001; Bhide, 2000</ref>). Hence, the extent of specialisation in sectors that rely more on reallocation – such as<lb/> 10<lb/> This process is also necessary to provide the entrepreneur with sufficient space in order to experiment with<lb/> alternative ideas. Indeed, this is consistent with anecdotal evidence that suggests that the most successful<lb/> entrepreneurs have experienced some form of business failure in the past.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 12<lb/> more innovative or ICT-intensive sectors – may vary across countries (<ref type="biblio">Bartelsman et al., 2010</ref>), partly as a<lb/> result of the efficiency of reallocation mechanisms. In sum, efficient reallocation mechanisms are likely to<lb/> be particularly important for patenting firms to the extent that they shape the returns to innovation but also<lb/> determine the feasibility of various innovation strategies.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3<lb/> Public policy and resource flows to innovative firms<lb/></head>

			<p>21.<lb/> Emerging empirical evidence suggests that public policies can have important effects on the<lb/> efficiency of resource allocation (<ref type="biblio">Arnold et al., 2011; Bartelsman et al., 2013; Andrews and Cingano,<lb/> 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013</ref>). Andrews and Cingano (2014) construct estimates of static allocative<lb/> efficiency at the industry level for a large sample of OECD countries, and show that more stringent<lb/> regulations affecting product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that excessively penalise business<lb/> failure are associated with less efficient resource allocation. Similarly, <ref type="biblio">Bravo-Biosca et al., (2013)</ref> show<lb/> that these policy settings as well as less developed financial markets tend to be associated with a less<lb/> dynamic distribution of firm employment in a small sample of OECD countries, while <ref type="biblio">Aghion et al.,<lb/> (2007)</ref> highlight the importance of financial development for post-entry employment growth. These<lb/> papers, however, are unable to address the question of how policies shape the growth prospects of the most<lb/> innovative firms, since they aggregate firm level data to the sectoral level.<lb/> 22.<lb/> With this background in mind, the strength of the link between resource flows to patenting firms<lb/> and relevant policy and institutional factors is explored, with a specific focus on:<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 13<lb/> • Judicial efficiency: Legal systems that clearly assign and protect property rights and robust public<lb/> institutions that provide a strong rule of law and contain corruption can support efficient resource<lb/> allocation (<ref type="biblio">Haltiwanger, 2011</ref>) and raise the returns to innovation.<lb/> • Financial market development: a range of studies demonstrate the importance of financial<lb/> markets for the efficiency of reallocation and innovative firms more generally (<ref type="biblio">Aghion et al.,<lb/> 2005</ref>). For example, deeper financial systems can underpin the post-entry growth of successful<lb/> firms (<ref type="biblio">Aghion et al., 2007</ref>) and are associated with a more dynamic distribution of firm growth<lb/> (i.e. more growing and shrinking firms and fewer static firms) in industries that are highly<lb/> dependent on external financing (<ref type="biblio">Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> • Seed and early stage venture capital: A key barrier to the growth of many KBC-based start-up<lb/> firms is the inability to obtain external finance, due to difficulties in collateralising KBC. In some<lb/> countries, the financing gap of young entrepreneurial firms is partly bridged by highly-<lb/>specialised financial intermediaries such as venture capitalists or business angels, who address<lb/> informational asymmetries by intensively scrutinising firms before providing capital and<lb/> monitoring them afterwards (<ref type="biblio">Hall and Lerner, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.<lb/> Data<lb/> 3.1<lb/> Firm level data<lb/></head>

			<p>23.<lb/> The empirical analysis is based on two large micro level databases. The first one is the EPO<lb/> Worldwide Patent Statistics Database (PATSTAT), containing detailed information on patent applications<lb/> for over 80 patent offices. The second one is the firm-level commercial database ORBIS, developed by<lb/> Bureau Van Dijk. This paper benefits from valuable additional elaboration on both datasets. These are the<lb/> HAN database, providing a sophisticated matching of patent applicants in PATSTAT with companies in<lb/> ORBIS based on string similarity; and the harmonised firm level dataset based on ORBIS, developed by<lb/> Gal (2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013).<lb/> 24.<lb/> While patenting activity – as a proxy for innovation – carries the advantage of being relatively<lb/> easy to measure and comparable across countries, it entails only a specific component of firms&apos; innovation<lb/> activity. Firms also employ a range of different strategies to manage and protect their intellectual assets,<lb/> either as an alternative or as a complement to formal intellectual property (IP) rights. These include<lb/> secrecy, confidentiality agreements, lead-time, complexity of design, the incorporation of specialist know-<lb/>how and open source methods (OECD, 2011). However, reliable data on these alternative IP strategies and<lb/> related assets at the firm level are unavailable. At the same time, while patents sometimes are filed for or<lb/> acquired for strategic reasons that are unrelated to technological innovation, restricting the empirical<lb/> analysis to companies with 20 employees or more minimises the risk that so-called &quot; patent trolls &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Bessen<lb/> et al., 2011</ref>) are included in the sample.<lb/> 25.<lb/> Furthermore, there is now large and consolidated evidence supporting the role of patent statistics<lb/> as a meaningful indicator of innovative activity at the firm level (see <ref type="biblio">Nagaoka et al., 2010, and Hall and<lb/> Harhoff, 2012</ref>, for recent surveys). Since <ref type="biblio">Pakes and Griliches (1980)</ref>, a number of papers proved the<lb/> existence of a robust correlation between R&amp;D activity and patenting (see <ref type="biblio">Griliches, 1990</ref>, for a survey).<lb/> More recently, survey evidence shows that 55% of new products are patented in Japan while the<lb/> corresponding figure for the United States is 60% (<ref type="biblio">Goto and Nagata, 1997</ref>). Accordingly, this paper<lb/> focuses on patents to proxy the innovative capacity of the firm, but the above caveats should be kept in<lb/> mind when interpreting the policy conclusions arising from the analysis.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 14<lb/> 26.<lb/> Other firm-level variables come from the ORBIS database. Along with many advantages, this<lb/> commercial dataset also carries a number of caveats. First</figure>

			<p>, there is evidence that ORBIS is not necessarily<lb/> representative of the underlying business population within a country, and that coverage varies over<lb/> countries and time without any clear patterns (see <ref type="biblio">Bravo-Biosca et al., 2012</ref>). This in turn introduces an<lb/> important selection bias in our estimates. The required assumption for our estimates to hold is that<lb/> patenting intensity does not affect the probability of being selected into the sample, conditional on firm<lb/> fixed effects and on the wide set of sector*year*country fixed effects included in the main regressions. In<lb/> other words, this requires that companies that change their patent stock to a similar extent are equally<lb/> likely to be, or not to be, included in the sample, within the same country, sector, and year. There is not a<lb/> direct way to test this assumption, but it appears reasonably plausible, since other factors that are<lb/> controlled for in the analysis – e.g. age – are more likely to explain selection.<lb/> 27.<lb/> Secondly, when looking at the matched ORBIS-PATSTAT database, the sophistication and<lb/> accuracy of the matching technique might not be sufficient to rule out the possibility of some measurement<lb/> error in the patent stock variable assigned to ORBIS firms (e.g. as the probabilistic matching may lead to<lb/> some &quot; false negative &quot; or &quot; false positive &quot; patent assignments). To the extent that these errors are<lb/> uncorrelated with firm performance, the matching errors lead to random measurement error, attenuating<lb/> estimates of the effect of patenting on firm performance toward zero.<lb/> 28.<lb/> The resulting dataset is a large cross-country firm-level dataset covering 23 countries.<lb/> Information on firms&apos; accounts from ORBIS starts in 1998, but coverage increases significantly since<lb/> 2003; the analysis therefore starts in that year, as pre-2002 information is likely to be affected by a stronger<lb/> selection bias (see <ref type="table">Table B1</ref> for country coverage). Patent information was retrieved since the year 1980,<lb/> which allows us to build the firms&apos; patent history over the longer time period. For the analysis, the sample<lb/> is restricted to companies with 20 or more employees at the start of the sample, if they are reported already,<lb/> or at the time they appear for the first time. This is preferable to using average employment over the period<lb/> as the latter criterion may lead to selection issues and amplify the impact of successful entrants.<lb/> 29.<lb/> In order to avoid double counting, balance sheet information from ORBIS is restricted to<lb/> unconsolidated accounts; for a detailed description of consolidation and related issues in ORBIS see Gal<lb/> (2013) and Gonnard and Ragoussis (2013). However, it is worth noting that many patent applications are<lb/> filed at the group level and are officially assigned to the headquarter company, which implies that they<lb/> may be excluded from the analysis, given that consolidated accounts are dropped. Thus, it becomes<lb/> important to also account for patents at the level of the group. While ownership information is only<lb/> partially reported in ORBIS, many of the missing links can be logically inferred from reported links (for<lb/> example, if the ownership link of firm C with firm A is missing, this could be inferred if we know that firm<lb/> A owns firm B, and that firm B owns firm C). Appendix A describes the methodology used to develop an<lb/> ad-hoc algorithm which iteratively exploits available information to reconstruct the ownership tree of each<lb/> company. In this way, it was possible to create a group identifier linking companies belonging to the same<lb/> group and to calculate the group-level patent stock.<lb/> 30.<lb/> The measure of patent stock is based on the number of (eventually granted) patent applications to<lb/> the three main patent offices: the USTPO, the EPO, and the WIPO. Robustness tests were performed such<lb/> as including patents from other important national patent offices for which reliable information is available<lb/> (i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). The year of reference is the<lb/> application year. The patent stock is calculated as the cumulative sum of the depreciated yearly patent<lb/> count since 1980. The depreciation rate is the one most frequently used in the literature, equal to 15% per<lb/> year (<ref type="biblio">Hall et al., 2005</ref>). Different patent applications, however, can arise from the same &quot; inventive steps &quot; ,<lb/> as companies may seek protection for the same ideas in many countries by filing the same patent at several<lb/> patent offices. All patent applications referring to the same &quot; priority &quot; patent are defined as a &quot; patent<lb/> family &quot; . In order to take this issue into account, the company-level patent stock is also estimated based on<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 15<lb/> the count of distinct patent families, rather than distinct patents; the International Patent Documentation<lb/> Centre (INPADOC) family definition has been adopted.<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Preliminary evidence<lb/></head>

			<p>31.<lb/> This section presents some descriptive statistics drawn from our dataset. All in all, figures tend to<lb/> confirm three key stylised facts that have emerged from the literature: i) only a small percentage of firms<lb/> patent; ii) these firms are often concentrated in a few key sectors; and iii) on average, patenting firms are<lb/> very different with respect to their non-patenting counterparts, especially in terms of size, but also<lb/> productivity. It is worth stressing that these aggregate statistics are only suggestive and should be<lb/> interpreted with caution, as they might be prone to selection bias (see discussion in section 3<ref type="figure">.1</ref> on the<lb/> limitations of ORBIS) and because the sample excludes firms with less than 20 employees. Finally, the<lb/> descriptive statistics in this section are limited to countries for which a significant number of patenting<lb/> firms over the 2003-2010 period is reported in the dataset, which corresponds to a total of around<lb/> 2.8 million firms across 13 countries.<lb/> 32.<lb/> The left panel of Figure 1 reports the share of firms that own at least one patent in 2009 by<lb/> country. While the share of firms that patent is close to or above 20% in United States and Germany, this<lb/> figure is around 5% for most other countries in Figure 1. The right panel reports the corresponding statistic<lb/> by (NACE Rev. 1.1) 2-digit sectors. The graph shows that there is also large heterogeneity across sectors,<lb/> with manufacturing of chemicals – including pharmaceuticals – (NACE 24), machinery and equipment<lb/> (NACE 29), and electrical and optical (NACE 30-33) showing as expected the largest patenting rates, all<lb/> reporting a share of patenting firms of around 20%. Another stylised fact is that industries in<lb/> manufacturing generally show a much higher patenting rate than in the service sector.<lb/> Figure 1. Share of firms that patent by country and by 2-digit sector<lb/> Selected OECD countries<lb/> Panel A: Country<lb/> Panel B: Industry<lb/> Note: the sample is limited to companies and that have at least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the<lb/> dataset and to countries for which at least 500 firms applied for a patent over the 2003-2010 period.<lb/> Source: PATSTAT, OECD HAN Database, and OECD ORBIS.<lb/></figure>

			<p>33.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports some summary statistics comparing the group of patenting firms with non-<lb/>patentees. Patentees are systematically larger than non-patentees, irrespectively of the indicator used which<lb/> is consistent with existing research from the United States (<ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan, 2011</ref>): on<lb/> average, comparing the simple means of the size variables (columns 1 and 4), turnover is larger by a factor<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 16<lb/> of 4; capital stock by a factor of 5; and employment by a factor of roughly 3. 13 Not surprisingly, patenting<lb/> firms are also more capital intensive and show a higher level of labour productivity than non-patentees. 14<lb/> Table 2. Mean firm characteristics: patentees versus non-patentees<lb/> Selected OECD countries, 2003-2010<lb/></figure>

			<p>Notes: The sample is limited to firms that are observed at least once in the ORBIS database between 2003 and 2010 and that have at<lb/> least 20 employees in 2003 or at the time of their first appearance in the dataset. Patentees are defined as companies that have had<lb/> at least one patent granted from the USTPO, the EPO, the WIPO, or other important national patent offices for which reliable<lb/> information is available (i.e. the British, Canadian, German, French, and Japanese patent offices). *** denotes statistical significance<lb/> at the 1% level.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> Empirical methodology<lb/> 4.1<lb/> Patent stock and firm size<lb/></head>

			<p>34.<lb/> To understand whether these cross-sectional differences between patenting and non-patenting<lb/> firms reflect self-selection on pre-existing differences, the longitudinal structure of the database is<lb/> exploited to explore how changes in firms&apos; patenting status over time are associated with changes in firms&apos;<lb/> characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.1<lb/> The baseline model<lb/></head>

			<p>35.<lb/> Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), the within-firm elasticity of firm<lb/> characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically, deviations<lb/> from firm-average – in the patent stock is estimated, based on the following fixed effects regression<lb/> specification:<lb/></p>

				<formula>isct<lb/> sct<lb/> i<lb/> isct<lb/> isct<lb/> PatS<lb/> Y<lb/> ε<lb/> µ<lb/> η<lb/> β<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> =<lb/> )<lb/> ln(<lb/> ln<lb/> 1<lb/> [1</formula>

			<table>]<lb/> 13<lb/> These variables are logarithms of the original values, and hence the factor, say, for employment is<lb/> computed as e1.034 = 2.8.<lb/> 14<lb/> Note that 4,524 observations with zero real capital stock are excluded from the fixed assets statistics. The<lb/> real capital stock is calculated using the perpetual inventory method. See Gal (2013) for detail.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 17<lb/> where Y is the economic characteristic (employment, capital, turnover) for firm i, in sector s, in country c<lb/> at time t and PatS is the depreciated patent stock. The specification also includes firm fixed effects and<lb/> industry*country*year fixed effects. As a robustness test and to explore longer run impacts, we also<lb/> estimated equation (1) in long difference form – i.e., on a cross-sectional dataset formed by the 2009-2003<lb/> difference of all variables.<lb/></table>

			<p>36.<lb/> Since the log-log specification would exclude all firms that have zero patents, in order to include<lb/> in the sample observations with PatS equal to zero, the standard technique of taking the logarithm of<lb/> 1+PatS is applied; this implies that we cannot strictly interpret the estimated coefficients as elasticities.<lb/> Since this may introduce a non-negligible bias, additional robustness tests show that the sign and the<lb/> magnitude of the results do not change when firms with no patents are excluded (see <ref type="table">Table B2</ref>, Panel A).<lb/> The inclusion of zeros also implies that the estimated coefficient from equation <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> is a joint estimate of the<lb/> extensive (i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee to patentee status) and intensive<lb/> (i.e. differences amongst patenting firms) margin and thus motivates an exploration of the extensive<lb/> margin through an event study methodology, as outlined in Section 4.1.2.<lb/> 37.<lb/> Two different PatS variables are included in the regression in turn – patent applications to<lb/> national offices and applications to the three most important patent offices (EPO, USTPO, and<lb/> WIPO/PCT) but the results are not particularly sensitive to this choice. The latter group of patents is<lb/> defined as &quot; regional &quot; patents. Only applications which are eventually granted are considered. The<lb/> coefficient β is the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics (e.g. employment) to the patent stock.<lb/> Although technically β does not correspond to the elasticity due to the transformation described above, the<lb/> size of the coefficient can be approximately interpreted as such. If β&gt;0, increases in the stock of patents are<lb/> associated with increases in firm employment, relative to the country-industry-year average. While this<lb/> provides an indicator of the extent to which resources flow to more innovative firms, the estimated effect<lb/> will also reflect other factors, including the quality of the underlying idea that is patented and the<lb/> characteristics of the national patenting system. Finally, in Section 5.1.1, we introduce another measure of<lb/> patent stock based on the patent portfolio of the group the company belongs to, since firms belonging to<lb/> the same group may access the patent stock – and the knowledge base – of other affiliated firms<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.2<lb/> The extensive margin<lb/></head>

			<p>38.<lb/> As a complement to the baseline results, a propensity score matching exercise aimed at exploring<lb/> the extensive margin effect of patenting – i.e. what happens to firms when they switch from non-patentee<lb/> to patentee status – is also performed in Section 5.1.2. The analysis is limited to the 4308 firms that apply<lb/> for a patent for the first time in the middle years of the database, i.e. 2005 and 2006, in order to balance the<lb/> pre-and post-treatment observation years.<lb/> 39.<lb/> Following Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011), every patentee is matched with the &quot; most<lb/> similar &quot; non-patentee, which results in a sample of 8616 firms (i.e. 4308 patenting firms and 4308 &quot; nearest<lb/> neighbour &quot; non-patenting firms). The &quot; nearest neighbour &quot; non-patentee is the firm with the closest &quot; patent<lb/> propensity &quot; score, that is, the probability of being a first-time patentee. 15 The propensity score is estimated<lb/> in the years the patenting firms apply for their first patent via a cross-sectional Probit regression of the<lb/> first-patent dummy on one-year lagged employment, capital, and turnover (as in equation 2a):<lb/></p>

				<formula>t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> t<lb/> i<lb/> Turnover<lb/> Capital<lb/> Empl<lb/> patent<lb/> first<lb/> [2b]<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where PatDummy is a binary variable equal to one for patenting firms, γ is a fixed effect for each matched<lb/> patentee/non patentee pair, and τ is a year fixed effect. The inclusion of the patentee/non patentee pair<lb/> fixed effect (γ) implies that the model only exploits variation between the two matched firms. Index is a set<lb/> of 9 dummy variables which are equal to one in the n th year before or after the patentee&apos;s patent is applied<lb/> for, with n=(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Note that n is equal to 0 in the year the patent is applied for. These<lb/> nine dummies take the same values for both patentees and non-patentees and control for time trends around<lb/> the year of first patenting. Finally, the first term on the right-hand side of the equation – i.e. the interaction<lb/> of the index dummies with the patentee dummy – are &quot; switched on &quot; only for patentees. Thus, β 1j – the<lb/> main coefficients of interest – allow for different trends in the outcome variables both before and after the<lb/> first patent is applied for. If, as it is the case in the estimates presented, the β 1j coefficients are significantly<lb/> different from zero only for non-negative n, i.e. only from the year of application onward, on&gt;0 this will<lb/> confirm that significant patentee/non-patentee differences emerge only after the first patent has been<lb/> applied for.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.3<lb/> Instrumental variables estimation<lb/></head>

			<p>41.<lb/> The baseline econometric model outlined in Section 4.1.1 quantifies the within-firm sensitivity<lb/> of firm characteristics (e.g. employment, capital, etc.) with respect to changes – or more specifically,<lb/> deviations from firm-average – in the patent stock, conditional on a wide set of time variant country-<lb/>industry dummies. However, this approach does not necessarily provide a causal estimate of the effect of<lb/> patenting on firm size to the extent that the positive association might reflect the positive impact of<lb/> unobservable or omitted factors on both patenting and firm size. For example, firms that are endowed with<lb/> a more skilled workforce or have better management might patent more, and at the same time grow more<lb/> for reasons independent from their patenting activity. Moreover, a reverse causality channel can also be in<lb/> place: firms that manage to attract more resources for reasons which are unrelated to patenting might be<lb/> able to funnel some of these resources into their patenting activity.<lb/> 42.<lb/> Controlling for these potential sources of endogeneity requires an instrumental variable that is<lb/> correlated with changes in firms&apos; patenting activity, but does not affect firm growth beyond its impact on<lb/> patenting. A potentially promising approach to instrument firms&apos; depreciated patent stock is to exploit<lb/> yearly data on patent litigation in different technology fields. The working hypothesis underlying this<lb/> approach is that the likelihood of patent litigation in the technological fields in which a firm specialises<lb/> may negatively influence the firm&apos;s propensity to patent, since it might proxy for the expected exposure of<lb/> a patent in that field to litigation and its associated costs. For an instrument to be valid, it has to be both<lb/> relevant and exogenous.<lb/> 43.<lb/> In this case, the validity builds on the interplay between two factors: firms&apos; technological inertia<lb/> and the non-negligible time variation in litigation cases across different technologies. More specifically,<lb/> firms tend to exhibit a fair degree of inertia in their technological specialization. Even if the environment in<lb/> which they operate becomes significantly less profitable, it is generally not easy or cost-efficient to start<lb/> innovating and patenting in different technological fields. At the same time, both data (see <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> B1 in<lb/> Appendix B) and anecdotal evidence suggest that patent litigation has shown significantly different time<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 19<lb/> patterns across technologies in the last decade, with some technological classes experiencing sudden bursts<lb/> in the number of litigation cases and others showing a more linear pattern. As a consequence of the<lb/> interaction of those two factors – the technological inertia and the significant time variation in litigation<lb/> across fields – some firms exogenously find their prospective patent portfolio potentially more exposed to<lb/> litigation risks, which in turn decreases their incentives to develop new patents. The exogeneity assumption<lb/> also requires that changes in litigation propensity do not affect changes in firm&apos;s employment and capital<lb/> through other channels conditional on country-year and industry-year dummies – an assumption that seems<lb/> plausible.<lb/></figure>

			<p>44.<lb/> Therefore, we develop a two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation strategy, where in the first<lb/> stage we regress the firm&apos;s patent stock on a firm-specific, time-variant measure of litigation propensity,<lb/> which is our instrumental variable. Operationally, the instrument for firm i at time t is defined as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>񮽙񮽙 񮽙񮽙 = ∑ ℎ * _____ 񮽙񮽙<lb/> 񮽙<lb/> [3]<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where:<lb/> • share is the share of patents in each 4-digit IPC class k within the firm&apos;s patent portfolio applied<lb/> for before the start of the period of analysis. As most patents are allocated to more than one IPC<lb/> class, the share is calculated on patent fractional count, where each patent is weighted 1/N, where<lb/> N is the total number of IPC classes the patent is classified in.</p>

			<figure>For those companies not patenting<lb/> before 2003 (around 10% of the sample), we build the IPC shares based on patents applied for in<lb/> the first year of the firm&apos;s patenting activity in which at least 3 different IPC classes appear in the<lb/> PATSTAT dataset.<lb/> • Litig_prop is the sum of all patents litigated in a given year, divided by the stock of patents<lb/> applied for in the same years. For example, if in year 2005 the data show that 20 patents have<lb/> been litigated, of which 10 have been applied for in 1995 and 10 in 2000, and the total number of<lb/> patents applied for in 1995 and 2000 is 50 and 100, respectively, the value of Litig_prop for the<lb/> year 2005 would be equal to 10/50+10/100=3/10.<lb/> 45.<lb/> Litigation data are sourced from a commercial database created and maintained by Darts-IP. 16 To<lb/> the best of our knowledge, the dataset was first used and described by van Zeerbroeck and Graham (2011).<lb/> Figure B1 (see Appendix B) illustrates the time trends in litigations over the period 2003-2009 for the top<lb/> 10% IPC 4-digit classes and clearly demonstrates that there is a significant variation over time in litigation<lb/> events within technological classes.<lb/> 16<lb/> The Darts-IP dataset covers judgments across different Court levels (first instance, appeal</figure>

			<p>, Supreme Court),<lb/> based on manual collection in courts. As a consequence, the unit of observation is the court decision, not<lb/> the case filing; in some countries some cases may be dropped before reaching a judgement, so the number<lb/> of court decisions can be lower than the (unobserved) number of patent suit filings. According to the data<lb/> provider, the coverage is not universal: while in bigger countries like US, France and UK the coverage is<lb/> close to 100% of the decisions, in other countries it reaches the 70-80%, and increases over time.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 20<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2<lb/> Identifying the role of public policies<lb/> 4.2.1<lb/> The baseline model<lb/></head>

			<p>46.<lb/> The role of policies in explaining the observed cross-country differences in the magnitude of<lb/> these flows is explored by introducing interaction terms between the firm-level patent stock and framework<lb/> policies (see equation 3). The quantitative indicators, sourced from the OECD and other agencies (see<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> for a description), are used to proxy the stance of various framework policies.<lb/></p>

				<formula>isct<lb/> sct<lb/> i<lb/> j<lb/> ct<lb/> isct<lb/> j<lb/> j<lb/> isct<lb/> isct<lb/> P<lb/> PatS<lb/> PatS<lb/> Y<lb/> ε<lb/> µ<lb/> η<lb/> β<lb/> β<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> +<lb/> =<lb/> ∑<lb/> *<lb/> )<lb/> ln(<lb/> )<lb/> ln(<lb/> ln<lb/> 2<lb/> 1<lb/> [3]<lb/></formula>

			<p>where P refers to various framework policies (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>), which are first included in the regression<lb/> separately. For ease of interpretation, each policy variable (i.e. P) is re-scaled to equal zero for the United<lb/> States (i.e. the US value has been subtracted from each observation of the policy variable) so that β 1 can be<lb/> interpreted as the US-specific estimated effect. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline<lb/> specification outlined in equation <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>.<lb/> 47.<lb/> While equation <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> explores how policies shape the impact of changes in the patenting stock on<lb/> firm size for the average firm in the sample, there are reasons to suspect that the impact of policies may<lb/> vary with the characteristics of the firm. For example, regulations that impose a fixed cost on firms may<lb/> disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb such costs. Moreover,<lb/> to the extent that younger firms have a comparative advantage in radical innovations (see <ref type="biblio">Henderson,<lb/> 1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986</ref>), evidence that policies have a disproportionate effect on younger<lb/> firms is likely to be of particular interest to policymakers. Thus, to explore the extent to which policies<lb/> have heterogeneous effects according to the firm&apos;s age, the following equation is estimated:<lb/></p>

Old it is a dummy variable equal to one if firm i is more than<lb/> 5 years of age in 2006, and zero otherwise. The age of a firm is based on a firm&apos;s date of incorporation in<lb/> ORBIS. All other terms are identical to those in the baseline specification outlined in equation <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.2<lb/> Differences in differences estimation<lb/></head>

			<p>48.<lb/> To test the robustness of the baseline policy estimates, we explore whether the magnitude of the<lb/> impact of policies that shape the impact of patenting on firm size is stronger in sectors that are more likely<lb/> to be exposed to the policy at hand, due to their inherent technological characteristics. This approach,<lb/> popularised by Rajan and Zingales (1998), is based on the assumption that there exist industries that have<lb/> &apos;naturally&apos; high exposure to a given policy (i.e. the treatment group), and such industries – to the extent<lb/> that the policy is relevant to the outcome of interest – should be disproportionally more affected than other<lb/> industries (i.e. the control group). In other words, identification will be obtained comparing the differential<lb/> impact of patenting on firm characteristics (e.g. employment) between highly exposed industries and<lb/> marginally exposed industries in countries with different policy settings. While this approach does not<lb/> provide an estimate of the average effect of the policy of interest as in the baseline model (Section 4.2.1), it<lb/> nonetheless represents a useful robustness test to the core policy conclusions.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 21<lb/></p>

			<p>(C); and (ii) a vector of sectoral dummies (S). The specification also controls for firm fixed effects and<lb/> sector, country and year fixed effects. The parameter of interest is δ 1 . For example, if P corresponds to<lb/> Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and δ 1 &lt;0, then the adverse effect of stringent EPL on the<lb/> responsiveness of firm characteristics to patenting is stronger in more exposed sectors – such as those with<lb/> high job layoff rates – than less exposed sectors.<lb/> 50.<lb/> Industry-level indexes of exposure are taken from the large literature exploiting a similar<lb/> framework to infer the relevance of country-level policies on a number of economic outcomes.

Accordingly, the United States is excluded<lb/> from the analysis.

			<head>4.3<lb/> Identification concerns<lb/></head>

			<p>51.<lb/> Before proceeding, a number of caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.<lb/> First, the paper&apos;s primary aim is to highlight some potentially informative cross-country empirical<lb/> regularities using the estimation approach in <ref type="biblio">Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011)</ref>, but this approach<lb/> does not specifically address the issue of causality. While the instrumental variables estimator described in<lb/> Section 4.1.3 makes some progress on this front, the results (discussed in Section 5.1.3) only focus on the<lb/> link between patenting and firm size, and do not focus on how public policies might shape this<lb/> relationship. That said, an effort is made to reproduce the main policy conclusions using alternative<lb/> estimation frameworks – which might be less susceptible to endogeneity problems (such as differences-in-<lb/>differences estimation) – in order to improve the credibility of the policy recommendations, though further<lb/> work in this area is clearly required.<lb/> 52.<lb/> Second, due to the nature of the underlying data, national borders are imposed on firms. For<lb/> example, a firm is assigned to each country in which an unconsolidated account is published, and different<lb/> accounts in different countries are treated as different firms. Although an alternative patent measure based<lb/> on patents at group level is utilised (as described above), the increasingly international dimension of many<lb/> businesses may still affect the results. For instance, countries with many multinational enterprises (MNEs)<lb/> may see most of the occupational gains from patenting to occur in production sites located abroad, and the<lb/> intensity of this effect may correlate negatively with the country&apos;s size and openness (assuming that small<lb/> open economies are more likely to offshore production). Since an exploration of the within-firm and<lb/> cross-country effect of patenting is beyond the scope of this paper, the effects studied in this paper are thus<lb/> bounded by national borders, although as discussed in Section 6, we do make an (albeit crude) attempt to<lb/> control for this issue.<lb/> 53.<lb/> Third, the number of variables used to proxy a firm&apos;s inputs and output is limited, and patenting<lb/> may affect the firm&apos;s production structure along other unobserved dimensions (e.g. skill intensity, product<lb/> scope or the within-firm wage distribution). This issue is difficult to address given existing data sources<lb/> and thus the quantification of the extent to which firms adjust to the patent stock is limited to a set of<lb/> standard variables.<lb/> 54.<lb/> Finally, the extent to which firms react to a change in patent stock may also depend on the quality<lb/> of the patent system and the level of enforcement of IP rights. The former source of heterogeneity should<lb/> not be a major concern, since the estimates are remarkably stable across specifications based on patents<lb/> filed at international or national patent offices, respectively. The latter source of country heterogeneity is<lb/> partly dealt with by the inclusion of measures of civil justice efficiency among the policy variables<lb/> analysed; however, some countries have specialised courts for IP disputes, whose efficiency may not be<lb/> correctly measured by the general civil justice indicators.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 23<lb/></p>

			<p>55.<lb/> The upper panel of <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the estimated sensitivity of firm characteristics with respect to<lb/> the patent stock (based on a depreciated patent count). 17 The results show a statistically significant link<lb/> between patenting and firm size. For example, for the average firm in the sample, the estimates imply that<lb/> a 10% increase in the patent stock is associated with about a 1% increase in employment, a 1.3% increase<lb/> in the capital stock, a 0.3% increase in capital intensity, a 1.2% increase in turnover, and a 0.5% rise in<lb/> value-added. The association between patenting and productivity is small and positive, but not statistically<lb/> significant, which is broadly consistent with Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011).<lb/></p>

			<table>.<lb/> As a robustness check of the estimates, equation [1] was re-estimated solely for the United States<lb/> manufacturing sector and compared to the estimates in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). While<lb/> analysis in this paper is based on a lower quality data set and refers to a later time period than in the<lb/> 17<lb/> Given the wide set of fixed effects included and the sheer size of the dataset, regressions are incomputable<lb/> with a standard PC and traditional panel fixed-effect procedures. Therefore, estimates are obtained through<lb/> an algorithm for estimation of a linear regression model with two high dimensional fixed effects<lb/> implemented in STATA by Guimaraes and Portugal (2010).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 24<lb/> aforementioned study, it is reassuring that the results from this exercise were in the same ballpark to those<lb/> presented in Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011). 18<lb/> 57.<lb/> The lower panel of table <ref type="table">4</ref> shows that the estimates are almost identical when an alternative<lb/> measure of the patent stock, based on the depreciated count of distinct patent families, is employed. A<lb/> patent family is a group of patents, granted by different patent offices, which share the same priority<lb/> application. 19 Patent families may be a better proxy for innovative ideas, as companies generally tend to<lb/> patent the same inventions to many distinct patent offices around the world.<lb/> 58.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows the results from a long difference specification – i.e. just a cross-section of<lb/> 2009-2003 differences. 20 Long differences might better pick up long-run effects to the extent that they are<lb/> less subject to measurement error than year-to-year differences or fixed effects specifications, but they may<lb/> also exacerbate selection bias since only surviving firms are included. While the coefficient estimates in<lb/> the first four columns of <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> for employment, capital, capital intensity and turnover are similar or<lb/> somewhat larger to the corresponding coefficients in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, the coefficient on value added is two-to-three<lb/> times larger in the long difference specification relative to the baseline estimates. At the same time, the<lb/> coefficient on the patent stock in the TFP regression becomes statistically significant at conventional<lb/> levels. The estimates imply that – for the average firm in the sample – a 10% increase in the patent stock is<lb/> associated with a 2-2½% increase in TFP, depending on the specification (see Tables 5 and B3). This<lb/> effect is significant at the 5% level in the specification based on the sample for which data is available for<lb/> all firms (see <ref type="table">Table B3</ref>). While these results should be interpreted with caution given the well-known<lb/> problems with estimating TFP at the firm-level (see <ref type="biblio">Gal, 2013</ref>), they are nonetheless consistent with the<lb/> idea that the impact of new ideas on productivity may take some time to be realised, possibly reflecting the<lb/> need for organisational restructuring.<lb/></p>

			<p>60.<lb/> Thus far, the results suggest that patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at<lb/> the firm level across a sample of selected OECD countries. If the observed increases in size are indeed<lb/> linked to patenting, it is reasonable to expect a correlation between the magnitude of size increases and the<lb/> underlying quality of the patent. To test this idea, an interaction between the patent stock and citation-<lb/>based measures of the average quality of patents filed by the firm are added to equation <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. These<lb/> measures include (see <ref type="biblio">Squicciarini et al., 2010</ref>): i) &quot; Radicalness &quot; : the number of different International<lb/> Patent Classification (IPC) classes cited that are different from the one the patent belongs to (i.e. radical<lb/> patents are those who bring insights from different technologies); and ii) the number of citations to the<lb/> non-patent literature (NPL), which proxies for the closeness of patents to science.<lb/> 61.<lb/> The results are outlined in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> in a relatively smaller sample of countries since it was not<lb/> possible to construct patent quality measures for all countries (these estimates are based on EPO patents).<lb/> Relative to the baseline estimates that utilise a simple measure of patent counts, the results show that<lb/> increases in the radicalness-weighted patent stock is associated with larger increases in each firm<lb/> characteristic considered. These results correspond closely to the findings presented later in the paper,<lb/> which show that young firms are both more likely to file radical patents and demonstrate a higher<lb/> sensitivity of firm size to patenting than older firms (see <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>, Panel A). At the same time, the<lb/> NPL-weighted patent stock is associated with a similar or marginally smaller impact on all size measures<lb/> except the capital to labour ratio. Overall, these results are consistent with the interpretation that size<lb/> changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the firm level.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2<lb/> An event study of the extensive margin<lb/></head>

			<p>62.<lb/> As a complement to the within-firm analysis presented in Section 5.1.1, this section reports<lb/> results from the estimation of equation <ref type="biblio">[2b]</ref> which compares the post-patent performance of the first-time<lb/> patentees with a control group of non-patentee firms. This model essentially estimates the extensive margin<lb/> of patenting, i.e., the change in firm performance associated with the switch from being a non-patentee to<lb/> being a patentee firm. It is important to acknowledge that the data requirements of this exercise are quite<lb/> stringent and as such, the sample size is much smaller than in the baseline analysis. 21 Partly for this reason,<lb/> the results from this exercise should be treated only as suggestive and interpreted with some caution.<lb/> 63.<lb/> As explained in Section 4.1.2, the extensive margin is estimated by pairing each first time<lb/> patentee with an otherwise similar non patentee, and by comparing their performance before and after the<lb/></p>

			<figure>first patent has been filed for by the patentee. If significant differences emerge in the outcome variable<lb/> 21<lb/> The sample is limited to firms that appear at least 6 times between 2002 and 2009 and which belong to<lb/> countries with at least 100 observations. Among those, there are 784 first time patentees in the year 2005 or<lb/> 2006. Each of them is matched to a similar non-patentee; the final sample therefore amounts to 1568 firms<lb/> observed over a maximum of 9 years.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 28<lb/> from the year in which the patent application is filed – but not in preceding years – this would suggest that<lb/> resources tend to flow to firms that patent for the first time (in addition to firms that already patent and<lb/> increase the size of their patent stock).<lb/></figure>

			<p>64.<lb/> The coefficients&apos; estimates are shown in <ref type="table">Table B4</ref> of Appendix B and are more intuitively<lb/> illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The figure shows that, one year after the first patent, patentees have on average 5%<lb/> more employees and 10% more fixed capital than a non-patentee with similar inputs endowment over the<lb/> four previous years. Two years after the first patent, the difference is around 9% for employment, and 12%<lb/> for capital. These differences are statistically significant and increase over time, while in the years before<lb/> patenting, there a no significant differences in these outcome variables. Overall, these results provide<lb/> further support for the idea that the size changes accompanying patenting are related to innovation at the<lb/> firm level.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.3<lb/> Instrumental variables estimation<lb/></head>

			<p>65.<lb/> To check whether the link between patenting and firm size is causal, <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> presents the IV<lb/> estimates where the firm patent stock is instrumented by the litigation propensity indicator developed in<lb/> Section 4.1.3. The first stage regression output in Panel C shows a statistically significant relationship<lb/> between the &quot; technological field weighted &quot; exposure of firms to litigation risk and the firm patent stock,<lb/> thereby demonstrating the strength of the instrument. The IV estimates in Panel B confirm that there is a<lb/> statistically significant relationship between the patent stock and firm size. As discussed in Appendix C,<lb/> these results are robust to a falsification test (Panel D of <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>), which suggests that the second stage<lb/> results are unlikely to be biased by a long-run firm specific trend that is correlated with both the<lb/> technological specialisation of the firm in the pre-sample period and its economic activity during the period<lb/> of analysis. While this suggests that the baseline relationship can be interpreted as causal, the magnitude of<lb/> the IV coefficients is larger than the OLS estimates shown in Panel A and the IV estimates are clearly less<lb/> precise as demonstrated by the size of the standard errors. Nevertheless, the significance of the IV<lb/> estimates is encouraging and future work will focus on further refining this approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>66.<lb/> The results in Section 5.1 show that on average across a sub-sample of OECD countries,<lb/> patenting is associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level. In this section, the extent to<lb/> which resource flows to patenting firms vary across countries is explored. One simple – albeit relatively<lb/> crude – way to do this is to interact the patent stock – i.e. PatS in equation (1) – with various country<lb/> dummies. The estimated coefficients (reported in <ref type="table">Table B5</ref> of Appendix B) capture the average country-<lb/>specific relationship between patenting and resource flows over the sample period.

			<p>67.<lb/> With the above caveats in mind, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> uses these estimated coefficients for a selected set of<lb/> countries to calculate the association between a 10% change in the patent stock and the change in capital<lb/> and employment, for the average firm in our sample. While not all country-specific estimates are<lb/> statistically different from one another – that is, the standard errors are relatively wide in some cases –<lb/> some interesting cross-country differences nonetheless emerge when the focus in narrowed to the more<lb/> precisely estimated effects. For example, a 10% increase in the firm level patent stock is associated with<lb/> about a 3% rise in firm capital in Sweden and the United States; a 1½-2% increase in firm capital in the<lb/> UK, Japan and Germany; and a ½-¾ % rise in firm capital in Italy (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>; Panel A). Similarly, the ease<lb/> with which patenting firms in the United States can attract labour is roughly twice as large as the average<lb/> OECD country (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>; Panel B).<lb/></p>

			<p>resemblance to cross-country differences in post-entry employment<lb/> dynamics, which illustrate that young firms in the United States – and to a lesser extent, Sweden – exhibit<lb/> &quot; up-or-out &quot; dynamics (<ref type="biblio">Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014</ref>). That is, young firms either:<lb/> i) grow very rapidly; or ii) they fail and exit the market rather than remaining in business as low-<lb/>performing small firms, suggesting that market selection is very harsh and reallocation significant in such<lb/> environments. By contrast, the potential growth of firms in Southern European countries – particularly<lb/> Italy – is much lower, which tends to manifest itself in a high share of old and small firms, which tend to<lb/> be less innovative. From a policy perspective, this predominance of old and small firms raises the risk that<lb/> valuable resources (e.g. human and physical capital) are clogged up in undersized and inefficient firms,<lb/> which in turn makes it more difficult for high productivity firms to attract resources and grow (<ref type="biblio">Acemoglu<lb/> et al., 2013</ref>), bearing on aggregate productivity developments.69. At the same time, a number of somewhat<lb/> surprising results emerge which may reflect the limitations of this analysis. For instance, the low sensitivity<lb/> of resources to patenting in countries such as Denmark and Finland (see <ref type="table">Table B5</ref>) may reflect the fact that<lb/> firms in small open economies may expand abroad rather than domestically, but it is difficult to capture<lb/> this margin of adjustment with the available data. Additional analysis suggests that patenting has a larger<lb/> effect on average profitability and wages than firm size in these countries, but this cannot explain all of the<lb/> observed differences.<lb/></p>

			<p>70.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> summarises the estimation results of equation <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> for two dependent variables –<lb/> employment and capital – when one policy interaction is included at a time. As already mentioned, each<lb/> policy variable has been re-scaled to equal zero for the United States. Thus, the coefficient on PatS can be<lb/> interpreted as the US-specific effect, while the interaction term PatS*Policy provides an estimate of the<lb/> additional effect of an increase in the relevant policy index relative to the United States.<lb/> 71.<lb/> Overall, while causality is difficult to establish, the results are consistent with the idea that well<lb/> designed framework policies can raise the expected returns to innovative activity, by making it easier for<lb/> patenting firms to attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas.<lb/> Focusing first on statistical significance, a number of results emerge:<lb/> • Less efficient judicial systems – as measured by a higher cost of enforcing contracts – are<lb/> associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting. This is<lb/> consistent with research showing that difficulties in enforcing contracts lower the returns to<lb/> innovation (<ref type="biblio">Nunn, 2007</ref>) and make it more costly to hire the skilled workers necessary to<lb/> underpin firm growth (<ref type="biblio">Bloom et. al., 2012</ref>).<lb/> • Bankruptcy regimes that more severely penalise failure – as measured by a higher cost to close a<lb/> business – are associated with a lower responsiveness of firm employment and capital to<lb/> patenting. This finding provides a dynamic perspective to existing research, which shows that<lb/> stringent bankruptcy regimes disproportionately lower static allocative efficiency in sectors with<lb/> naturally higher firm turnover rates where regulations affecting exit costs are most likely to bind<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2014</ref>). More broadly, by lowering the returns to innovation, the adverse<lb/> effects of poorly designed bankruptcy regimes on the allocative efficiency could explain why less<lb/> debtor-friendly bankruptcy codes have been associated with lower intensity of patent creation,<lb/> patent citations and slower growth in countries relatively more specialised in innovative<lb/> industries (<ref type="biblio">Acharya and Subramanian, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>• More cumbersome product market regulation (PMR) is associated with a lower responsiveness of<lb/> firm employment to patenting. This may reflect the tendency for such regulations to raise the cost<lb/> structure of inputs that are required by innovative firms to underpin their expansion (<ref type="biblio">Bourlès et<lb/> al., 2013</ref>). Similarly, in less competitive environments, valuable resources (e.g. skilled labour)<lb/> may be more likely to be trapped in inefficient firms, making it more difficult for high potential<lb/> firms to expand.<lb/> • More stringent barriers to trade and investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm<lb/> capital to changes in the patent stock. This is in line with existing research that shows that across<lb/> OECD services sectors, higher restrictions on FDI are associated with lower static allocative<lb/> efficiency (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2014</ref>).<lb/> • More stringent employment protection legislation (EPL) is associated with a lower<lb/> responsiveness of firm employment and capital to patenting. This is consistent with existing<lb/> research which highlights the adverse effects of stringent EPL on reallocation mechanisms<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Andrews and Cingano, 2014; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/> • The importance of finance to promoting the growth of patenting firms is affirmed by a number of<lb/> results, which is in line with a host of studies that highlight the importance of financial<lb/> development for firm growth (<ref type="biblio">Aghion et al., 2007; Bravo-Biosca et al., 2013</ref>). For example:<lb/></p>

			<p>− More developed markets for seed and early stage venture capital (VC) are positively<lb/> associated with resource flows (as measured by employment and capital) to patenting firms.<lb/> − The same is true for deeper stock markets with respect to firm employment and VC markets<lb/> at the expansion stage with respect to firm capital. 22<lb/> 72.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table B6</ref> explores the robustness of the baseline policy estimates in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> to the inclusion of<lb/> selected multiple policy interaction terms. Given the computational burdens involved, we implement a<lb/> baseline specification that includes EPL and one product market regulation term (overall PMR for<lb/> employment and barriers to trade and investment for capital) and then an additional policy interaction at<lb/> time (these policies correspond to finance, bankruptcy and judicial inefficiency). While the baseline policy<lb/> results are qualitatively robust to the inclusion of multiple policy interaction terms, in a few instances some<lb/> coefficients become insignificant. This presumably reflects a multicollinearity issue, given the relatively<lb/> high correlation between some of the policy variables in our analysis. This is particularly the case for the<lb/> early stage finance term – strongly correlated with the two product market regulation variables (the<lb/> correlation coefficient between this variable and PMR and BTI is around 0.6) – which becomes<lb/> insignificant in the employment equation (Panel A, column 3) and in the capital equation (Panel B,<lb/> column 2). The same is true for the overall PMR interaction (Panel A, column 2), which loses statistical<lb/> significance when the stock market capitalisation interaction is included (the correlation between these two<lb/> variables is around 0.7).<lb/> 73.<lb/> To provide a sense of the economic significance of these results, the policy experiments in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> illustrates how the estimated flow of resources to patenting firms varies with different public<lb/> policy settings. Using the coefficients from <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>, the figure shows the per cent change in employment<lb/> and capital associated with a 10% increase in the patent stock when the policy variable of interest is set<lb/> equal to the sample minimum, mean and maximum values respectively. For example, Panel A shows that<lb/> the sensitivity of firm employment to changes in the patent stock is more than three times larger when<lb/> PMR is relatively low (e.g. the United Kingdom), compared to when PMR is very stringent (e.g. in<lb/> Poland). To the extent that these relationships can be interpreted as causal, these examples of comparative<lb/> statics suggest that framework policies could significantly affect the extent to which patenting firms can<lb/> attract the tangible resources required to implement and commercialise new ideas.<lb/> 22<lb/> However, the impact of banking regulation on resource flows to patenting firms is unclear.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.2<lb/> Heterogeneous effects: policies and firm age<lb/></head>

			<p>74.<lb/> Thus far, the estimated impact of framework policies on resource flows to patenting firms<lb/> pertains to the average firm in the sample. However, to the extent that the characteristics of firms vary<lb/> significantly, even within narrowly defined industries (<ref type="biblio">Syverson 2011</ref>), policies that appear neutral in<lb/> design may have non-neutral impacts on firms because of the diversity of firms characteristics. For<lb/> example, firm age might be a particularly relevant characteristic to the extent that regulations that impose a<lb/> fixed cost on firms may disproportionately affect young firms that typically have fewer resources to absorb<lb/> such a cost. At the same time, emerging research highlights the importance of young firms for employment<lb/> creation (see <ref type="biblio">Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Criscuolo et al., 2014</ref>) and facilitating the expansion of successful<lb/> innovative start-ups is particularly important for long-run growth. This is because firms that drive one<lb/> technological wave often fail to continue to do so in the subsequent one, as they tend to concentrate on<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 35<lb/> incremental improvements (<ref type="biblio">Benner and Tushman, 2002</ref>), and young firms possess a comparative<lb/> advantage in commercialising radical innovations (<ref type="biblio">Henderson, 1993; Tushman and Anderson, 1986</ref>). 23<lb/> Indeed, these ideas are borne out in <ref type="table">Table B7</ref>, which documents a robust negative relationship between<lb/> firm age and the two indicators of the patent radicalness introduced in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. The estimates in column 2<lb/> imply that the number of citations to the non-patent literature (which proxies the closeness of patents to<lb/> science) could be expected to be about 16% higher for a relatively young firm aged 5 years compared to a<lb/> firm aged 30 years.<lb/></p>

			<p>One policy interaction included in each regression; using yearly variation<lb/> Notes: Robust standard errors clustered at country-industry level in parenthesis. The patent stock is calculated as the log(X+1) where<lb/> X is the cumulated number of granted patents since the 1980 depreciated at the rate 15% per year. Young firms are defined as firms<lb/> that are 5 years of age or less in 2006 – the midpoint of the sample. Firm and country-sector-year fixed effects are included in all<lb/> regressions. *** significant at 1%, ** significant at 5%, * significant at 10%.<lb/> 75.<lb/> Accordingly, <ref type="table">Table 10</ref> explores the extent to which the estimated effects vary with the age of the<lb/> firm (e.g. equation 4). The top left panel shows how the relationship between patenting and firm size varies<lb/> with the age of the firm. The estimates suggest that the sensitivity of firm size with respect to changes in<lb/> the patent stock is around twice as large for young firms than for older firms, and this difference is<lb/> statistically significant at the 5% level (as illustrated by the F-test). The remaining panels of <ref type="table">Table 10<lb/></ref> explore whether the impact of selected policies on the sensitivity of firm size to patenting varies according<lb/> to the age of the firm. In most cases, the impact of policies does not vary with the age of the firm (and thus<lb/> not all policy variables are reported in the Table). However, young firms appear to be particularly sensitive<lb/> to EPL, with the positive effect of a one unit reduction in the OECD EPL Index (on the impact of patenting<lb/> on capital) being about three times larger for young firms than older firms (the F-test suggests that this<lb/> 23<lb/> The same is true for implementing innovations that appear relatively incremental from a technological<lb/> point of view but require fundamental organisational restructuring (<ref type="biblio">Henderson and Clark, 1990</ref>).<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 36<lb/> difference is statistically significant for capital but not employment). 24 This may reflect the idea that young<lb/> firms are more sensitive to rigidities in the reallocation process, given that they are more likely to<lb/> experiment with uncertain technologies (see <ref type="biblio">Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013</ref>). The same is true with respect<lb/> to higher stock market capitalisation and, unsurprisingly, young firms are much more sensitive to the<lb/> availability of seed and early stage financing than older firms.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.3<lb/> Heterogeneous effects: differences-in-differences estimation<lb/></head>

			<p>76.<lb/> If framework policies influence the ease with which innovative firms can attract tangible<lb/> resources, it is reasonable to expect that the impact of policies should be more evident in sectors that, a<lb/> priori, are likely to be more exposed to a given policy, owing to their technological characteristics for<lb/> example. Accordingly, Tables 11 and B8 present the differences-in-differences coefficient estimates for the<lb/> parameter δ 1 on the triple interaction term<lb/></p>

			<p>ln(<lb/> in equation <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> for the firm employment<lb/> and capital stock regressions respectively. To the extent that this specification is particularly demanding<lb/> from a computational perspective, we limit the differences-in-differences estimation to focus on the subset<lb/> of policy interaction terms that are statistically significant in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>. Since we are interested in testing the<lb/> robustness of our baseline policy estimates, we focus on the sign and statistical significance of the<lb/> differences-in-differences coefficient estimates, as opposed to their economic magnitude (which are more<lb/> difficult to infer given that they measure indirect effects).<lb/> 77.<lb/> This exercise confirms many of the baseline findings from <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>, and provides some useful<lb/> insights into the channels through which our baseline policy effects may operate. For example:<lb/> • In sectors that are particularly dynamic and have more intense reallocation needs (i.e. those with<lb/> more firm entry, job layoffs and firm turnover rates), patenting firms can more easily attract<lb/> resources in environments where: i) EPL is less stringent (see Columns 1-2 of Tables 11 and B8);<lb/> ii) markets for seed and early stage venture capital are more developed (see Column 3 of Tables<lb/> 11 and B8); iii) bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (see Columns 4-5 of<lb/> Tables 11 and B8); iv) judicial systems are more efficient (Column 6 of <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>); and v) product<lb/> market regulations are less cumbersome (Column 7 of <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>).<lb/> • In sectors more dependent on external financing, resource more readily flow to patenting firms in<lb/> environments where stock market capitalisation to GDP is higher (Column 8 of <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>) and<lb/> bankruptcy legislation is less punishing of business failure (Columns 5 of Tables 11 and B8).<lb/></p>

			<p>• Finally, in sectors with higher trade intensity, more stringent barriers to international trade and<lb/> investment are associated with a lower sensitivity of firm capital to patenting relative to other<lb/> sectors (Column 7 of</p>

			<table>Table B8).<lb/> 24<lb/> A one unit reduction in the EPL index (on regular contracts) roughly corresponds to the difference between<lb/> Switzerland and the United States in 2008.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 37<lb/> Table 11.

			<p>• Addressing the potential bias originating from the log(X+1) transformation. This is done in two<lb/> different ways:<lb/></p>

			<p>− Estimating separately the coefficient on patent stock in two subsamples: only firms with a<lb/> positive patent stock (<ref type="table">Table B2</ref>, Panel A), and firms patenting for the first time (<ref type="table">Table B2</ref>,<lb/> Panel B). In the first case, the (always positive) patent stock can be expressed in simple<lb/> logarithmic form (without adding one) and the coefficients are estimates of the intensive<lb/> margin effect only. In the second case, the main dependent variable is a &quot; patentee &quot; dummy<lb/> equal to one if the patent stock is positive, and zero otherwise. The sample is limited to zero-<lb/>patent firms and to &quot; switchers &quot; , i.e., firms that change their status from non-patentee to<lb/> patentee over the sample period, while always-patentees are dropped. Results are broadly<lb/> consistent across the two samples, suggesting that the effect at the intensive and extensive<lb/> margin is comparable.<lb/></p>

			<table>− Including a zero patent dummy to the baseline regressions. This method – already used in the<lb/> patent literature (Klette, 1996) – tests whether the estimates are robust to accounting for a<lb/> 25<lb/> Some of these results are not reported for sake of brevity, but are available from the authors upon request.<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 38<lb/> potential heterogeneous effect at the intensive and extensive margin, respectively. The<lb/> estimates coefficients are very similar to those obtained from the baseline regressions.<lb/></table>

			<p>• Controlling for some potentially confounding country factors that might be correlated with<lb/> policies. These include: (a) interactions between the Patent Stock and real GDP (in level and per<lb/> capita terms) to control for the possibility that small countries may be more likely to choose a<lb/> certain set of policies; and (b) interactions between the patent stock and outward FDI flows to<lb/> control for the possibility that in more globally oriented economies, firms might be more likely to<lb/> expand their operations offshore following a change in the patent stock. These results are<lb/> reported in <ref type="table">Table B9</ref>, and most policy interactions retain their statistical significance.<lb/> • Using a measure of the patent stock that is not depreciated and restricting the sample to the set of<lb/> firms for which employment, capital, turnover, and valued added are all available.<lb/> • Controlling for firm-level R&amp;D expenditures: if the within-firm variation in R&amp;D expenditures is<lb/> positively correlated with changes in other inputs (namely employment and capital), then the<lb/> estimated (positive) relationship between these variables and patenting activity could be partly<lb/> spurious given the well-documented positive correlation between R&amp;D and patenting.<lb/> Unfortunately, R&amp;D data in ORBIS are very incomplete (data are only available for about 35 000<lb/> firm*year observations) so is not possible to control for R&amp;D in the baseline specification.<lb/> Nevertheless, estimation performed on this limited sub-sample of firms indicates that while the<lb/> impact of R&amp;D expenditures is positive and statistically significant, the coefficient on the patent<lb/> variable is unaffected by either the sample reduction or the inclusion of the additional control.<lb/></p>

			<head>7.<lb/> Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>79.<lb/> This paper exploits a novel cross-country OECD database on firm performance and patenting<lb/> activity to explore what happens when firms patent. The results suggest that changes in patenting are<lb/> associated with real changes in economic activity at the firm level and new evidence is presented to<lb/> suggest that the link between patenting and firm size is causal.<lb/> 80.<lb/> In turn, the paper highlights some interesting cross-country differences in patterns of reallocation<lb/> toward patenting firms. Important differences emerge in the ease with which patenting firms can attract the<lb/> tangible resources required to underpin the implementation and commercialisation of new ideas. Although<lb/> patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation, these results points to a more general assessment of the<lb/> role of national policies and framework condition in shaping the flow of resources to the most innovative<lb/> firms. For instance, one interpretation is that the returns to innovation vary across OECD countries and the<lb/> econometric analysis indicates that cross-country differences in the functioning of product, labour and<lb/> capital markets, in the efficiency of judicial systems and in the design of bankruptcy laws can provide<lb/> some explanation of why the expected returns from patenting activities may vary. The benefits of well-<lb/>designed policies in these areas are partly realised through stronger competitive pressures and more<lb/> efficient reallocation, which make it easier for successful firms to implement and commercialise new ideas<lb/> and, by lowering the costs of failure, encourage firms to experiment with uncertain growth opportunities.<lb/></p>

			<figure>81.<lb/> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore cross-country differences in<lb/> resource flows to patenting firms and further research on this issue is required. Indeed, a number of<lb/> avenues for future research emerge. First, the data underlying the current paper is based on matching<lb/> administrative data on patents and the commercial database ORBIS. As discussed this raises issues related<lb/> to sample representativeness and coverage, and it warrants some caution when interpreting some of the<lb/> results presented, e.g. on young firms. Therefore, one avenue for further research is to use information<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 39<lb/> from matching patent data with business register data, which cover the whole population of businesses and<lb/> survey data based on stratified random samples from National Statistical Offices.<lb/></figure>

			<p>82.<lb/> Second, the paper currently considers only two specific characteristics of firms&apos; patent portfolio:<lb/> radicalness, defined as the number of different IPC classes cited, and closeness to science. Current OECD<lb/> research (<ref type="biblio">Squicciarini et al., 2013</ref>) is developing additional indicators of novelty and radicalness as well as<lb/> other features of patents, such as scope and originality.<lb/> 83.<lb/> Third, the data used in this analysis only allow an investigation of the growth of firms within<lb/> national boundaries. However, firms might grow and expand abroad, especially if they operate in small<lb/> open economies and if they can replicate their ideas at a low cost. As discussed in the previous section, the<lb/> relationship between patenting and firm size does not vary consistently with the extent of outward Foreign<lb/> Direct Investment (FDI) at the aggregate level, but clearly firm-level data on FDI is required to test this<lb/> hypothesis properly.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> APPENDIX A: A SIMPLE ALGORITHM TO DEFINE GROUPS IN ORBIS<lb/></figure>

			<p>1.<lb/> This note describes the procedure implemented to refine the information available in the OECD-<lb/>ORBIS (June 2011) dataset on firms&apos; ownership structure with the aim to create a group identifier. The<lb/> identifier allows to significantly refining the information of firms&apos; patenting, for several reasons. First, it is<lb/> plausible to assume that firms belonging to a group can also access the patent stock – and the relative<lb/> knowledge base – of other affiliated firms. Second, firms belonging to a group may be different from<lb/> singleton firms in their ability to attract resources; this may be particularly relevant in the case of<lb/> multinational groups. Third, identifying group patents may also limit the bias originating from the firm-<lb/>patent matching procedure. Such a matching is based on a probabilistic similarity score and whenever a<lb/> patent is matched with similar probability to two firms some disambiguation rules need to be applied. One<lb/> of these rules says that, in the case in which the disambiguation involves a headquarters and its affiliate,<lb/> the former becomes the owner of the patent. This may introduce a relevant bias if the analysis is based on<lb/> unconsolidated accounts (as it is the case in this paper).<lb/> 2.<lb/> The ORBIS June 2011 dataset contains information on ownership; however, further elaboration<lb/> on this data is needed in order to obtain a meaningful, although approximate, group identifier for most<lb/> companies. This appendix describes the procedure which was developed for this purpose.<lb/> 3.<lb/> ORBIS ownership information is organised in year-specific tables containing the following<lb/> columns: the identifier of the owned firm (BVD_ID), the identifier of the shareowner firm (SH_BVD_ID),<lb/> the kind of linkage (LINK_TYPE), the share of direct ownership (DIRECT), and the share of total<lb/> ownership (TOTAL). Individual owned companies can have more than a shareholder, and owned-<lb/>shareholder pairs can appear with different linkages and ownership shares. LINK_TYPE can take the<lb/> following values: GUO (global ultimate owner), DUO (domestic ultimate owner), ISH (intermediate<lb/> shareholder), and ACT (active).<lb/> 4.<lb/> A first issue to address is that not all the owned companies are matched to a GUO; around 40%<lb/> are matched to an ISH. However, some of those ISHs are listed themselves as owned companies; this<lb/> implies that their ultimate owner is also the ultimate owner of the company they own. An example may<lb/> clarify the problem: A is owned by B, and B is an ISH, not a GUO. In the ownership table there are no<lb/> other owners of A listed companies. However, a few lines below, a record shows that B is owned by C, and<lb/> C is defined as a GUO (see <ref type="table">table A1</ref>). It logically follows that C is also the GUO of A, and that A, B, C all<lb/> belong to the same group. It would therefore be useful to create a table like <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table A1 – Original table example<lb/> BVD_ID SH_BVD_ID LINK_TYPE<lb/> A<lb/> B<lb/> ISH<lb/> B<lb/> C<lb/> GUO<lb/> Table A2 – Final desired output<lb/> BVD_ID GUO GROUP ID<lb/> A<lb/> C<lb/> 1<lb/> B<lb/> C<lb/> 1<lb/> C<lb/> 1<lb/> ECO/WKP(2014)23<lb/> 45<lb/> 5.<lb/></table>

			<p>In this simple case, only one step is needed to find the ultimate owner for company A. However,<lb/> it could also be possible that the steps are more than one, because the owner of the first company is itself<lb/> owned by an intermediate shareholder, and so on. Furthermore, each company can have more than one<lb/> intermediate shareholder, thus different alternative paths may lead to different ultimate GUOs. As a<lb/> consequence, if the ownership structure is not simplified at every step, the web of links may growth<lb/> exponentially and the process may become unmanageable, also considering the sheer dimension of the<lb/> dataset, which makes the whole procedure very computing intensive.<lb/> 6.<lb/> Therefore, the algorithm is based on three main assumptions aimed at simplifying the ownership<lb/> structure. These assumptions are necessary to keep the process manageable but they are not neutral, and<lb/> they should be customised according to the different scopes the grouping process. They could also be<lb/> related to the size of the dataset: smaller datasets allow weaker assumptions, are the need to reduce the<lb/> number of links by simplifying the ownership structure is less stringent.<lb/> 7.<lb/> In the specific case of the group identifier developed for this paper, the assumptions are the<lb/> following: direct and total ownership conveys the same message; all the ownership links below a set<lb/> threshold (25%) of ownership rate, or with missing information, are considered to be irrelevant and are<lb/> therefore dropped; in the case of multiple ownership links defined as &quot; ultimate &quot; (i.e., where the owner is<lb/> either a DUO or a GUO), only the one with the highest share (direct or total) is kept.<lb/> 8.<lb/> The algorithm is composed by three steps which are sequentially performed and are iteratively<lb/> repeated until all companies have a final GUO, i.e., a non-owned owner, listed.<lb/></p>

			<p>–<lb/> The first step simplifies the ownership links, by performing the following operations:<lb/> a. All links where direct and total ownership shares are both below 25% are dropped.<lb/> b. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and one of these is a GUO link,<lb/> only the latter is kept.<lb/> c. If there are multiple BVD_ID – SH_BVD_ID combinations and none of these is a GUO link,<lb/> the one(s) with the highest total ownership share are kept.<lb/> d. If there are multiple owners for the same BVD_ID and one of these is a GUO link, only the<lb/> latter is kept.<lb/></p>

			<p>–<lb/> The second step stores the BVD_ID which have a listed GUO already.<lb/></p>

			<p>–<lb/> The third step joins the list of all companies which do not have a GUO yet with itself and with<lb/> the list of all companies with a GUO which have been previously stored. The number of times<lb/> each company is listed in the new joined table is equal to the number of owners of their owners:<lb/> i.e., if company A has N owners which in turn have K owners each, it appears in N*K rows in the<lb/> dataset. This step also updates the ownership shares (direct and total) with the product of the<lb/> share of the first linkage with the share of the second linkage.<lb/></p>

			<p>–<lb/> The procedure then restarts from step one.<lb/></p>
