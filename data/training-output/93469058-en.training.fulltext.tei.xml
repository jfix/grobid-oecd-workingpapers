			<p>This paper is an output of the &quot; Contingent Liabilities and Public Debt Management Project &quot; initiated<lb/> under the OECD Working Party on Debt Management (WPDM). Taşkın Temiz, the Task Force Chair<lb/> on behalf of Turkey, mobilised the efforts of task force countries and ensured that the Turkish<lb/> Treasury extended its full institutional support to the project. A team of experts from the OECD<lb/> secretariat and task force countries was involved in the project. Prof. Hans J. Blommestein, former<lb/> Head of the Bond Market and Public Debt Management Unit, supervised the project for two years; he<lb/> coordinated work on the 2013 survey and worked closely with task force members. His successor,<lb/> Fatoş Koç supported the work throughout the publication process in addition to contributing valuable<lb/> comments and thoughts. Perla Ibarlucea Flores (OECD) and Hakan Bingöl (Turkish Treasury)<lb/> compiled the survey results, and coordinated communication between task force countries. The<lb/> authors are grateful to Mehmet Emre Elmadağ, Mustafa Burak Şener and Tuğba İldaş from the<lb/> Turkish Treasury who contributed comments and support.<lb/></p>

			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>Contingent liabilities are significant sources of fiscal risks. History has shown that if governments<lb/> do not effectively manage fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities and take necessary risk<lb/> management measures in a timely manner, they can be caught unprepared for their fiscal burden.<lb/> From a sovereign debt management perspective, effective management of fiscal risks arising<lb/> from contingent liabilities has long been a concern because realisation of these risks has direct<lb/> consequences on governments&apos; fiscal positions and thereby public debt managers&apos; debt and cash<lb/> management policies and operations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our research shows that governments have increased their use of guarantees and other types of<lb/> contingent liabilities since the global financial crisis; in fact, the use of such instruments was a key<lb/> element of policy response to the crisis. Areas where this increase is most evident are; financial sector<lb/> support; credit enhancement for infrastructure financing in traditional and PPP procurement models;<lb/> and SME financing. Thus, effective management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has become<lb/> more important for governments than in the past.<lb/> Against this background, this paper explores the role of public debt managers in managing<lb/> explicit contingent liabilities based on country practices. To this end, we considered responses to a<lb/> survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs 1 of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries<lb/> (Brazil and South Africa) conducted by the OECD&apos;s Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit<lb/> in October 2013. Additionally, the paper examines task force members -Turkey (Chair), Sweden,<lb/> Denmark, Iceland, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa -experiences (Annex A).<lb/> One key finding of this study shows that the degree of DMO involvement in this area varies<lb/> widely across countries, as well as by types of contingent liabilities, of Debt managers&apos; experiences<lb/> are also quite diverse, stemming mainly from weight variance of different sources of contingent<lb/> liabilities in task force countries, and from differences in their public financial management<lb/> frameworks. However, there are similarities among countries with respect to fiscal risk management<lb/> tools and methods employed for managing and mitigating risks of contingent liabilities, such as<lb/> guarantee issuance guidelines, budgetary limits, contingency reserve funds, parliamentary reporting,<lb/> etc. Study findings point to the more active involvement of DMOs in management of government<lb/> credit guarantees compared to other sources of contingent liabilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study analyses country practices in three categories of contingent liabilities from the public<lb/> debt management (PDM) perspective: i) government credit guarantees, ii) contingent liabilities arising<lb/> from PPPs and iii) government sponsored insurance schemes. It provides insights and<lb/> recommendations to help DMOs enhance their management practices. In countries where DMOs do<lb/> not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal risk management in general and contingent liability<lb/> management in particular, the following recommendations may be relevant for other government<lb/> units.<lb/> In the area of government credit guarantees, this research builds largely upon information<lb/> collected in responses to the OECD survey. The recommendations include conducting cost and risk<lb/> analysis before guarantee issuance, charging fees at levels covering at least the expected costs, clearly<lb/> defining and limiting the guarantees in time and scope in credit guarantee contracts, applying ceilings<lb/> to promote fiscal discipline, increasing governments&apos; ability to cover possible future losses and<lb/> monitoring the overall position through contingency reserve funds, and enhancing transparency by<lb/> sharing both quantitative and qualitative information.<lb/> This study suggests certain areas for more active involvement by public debt managers in the<lb/> management of contingent liabilities arising from PPPs. DMOs can collaborate with the central<lb/> budget authority and PPP units in data consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on PPP<lb/> contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting. The study highlights the need<lb/> for a central government unit analysing PPP guarantees to inform decision-making authorities on<lb/> associated costs and risks. At the portfolio level, central monitoring of contingent liabilities under PPP<lb/> contracts for ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability is considered essential where public debt managers<lb/> can be effectively involved. It is important to note that guarantee valuation is key for informing PPP<lb/> decision making, since guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and private partner.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the government sponsored insurance schemes category, the study focuses on explicit<lb/> contingent commitments by governments under such schemes. It recommends that clear legislative<lb/> frameworks should define the scope and nature of the role of government within insurance<lb/> programmes. Regular co-ordination and communication mechanisms between relevant agencies and<lb/> public debt managers over fiscal risks arising from the financial system are essential for effective<lb/> information sharing.<lb/></p>

			<table>1. INTRODUCTION<lb/> 1.1.<lb/> Background and purpose<lb/> OECD best practices in the area of contingent liability management from the perspective of debt<lb/> managers were formulated in 2005 with the study &quot; Explicit Contingent Liabilities in Debt<lb/> Management&apos;&apos; 2 (2005 Report). The 2005 report recommends centralisation of risk management of<lb/> government debt portfolio including contingent liabilities and suggests that public debt managers are<lb/> well positioned to assume this duty. The report characterises contingent liabilities as a latent form of<lb/> sovereign debt, and discusses that their management might call for involvement of public debt<lb/> managers.<lb/> During the 22 nd OECD Global Forum on Public Debt Management (24-25 January 2013, Paris),<lb/> where the 2005 Report was distributed as a background document, there was a discussion on the<lb/> policy framework for capturing, measuring and mitigating the fiscal risks arising from contingent<lb/> liabilities. Delegates agreed there was a need to carry out further studies on the role of public debt<lb/> managers in contingent liability management, focusing more on the implementation side to add to the<lb/> analytical framework provided by the 2005 report. Delegates also suggested that new work should<lb/> cover post crisis developments and PPP guarantees.<lb/> In October 2013, the OECD&apos;s Bond Markets and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a<lb/> survey on contingent liabilities among DMOs of OECD countries and two non-OECD countries<lb/> (Brazil and South Africa.to which 33 countries (out of 36), replied. The survey included detailed<lb/> questions about management of explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. As</table>

			<p>the next step, a task<lb/> force was formed, consisting of seven countries -Turkey (Chair), Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Mexico,<lb/> Brazil and South Africa, to work with the OECD on this subject area, Task force members drafted<lb/> detailed and comprehensive reports (Annex A) on their contingent liability management structures<lb/> and operations.<lb/> Given this background, the aim of this paper is:<lb/></p>

			<p>i) to explore the role of public debt managers in contingent liability management, drawing on the<lb/> information compiled through the OECD survey and the task force country contributions ii) provide<lb/> policy conclusions and recommendations for DMOs. The paper benefits from, and builds upon, the<lb/></p>

			<table>2005 report&apos;s analytical framework. 3<lb/> 2 The 2005 Report was drafted by an ad hoc expert group of the OECD WPDM.

			<head>1.2.<lb/> Types of contingent liabilities and the study&apos;s scope<lb/></head>

			<p>Various definitions of the term &quot; contingent liability &quot; exist in fiscal management literature. The<lb/> OECD&apos;s Best Practices for Budget Transparency defines contingent liabilities as &quot; … liabilities whose<lb/> budgetary impact is dependent on future events which may or may not occur (2002: 13) &quot; . They are<lb/> defined as &quot; obligations whose timing and magnitude depend on the occurrence of some uncertain<lb/> future event outside the control of the government &quot; by Cebotari A. (2008: 5). There are also some<lb/> other definitions in accounting and statistical standard manuals. 4 A common feature of these<lb/> definitions is the existence of &quot; uncertainty &quot; over the obligation in question. Uncertainty differentiates<lb/> contingent liabilities from direct liabilities. Contingent liabilities become government obligations only<lb/> when triggered by a pre-defined event or condition, the occurrence of which is not certain.<lb/> In literature, contingent liabilities are divided into two main groups based on the notion of<lb/> &quot; obligation &quot; : 5 explicit and implicit contingent liabilities. Explicit contingent liabilities are contractual<lb/> government commitments to make certain payments if a particular event occurs. The basis of these<lb/> commitments can be contracts, laws, or clear policy statements. Governments issue explicit contingent<lb/> liabilities in order to subsidise certain activities, (e.g. housing production, exports, and student loans)<lb/> or to fill gaps in the markets that private solutions are deemed unable to cover (e.g. risks that are too<lb/> large for markets to bear). The most common examples of such liabilities are government credit<lb/> guarantees, explicit guarantee commitments under investment projects and government sponsored<lb/> insurance programmes. Implicit contingent liabilities are political or moral obligations of the<lb/> government to intervene, mostly in the event of a crisis or a natural disaster. Governments do not<lb/> recognise these liabilities until a particular event occurs. While the financial system constitutes the<lb/> most common source for these liabilities, it is quite common to see governments covering losses or<lb/> debt obligations of sub-national governments and public corporations. Implicit contingent liabilities<lb/> are difficult to assess, let alone manage in a consistent manner, precisely because of their implicit<lb/> nature.<lb/> This study adopts a central government viewpoint while setting a dividing line between the two<lb/> categories of contingent liabilities. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the categorisation of direct and contingent liabilities<lb/> of different levels of government and private sector as contingent liabilities of &quot; central government &quot; .<lb/> To give an example, direct debt obligations of local governments or public corporations are implicit<lb/> contingent liabilities of central government, as central government might have to cover these<lb/> obligations in case of failure of these public bodies. Likewise, central governments might assume in<lb/> times of crisis and disasters, non-guaranteed debt of private banks, large corporations or even<lb/> households. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> also shows how wide the scope of implicit contingent liabilities is for central<lb/> government, as it can encompass all financial commitments of the public sector and theoretically even<lb/> that of the private sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>, which we define as liabilities based on<lb/> contracts through which the government assumes the whole or part of the credit risk of a loan<lb/> extended to another party. In case the borrower fails to fulfil its obligations, the lender can turn to the<lb/> government as guarantor and claim payment of interest and/or principal. In this study, the term<lb/> &quot; government credit guarantee &quot; refers to all types of guarantees covering debt service obligations of<lb/> beneficiaries and, as such, includes government guarantees issued for bonds as well. 7,8 However, this<lb/> study categorised credit guarantees issued within the framework of PPP projects within a different<lb/> group to be discussed subsequently. In this conceptual framework, government credit guarantees<lb/> comprise:<lb/>  individual guarantees issued for public institutions like public corporations or local<lb/> governments, public or private development banks; mostly for their investment financing<lb/> operations<lb/>  programme guarantees provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on<lb/> housing loans, student loans, export and SME credits<lb/></p>

			<figure> guarantees extended to bonds issued by commercial banks<lb/>  individual bond guarantees in countries where public institutions borrow from capital<lb/> markets.<lb/> The second group consists of contingent liabilities arising from projects realised under PPP<lb/> models. PPPs are long term contractual arrangements between the government and a private partner<lb/> whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the associated risks<lb/> (OECD, 2012). Here the coverage is the government liabilities in the PPPs, which are explicit and<lb/> contingent. In this context, PPP contingent liabilities include:<lb/>  financial guarantees in the form of credit and refinancing guarantees<lb/>  revenue guarantees<lb/>  exchange rate guarantees<lb/>  termination payment commitments<lb/>  debt assumption commitments<lb/>  sub-sovereign creditworthiness guarantees.<lb/> The third sub-group consists of government sponsored insurance programmes. Here, the<lb/> scope again is explicit commitments by central government, which are also contingent upon some<lb/> future events. Therefore, fully private insurance programmes are outside the scope of this study.<lb/> Government sponsored insurance programmes are:<lb/></figure>

			<p> deposit insurance programmes funded or explicitly supported by the government<lb/>  other government insurance programmes such as disaster risk insurance and terrorism<lb/> insurance.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are other sources of explicit contingent liabilities not covered by this study, such as legal<lb/> claims against government, uncalled capital commitments to international organisations or country<lb/> specific forms of government contractual liabilities carrying uncertainties.<lb/> Implicit contingent liabilities, on the other hand, are much wider in scope. As such, their<lb/> management requires an orchestrated effort among various institutions and players in the economy.<lb/> When realised however, their negative effects on the governments&apos; fiscal positions are more<lb/> significant than explicit contingent liabilities, as the recent global financial crisis has shown. Thus, it is<lb/> important for debt managers to have the necessary risk awareness about implicit contingent liabilities,<lb/> as well as other sources of fiscal risks.<lb/></p>

			<p>The present report is informed by results from the OECD Committee on Financial Markets<lb/> (CMF) workstream covering both explicit and implicit financial sector guarantees, although it takes<lb/> the specific and somewhat narrower perspective of a public debt and risk manager and focuses on<lb/> explicit contingent liabilities only. As part of this workstream, the CMF has numerous studies on the<lb/> benefits and costs of the extension of various financial safety net aspects, including on competition,<lb/> incentives and risk-taking and taxpayer liabilities (see e.g. OECD, 2011 and Schich and Kim, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.<lb/> Global crisis and contingent liabilities<lb/></head>

			<p>It has been more than eight years since the onset of the global financial crisis. Policy responses of<lb/> governments aimed at mitigating the negative effects of the crisis especially over financial markets<lb/> have resulted in sizable increases in government debt and further deteriorations in fiscal balances, 9<lb/> Concern continues over the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis, impairing efforts to restore<lb/> confidence among investors, financial intermediaries and households; and putting downward pressure<lb/> on global economic growth.<lb/> Progress achieved in reducing fiscal imbalances in OECD countries has not been at sufficient<lb/> levels to contain the public debt burden. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows central government marketable gross debt for<lb/> different country groupings. Debt accumulation is higher in G7 countries affected most seriously by<lb/> the crisis, while there is also an important increase in the OECD area of approximately 30% during the<lb/> period 2007-2014. 10<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Central government marketable gross debt in OECD countries<lb/> Percentage of GDP<lb/> Source: OECD (2014), OECD Sovereign Borrowing Outlook 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/sov_b_outlk-2014-en<lb/></figure>

			<p>Large-scale support of governments to the financial sector was a characteristic of the post crisis<lb/> environment, taking various forms including unlimited coverages for deposits, capital injections, asset<lb/> purchases and finally yet importantly, guarantees on bank bonds. The policy responses have been<lb/> effective in restoring financial stability and preventing bank runs, while the interventions with public<lb/> funds have had significant repercussions for both markets and the government balance sheets.<lb/> Sovereign guarantees issued for banks&apos; funding have been initially considered as a reflection of<lb/> the implicit contingent liabilities of governments towards the financial sector. However, the<lb/> prolongation of these explicit guarantee programmes in Europe and the US has raised discussions over<lb/> their possible negative impacts on the risk and pricing mechanisms in financial markets 11 . The<lb/> issuances of these government-backed bonds reached very high levels during 2009-2010 (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Gross issuance of bank bonds in the euro area, the UK and the US<lb/> Billions of Euro equivalents<lb/> Source: Grande G, et al. (2011), &quot; Public Guarantees on Bank Bonds: Effectiveness and Distortions &quot; ,<lb/> www.oecd.org/finance/financial-markets/49200208.pdf<lb/></figure>

			<p>On the other hand, financial sector distress has created important effects on global capital<lb/> movements and investment channels. Regulatory and restrictive measures taken to protect the<lb/> financial system have led to a decrease in the risk appetite and willingness of banks to provide<lb/> financing for infrastructure. The resulting financing gap has become an important issue for both<lb/> developed and developing countries. In this environment, government guarantees, mostly taking the<lb/> form of credit guarantees, have continued to be important tools of credit enhancement in infrastructure<lb/> finance. On the other hand, in the framework of the PPP model of procurement, governments have<lb/> increasingly resorted to the financial and other guarantees in order to increase the governments&apos; share<lb/> in project risks and thereby ensuring the projects&apos; &quot; bankability 12 &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>The global crisis has posed significant troubles for the small and medium-sized enterprises<lb/> (SMEs) as well. Work by the OECD 13 reveals that access to finance and lending conditions<lb/> deteriorated for the SMEs after the crisis, especially during the period 2007-2010, generally<lb/> accompanied by modest or no growth in credit volumes. Responding to these developments,<lb/> governments designed new SME guarantee programmes generally in the form of credit guarantees<lb/> provided under special programmes or expanded the existing ones in order to boost SME financing in<lb/> the post-crisis environment 14 . There have been changes in the total amount of guarantee funds, the<lb/> share of the loans guaranteed or the number and types of eligible firms aimed at increasing the<lb/> government support. In addition, these programmes included some new elements or new instruments<lb/> over the traditional guarantee programmes (OECD, 2013). In general, the main objective of these<lb/> programmes has been to enhance the SMEs&apos; access to credit, especially to bank lending.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3 presents the increase in the level of contingent liabilities in the European context for the<lb/> period 2007-2014. The data illustrate that in both the Euro Area (EA19) and the EU as a whole<lb/> (EU28), there was significant increase in the stock of contingent liabilities in 2008 and 2009, before<lb/> the gradual decrease in 2010 and 2011. The peak in 2009 reflects the large exposures of the European<lb/> governments under the financial sector support programmes (in the form of guarantee schemes), and<lb/> the subsequent decrease is largely the result of decreased exposures in Germany, Ireland, the<lb/> Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Eurostat, 2015).<lb/> Figure 3. Level of contingent liabilities in the euro area and the EU 28 (2007-2014)<lb/> Percentage of GDP<lb/> PART 2. THE ROLE OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGERS<lb/> IN CONTINGENT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT<lb/> The first section of this part presents the summary results of the OECD survey to provide readers<lb/> with an overview of public debt managers&apos; involvement in contingent liability management across<lb/> countries. This part then analyses three categories of contingent liabilities; government credit<lb/> guarantees, contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and government sponsored insurance programmes,<lb/> and includes discussions on these policy areas from a PDM perspective.<lb/> 2.1. Summary of the OECD survey results<lb/> The OECD Bond Market and Public Debt Management Unit conducted a survey on the role of<lb/> public debt managers in contingent liability management in late 2013 among 34 OECD Countries and<lb/> 2 non-OECD Countries (Brazil and South Africa). The survey questions were sent through e-mails to<lb/> the authorities of DMOs and 31 OECD and 2 non-OECD countries responded to the survey.<lb/> According to the survey results, out of the 33 DMOs, 22 indicated that they have some role in the<lb/> management of contingent liabilities. Figure 4 illustrates this result as a percentage.<lb/> Figure 4. The role of DMOs in contingent liability management<lb/></figure>

			<p>The survey also provided information on the involvement of DMOs in contingent liabilities by<lb/> the type of liabilities (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The results indicate that the government credit guarantees is the<lb/> category of contingent liabilities with which DMOs mostly engage. Programme guarantees -also<lb/> included within the category of credit guarantees in this paper – government sponsored insurance<lb/> programmes and the PPP guarantees are areas that a majority of DMOs participated in the survey do<lb/> not assume responsibilities at the management level.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results also provided insights into the types of roles DMOs play in different areas of<lb/> contingent liability management – measurement, monitoring and reporting. Monitoring and reporting<lb/> roles of DMOs are more prominent when compared to the measurement in case of the credit<lb/> guarantees. For the other types of contingent liabilities, the number of DMOs carrying these three<lb/> functions is much less. The involvement of DMOs in the measurement, monitoring and reporting of<lb/> contingent liabilities is slightly higher in every category when compared with their &quot; responsibility in<lb/> management &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<p>As regards to the question about the possible effect of the global financial crisis on the role of the<lb/> DMOs in contingent liability management; 13 countries mentioned some change in their role<lb/> following the global crisis, and 9 of these countries linked this change to the support provided to the<lb/> financial sector after the crisis (<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. The effect of the global financial crisis on the role of DMOs<lb/> To summarise, the main findings of the OECD survey on the role of public debt managers in<lb/> contingent liability management are:<lb/>  Around two-thirds of the DMOs responding to the survey have some role in contingent<lb/> liability management.<lb/>  Government credit guarantees is the sub-category of contingent liabilities that the DMOs<lb/> most actively engage.<lb/></figure>

			<p> Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs and the government sponsored insurance<lb/> programmes are the areas the public debt managers are not involved in management while a<lb/> relatively small number of DMOs perform functions of measurement, monitoring and<lb/> reporting in these areas as well.<lb/></p>

			<p> From the perspective of public debt managers, the effect of the global financial crisis on their<lb/> contingent liability management practices was largely through their increasing role in the<lb/> financial sector support programmes initiated within the crisis environment.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the following sections, policy frameworks of government credit guarantees, contingent<lb/> liabilities arising from PPPs and government insurance programmes will be discussed with their<lb/> implications for public debt managers.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Government credit guarantees<lb/></head>

			<p>Government credit guarantees are the liabilities based on contracts through which the government<lb/> assumes the whole or part of the credit risk of a loan extended to or a bond issued by another party. In<lb/> this study, the term refers to the guarantees covering debt service obligations of the beneficiaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Government credit guarantees are the most widely used explicit contingent liabilities in many<lb/> countries and the results of the survey strongly supports this finding. Traditionally, this group<lb/> consisted mainly of the individual guarantees provided for public institutions like public corporations<lb/> or local governments, and for public or private development banks, mostly in the framework of their<lb/> investment financing operations. In many developing countries, access to foreign financing sources by<lb/> public institutions has been possible through the government guarantees provided on their foreign<lb/></p>

			<p>loans. The alternative to these government guarantees is the on-lending, in which case, the government<lb/> borrows directly from the lenders and on-lends the funds under the same or different terms to the<lb/> beneficiary institutions by means of a separate agreement 15 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Programme or umbrella guarantees – labelled as programme loan guarantees in the survey-are<lb/> usually provided for large groups of beneficiaries, as in guarantees on housing loans, student loans,<lb/> export credits and the credits for SMEs. These guarantees are also debt service guarantees issued by<lb/> the central governments. In most cases, programme guarantees are run by specialised agencies or<lb/> institutions, as in the case of credit guarantee funds for SMEs or export credit agencies (ECAs) for the<lb/> export credits. Considering the large number of beneficiaries involved, individual guarantee<lb/> applications are dealt with within the programme parameters at the agency level, rather than at the<lb/> central government level (such as the ministry of finance or treasury).<lb/> Guarantees issued by the governments for the bonds of the commercial banks in response to the<lb/> financial crisis can also be evaluated as some form of government credit guarantees. As these<lb/> guarantees were in the form of contractual guarantees, they are by definition explicit, irrespective of<lb/> whether they were issued on some (until then) implicit commitments. 16 .<lb/> From the government&apos;s perspective, motivation for credit guarantee issuance is a function of its<lb/> political and economic priorities and might change over time, depending on the developments in the<lb/> domestic market and at the global level. For example, when boosting real sector development becomes<lb/> a priority, guaranteed SME credits might be formulated, or in a financial crisis environment, bond<lb/> guarantees are brought to the table to ease the banking sector distress. The main objective of the<lb/> government in using credit guarantees as a financial instrument is, in general terms, to provide<lb/> incentives for the market to finance certain institutions, activities or projects. By taking over the credit<lb/> risk of the borrower, access to more funding from the lenders or investors is assured or the terms of the<lb/> financing is ameliorated. Thus, the principal rationale is the same in different sub-categories of credit<lb/> guarantees. For credit guarantees to be economically justified, however, they must bring advantages<lb/> that outweigh these drawbacks. Each proposed guarantee (or programme) has to be evaluated on its<lb/> own merits, including a careful evaluation of alternative solutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Role of public debt managers<lb/></head>

			<p>The results of the survey show that compared to other forms of contingent liabilities, the area of<lb/> government credit guarantees is the one with which debt managers are the most actively engaged.<lb/> Public debt managers are involved in different phases of guarantee issuance; from assessing the credit<lb/> guarantee proposals, to monitoring and managing the credit guarantee portfolios and programmes. The<lb/> survey responses also indicate that DMOs were responsible for the management of the financial sector<lb/> guarantee programmes, initiated in the European countries during the global financial crisis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Assessment of credit guarantee proposals<lb/></head>

			<p>In case of individual (non-programme) credit guarantees, the criteria to be met by the applying<lb/> institutions should be set clearly thereby the initial assessment for the guarantee eligibility becomes an<lb/> easy task. This can be done by the front or mid office of DMO, or the related department of<lb/> Treasury/Ministry of Finance, where the application is submitted, or the sponsoring ministry in more<lb/> decentralised jurisdictions.<lb/></p>

			<p>More importantly, assessment of a credit guarantee at the application stage requires a further<lb/> quantitative analysis of the proposed guarantee at hand, revealing its potential costs and risks to the<lb/> government. Ideally, the net cost/net benefit should be quantified through a cost-benefit analysis of the<lb/> guarantee proposal though it is often difficult to quantify the benefits of a guarantee. In this regard, the<lb/> guarantee should be valued and priced ex ante based on its expected and actual (mostly administrative)<lb/> costs and risks, based on different contingent liability measures, with two initial purposes:<lb/>  inform the political decision-making body about the costs and risks of the guarantee before a<lb/> decision is made for its issuance<lb/>  determine the level of fee to be charged from the beneficiary.<lb/></p>

			<p>Operationally, these two analyses can be done in one stage or in two separate stages. The<lb/> quantitative analysis should inform and supplement the eventually political decision to be taken by the<lb/> legislature, cabinet or the minister, depending on the legal framework in place in a country. This<lb/> information should also be provided in a way to enable the decision-maker to compare between the<lb/> credit guarantee with other instruments like direct lending or subsidies in terms of its costs. For<lb/> example, the risk assessment conducted by the State Guarantee Fund (SGF) of Iceland, which is the<lb/> body within the Government Debt Management division of Central Bank, is submitted to the<lb/> Parliament for the latter to decide if a financial subsidy should be provided instead of a guarantee.<lb/> Ultimately, the policymaking body decides whether to issue the guarantee or not. A guarantee can be<lb/> issued for political reasons or certain policy purposes even when the cost of a guarantee is relatively<lb/> high.<lb/> According to the results of the OECD Survey, there are differences among countries in decision-<lb/>making frameworks for issuing credit guarantees, but political decision-making supported by a<lb/> quantitative assessment/evaluation of guarantee terms exists in many countries (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Source: OECD 2013 Survey on the Role of Debt Managers in Contingent Liability Management<lb/></head>

			<p>In some cases, debt managers are given the mandate to perform the quantitative analysis both at<lb/> the proposal assessment stage of the credit guarantees and for managing the portfolio (which will be<lb/> discussed later). Public debt managers tend to have a broad perspective on government finances, thus<lb/> they may be expected to make unbiased assessments of the costs and risks. Their general financial and<lb/> economic expertise may also be helpful in making the analyses necessary to determine an appropriate<lb/> fee. On the other hand, guarantee pricing requires capacity development in credit and project<lb/> evaluation, and financial statement analysis to calculate default probabilities of institutions. These<lb/> areas of expertise are not searched for in conventional debt management. Conducting default analysis<lb/> of different types of institutions; SOEs, local administrations, public banks, and private investment<lb/> banks, etc. might be challenging and requires a credit risk management function to be established<lb/> within the debt management offices. Hiring credit risk specialists (the SNDO in Sweden and SGF in<lb/> Iceland) or using a tailor-made credit rating model designed by credit risk management specialists<lb/> hired for this purpose (Turkish Treasury) might be considered as other solutions, which enable<lb/> tackling with these challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>In case of programme guarantees, which are usually authorised by the parliaments and involve<lb/> many borrowers, additional aspects should be considered. Common practice is that the governments<lb/> administer these guarantee programmes through specialised agencies and institutions – such as ECAs,<lb/> credit guarantee funds/corporations specialized in SME guarantees, housing funds or agencies<lb/> providing student loan guarantees -rather than assigning their management to DMOs. For efficient<lb/> public financial management, these programmes should have clearly stated objectives and a set of<lb/> rules for granting specific types of guarantees in order to provide the framework in which the unit<lb/> responsible for issuance of these guarantees operates. In countries where centralised risk management<lb/> function is performed by DMOs, the expected costs and risks of these guarantees should be taken into<lb/> account in their overall risk assessment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contract Design<lb/></head>

			<p>Credit guarantee contracts should be formulated in such a way as to clearly identify the scope and<lb/> the terms of the guarantee. Governments limit the guarantees they issue, in time and amount for fiscal<lb/> risk management purposes. For example, &quot; The Guidelines of Borrowing and Risk Management &quot; of<lb/> Denmark stipulates that loan types must be customary, i.e. known and used in the market by reputed<lb/> borrowers and loans must be built up from simple elements that make them transparent (plain vanilla<lb/> products), to be eligible for guarantees &quot; . To give another example, in Swedish legal framework, it is<lb/> envisaged that any guarantee undertaking must include contractual terms that limit the state&apos;s risk and<lb/> ensures that the state has appropriate rights to monitor and control the risk.<lb/> Guarantee agreement between the lender and the government and the loan agreement between the<lb/> lender and the borrower institution are parts of the same financial package. There is usually a third<lb/> agreement (or protocol) between the government and the borrower regulating mostly the fee charging<lb/> and recovery issues. Being as such, the terms of these agreements are highly correlated including<lb/> cross-references to each other. The governments should play an active role in drafting the whole<lb/> package of agreements to ensure proper clauses are in place regarding issues such as:<lb/>  collateral and counter-guarantee (if there are any)<lb/>  guarantee fee and administrative costs to be charged from the borrower<lb/>  rules and procedures to be followed when the guarantee is called<lb/>  financial and information sharing obligations of the lender and the borrower towards the<lb/> government as the guarantor<lb/>  sanctions for noncompliance<lb/>  case of default and the step-in conditions of the government as the guarantor<lb/>  recovery (collection procedures of the government pay-outs), etc.<lb/> The level of involvement of debt managers in the contract design and negotiations depends on the<lb/> institutional framework for the issuance of credit guarantees. In countries where DMO has the<lb/> authority to issue the guarantees, it is naturally involved with the contract drafting, negotiation and<lb/> execution processes as the contracting party. However, in decentralized structures where the<lb/> institutions other than the debt management office/Treasury/Ministry of Finance have the authority to<lb/> issue guarantees such a direct involvement might not be the case.<lb/></p>

			<head>Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio<lb/></head>

			<p>Risk management of the credit guarantee portfolio is a crucial function of governments meaning<lb/> in simple terms, taking necessary measures to monitor and mitigate the fiscal risks posed by the<lb/> already issued guarantees. The most common risk management tools employed by countries are: i) a<lb/> limit or ceiling over the guarantee issuance or stock ii) a contingency reserve fund iii) partial guarantee<lb/> issuance, iv) portfolio monitoring and v) disclosure and reporting.<lb/> Countries with strong capacity in managing risks of their direct debt portfolio are in a better<lb/> position to perform this function over their guaranteed debt portfolio. Well-structured DMOs may<lb/> expand their areas of responsibility to cover the risk management of contingent debt alongside the<lb/> direct debt, enabling an integrated portfolio approach to risk management. For example, the Irish Debt<lb/> Management Agency (NTMA) has evolved from a single function agency to the manager of a<lb/> complex portfolio of public assets and liabilities. Likewise, the New Zealand DMO has recently<lb/> assumed the role to monitor contingent liabilities as part of the responsibility of managing the Crown<lb/> Balance Sheet. In April 2013, the DMO acquired the Balance Sheet Monitoring unit within the New<lb/> Zealand Treasury, playing a more influential role in the management of contingent liabilities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Across the countries applying limits, the types and scope change. Some countries apply an overall<lb/> limit for all the contingent liabilities or even direct debt and contingent debt together, while in some<lb/> others credit guarantees, guarantees issued under certain programmes (like bond guarantees for the<lb/> banks), under the PPP frameworks, etc. are subject to separate ceilings. The scope of the limit might<lb/> apply to the central government issuances or be extended to cover the general government. Some<lb/> examples of guarantee limits are given in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another issue is whether to limit the government&apos;s exposure to the credit risk of a single<lb/> institution, in order to confine the concentration risk of the portfolio. Within well-established<lb/> frameworks where the applications are filtered through a process in which the creditworthiness of the<lb/> applicant is measured and reflected on the guarantee fee, concentration risk might not be regarded as a<lb/> major concern. However, where the incentivising motives of the government is high, issuing large<lb/> amounts of guarantees to certain institutions continuously, even when there is an overall limit might<lb/> increase the risk on the government&apos;s side.<lb/> In jurisdictions where parliamentary approval is a rule for each guarantee issuance, limiting the<lb/> exposure might be less of a concern than in those where guarantee decisions are taken at the<lb/> ministerial, cabinet or separate authority level.<lb/> Limiting the credit risk exposure by limiting the duration of certain guarantee programmes<lb/> designed for exceptional circumstances is also recommended in order to avoid moral hazard and<lb/> prevent the government support through guarantees to be regarded as a normal way of business. For<lb/> example, our survey results indicate that the government guaranteed bank bonds issued after the global<lb/> crisis were designed to be limited in time and amount.<lb/> When the guarantee limit is set and revised annually, the calculation of the limit to be applied for<lb/> the subsequent year should be based on the valuation of the existing guarantee portfolio and the<lb/> pipeline of new projects and activities together. Thus, limit-setting exercise could also be an area of<lb/> involvement for the debt managers, which might be regarded as a side work of guarantee valuation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In countries where reserve fund application exists, its cost effective management can be regarded<lb/> as an area linked with guarantee valuation and portfolio management. Fund management involves<lb/> monitoring the revenues (fees and collections from past pay-outs) and expenses (pay-outs for<lb/> guarantees called) of the fund (generally back offices in debt management offices are good candidates<lb/> to perform this function), managing fund&apos;s assets and calculating the need for budgetary allocations<lb/> when the fund resources fall short.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sweden<lb/></head>

			<p>Each responsible authority keeps a &quot; notional reserve account &quot; at the SNDO. There is an<lb/> unlimited credit linked to each reserve.

In addition, the fees and recoveries are recorded in these nominal accounts and then<lb/> transferred into the central government revenues to decrease the SNDO&apos;s borrowing<lb/> requirement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Turkey<lb/></head>

			<p>Turkish contingency reserve account (called &quot; risk account &quot; ) was established in 2003 at the<lb/> Central Bank with the purpose of funding needs arising from of the credit guarantees. It is an<lb/> actual and off-budgetary fund. The revenues of the fund consist of the collections from past<lb/> pay-outs, guarantee/on-lent fees and interest income. If these revenues do not meet the need<lb/> for undertakings, budgetary allocation for the risk account is utilised.<lb/></p>

			<p>Issuance of partial credit guarantees, i.e. providing guarantee coverage for a percentage of the<lb/> debt service obligations of the beneficiary, is a useful tool to establish a risk sharing arrangement<lb/> between the government and the lender. Through leaving a certain portion of the loan or bond<lb/> uncovered, the government can ensure that lender or investor carry some credit risk as well. Another<lb/> tool to provide partiality is obliging the guarantee beneficiary to provide some part of the total<lb/> financing for the project/activity in question.<lb/> In Turkey, for example, Treasury repayment guarantees are provided for up to 95% of<lb/> repayments of the agreed credit amount. Partial guarantee does not apply to the loans from<lb/> international and regional organisations, foreign government funds, and export credits provided by the<lb/> official export insurance agencies of foreign countries; because of their concessional terms compared<lb/> with commercial loans. In Iceland, this ratio is limited to 75% of the credit amount. In addition, the<lb/> guarantee recipient is required to provide at least 20% of the total financing for the project. In Canada,<lb/> lender-risk sharing is ensured by leaving 15% of the default risk to the lenders.<lb/> Centralisation of the risk management function requires close monitoring of the portfolio, which<lb/> is possible only by having access to information on the existing guarantees. Portfolio monitoring has<lb/> two legs in general:<lb/>  monitoring of the disbursements and payments under the instrument on which the credit<lb/> guarantee is established, and<lb/>  monitoring the financials of the beneficiary to be informed about its financial health in order<lb/> to assess its ability to service guaranteed debt<lb/> Regarding the first one, the survey results show that in many OECD countries DMO is the place<lb/> where data on existing guarantees are gathered even if it is not the issuer of some of those guarantees.<lb/> The debt manager might use the data collected for the following purposes:<lb/>  valuation of the existing portfolio to assess fiscal risks that the central government is<lb/> exposed<lb/>  informing the related bodies or parties (the Parliament, Cabinet, Finance Minister etc. ) about<lb/> such risks<lb/>  using the guarantee information as an input in debt sustainability analysis (see section below)<lb/>  publishing the information on the web-site<lb/>  publishing the information as part of debt management reporting.<lb/> Institutional arrangements should be made in such a way as to make the data collection easier. In<lb/> South Africa, for example, the data on utilisation from the existing guarantees are collated by the<lb/> ALM Division (Credit Risk Directorate) of Treasury to be able to make overall risk based assessments<lb/> of the portfolio and to produce recommendations to the FLC on a quarterly basis. Establishing a<lb/> special guarantee-monitoring unit within DMO might also be useful. In Turkey, there is a separate<lb/> division within the Treasury back office to monitor the guarantee portfolio, while the credit risk<lb/> department in the middle office conducts the portfolio risk assessments. The flow of information to<lb/> this monitoring unit might be direct or indirect through the fiscal reporting, which must be provided by<lb/> the individual agencies to the Ministry of Finance.<lb/> Portfolio monitoring at the central level should ideally cover the whole portfolio of explicit<lb/> contingent liabilities in which the portfolio of credit guarantees constitutes the most prominent part in<lb/> most of the countries.<lb/> As regards to the disclosure and reporting, both quantitative and qualitative information on credit<lb/> guarantees should be disclosed based on their expected costs and in such a way as to give a complete<lb/> picture of the government&apos;s total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and<lb/> budgetary documentation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries have different practices in credit guarantee disclosure and reporting, both as regards to<lb/> the content of the data they disclose and to the forms of disclosure (web reporting, budget document,<lb/> separate periodical report, etc.) (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of the PPP model of procurement for realizing public investment projects has a long<lb/> history as an alternative method to traditional public procurement. The PPP model is described by the<lb/> OECD Principles (2012) as &quot; …long term contractual arrangements between the government and a<lb/> private partner whereby the latter delivers and funds public services using a capital asset, sharing the<lb/> associated risks &quot; 17 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite significant benefits offered by PPPs, most important one being the employment of private<lb/> sector&apos;s efficiency and resources for the purpose of delivering public services, there are yet many<lb/> challenges posed by this model. Most importantly, the complexity of the model necessitates skilful<lb/> management on the public side, which brings about certain capacity building issues.<lb/> The IMF warns that PPPs might entail significant fiscal risks, and draws attention to the actions<lb/> to help mitigate these fiscal risks. Strengthening the legal provisions affecting PPPs, strengthening the<lb/> management and oversight frameworks, achieving full and transparent disclosure of all fiscal risks and<lb/> fully integrating the accounting for and reporting of PPPs in the medium-term budget process are the<lb/> actions that the IMF recommends (IMF 2014).<lb/> Cash flows generated by PPPs are generally quite different from those under the traditional public<lb/> procurement. It might require less public money during the initial years of the contracts, as the<lb/> investment is usually financed by private equity and finance. This perception makes PPPs relatively<lb/> more attractive to governments, especially to ones with fiscal constraints. However, when the fiscal<lb/> costs of the public investment are analysed over the life of the project, the choice for a PPP might not<lb/> be justified.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the rise in the interest for PPPs in recent years is evident, the available data suggests that<lb/> there have been considerable falls in the number of PPP deals in the aftermath of the crisis, especially<lb/> in Europe, as the access to long term private financing sources has become more difficult (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>) 18 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The collapse of the monoline 19 industry due to the crisis, which was important in providing financial<lb/> guarantees over bonds issued by project companies to finance PPPs, and the new and more restrictive<lb/> Basel III capital requirements for banks; are some of the factors exacerbating the limitations of private<lb/> investment finance.<lb/> In recent years, direct and contingent commitments provided by the governments under the PPP<lb/> frameworks have been sought for more and more by the private sector companies and lenders. The<lb/> European Public Private Partnership Expertise Centre (EPEC) confirms this trend by noting &quot; Limited<lb/> liquidity in the PPP financing markets, increased risk aversion of lenders and sponsors and a higher<lb/> cost of capital have led governments to take a more active role in providing direct and indirect<lb/> financial support to PPP programmes. So far, government support has often been provided through<lb/> financing non-government partners&apos; capital costs, granting extensive guarantees to creditors as well as<lb/> agreeing to more generous PPP contract termination clauses &quot; (EPEC, 2010). However, as data<lb/> availability on the contingent commitments embedded in PPP contracts is very limited, it is not<lb/> possible to show this rising trend across countries 20,21 . It should also be noted that the current low<lb/> interest rate environment in the international financial markets is a factor boosting investors&apos;<lb/> willingness to finance PPPs, which might result in a reduced need for the government guarantees<lb/> aiming at credit enhancement in the coming years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Types of contingent liabilities in PPPs<lb/></head>

			<p>For the purposes of this report, PPP contingent liabilities cover those contingent commitments,<lb/> which are based on contracts 22 signed by the central government institutions for PPPs. The non-<lb/>contractual or implicit PPP liabilities, which are materialized mostly when the politically important<lb/> projects are bailed out by the governments, or when the governments have to renegotiate PPP<lb/> contracts, are outside the scope of this report.<lb/> On the other hand, direct fiscal commitments of governments under the PPPs; like up-front<lb/> capital contributions or availability payments of governments committed during the life of the project<lb/> are not covered because these are not contingent but direct liabilities of the governments. However, it<lb/> is important to acknowledge that these long-term direct fiscal commitments are also important sources<lb/> of fiscal risk and should be monitored closely for ensuring fiscal sustainability.<lb/> Within this context, the main contingent liabilities under PPPs are:<lb/>  credit and refinancing guarantees extended to the project companies under which the<lb/> government guarantees the lenders that it will service their debt if the PPP company fails to<lb/> do so.<lb/>  revenue guarantees, where the government guarantees the project company a certain level of<lb/> usage of the services to be provided by the latter.<lb/>  exchange rate guarantees, which means the government assumes the exchange risk of the<lb/> project company, usually when the project&apos;s main cash flows are denominated in a foreign<lb/> currency.<lb/>  termination payments, which are government commitments to pay the project company a<lb/> certain amount in case the contract terminates prematurely, where the principle is that this<lb/> amount corresponds to the value of the project assets, but in some cases the government<lb/> commits to pay a certain portion of the debt outstanding to the lenders<lb/>  debt assumption commitments, where the government agrees to assume the debt obligations<lb/> of the project company in case the PPP contract is terminated. Compared to the terminations<lb/> payments, the debt assumption commitments are towards the lenders, not the project<lb/> company.<lb/>  guarantees extended to the commitments provided by non-sovereigns (non-sovereign<lb/> creditworthiness guarantees), which aim at increasing the creditworthiness of commitments<lb/> provided by non-central government entities.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> provides examples of these various types of contingent liabilities by the countries that use<lb/> them in their PPP contracts.<lb/> It is also useful to distinguish between different layers of direct fiscal commitments and<lb/> guarantees provided under PPPs (<ref type="biblio">Aslan and Duarte, 2014</ref>). Grantor or procuring public institutions<lb/> 22 The main contract signed under the PPP models is the implementation contract between the procuring<lb/> institution and the project company, which is usually called &quot; the PPP contract &quot; . There are other<lb/> contracts and sub-contracts regulating mainly the credit, hedging, insurance, construction, operation<lb/> and maintenance issues signed between the related PPP players.<lb/> can themselves provide some forms of direct fiscal commitments or guarantees to the project<lb/> companies or the creditors for various project risks, depending on the authority given to them by the<lb/> domestic PPP legislations. The second layer of guarantees are provided by the central government<lb/> authority/financial authority (ministries of finance or national treasuries in most cases) to support the<lb/> first level of commitments or provide additional guarantee coverage for certain risks. Aslan and<lb/> Duarte highlight the importance of ensuring coordination between these two levels of institutions<lb/> considering that the implementing institutions would be more prone to take risks to accomplish their<lb/> investment agenda than the finance ministry/treasury, which would be more cautious about the impact<lb/> of these contingent liabilities on the central government budget and debt sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is important to note that some of the guarantees provided by the EPEC members in PPPs have<lb/> been initiated in response to the global crisis, such as the debt instrument in France, refinancing<lb/> guarantee in Belgium and loan guarantees in Portugal (EPEC 2011).<lb/></p>

			<head>PPP Governance<lb/></head>

			<p>OECD Principles for Public Governance of Public Private Partnerships 23 (2012) maps out the key<lb/> players and their responsibilities in PPPs (<ref type="table">Table 9</ref>). The OECD recommends that there should be a<lb/> body at the central government level approving the PPPs, and this approval decision should be taken<lb/> based on sufficient information on the costs and risks of the project. OECD also advises that in order<lb/> to avoid conflict of interest, the unit promoting the PPP and the unit approving the investment decision<lb/> should be separated. The approving agency should have an understanding of the government&apos;s fiscal<lb/> situation and an interest in maintaining prudent fiscal policy.<lb/> Institutional set-ups for PPP governance differ widely across countries. In some countries there is<lb/> no PPP unit performing the functions that are recommended by the OECD. 24 PPPs are long-term<lb/> contracts calling for strong project management and monitoring skills not only within the private<lb/> parties but also on the side of governments. As part of this broader context, the monitoring and<lb/> management of long term PPP contingent commitments should also be an area of concern for the<lb/> governments and be dealt with at the central government level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implications for public debt management<lb/></head>

			<p>From a public debt manager&apos;s perspective, explicit PPP guarantees of various forms listed above<lb/> are not different from the government credit guarantees discussed in the previous section, in terms of<lb/> their relationship with and potential impacts on public debt and central government budget. However,<lb/> the OECD Survey results indicate that public debt managers are much less involved in the<lb/> management of PPP guarantees than they are with the credit guarantees. Among the 18 countries that<lb/> responded to the question &quot; Is the DMO responsible in the management of the PPP explicit contingent<lb/> liabilities at any level? &quot; only Turkey responded &quot; Yes &quot; . This distance observed in practice between the<lb/> PPP contingent liabilities and public debt managers is difficult to justify. Indeed, there is policy areas<lb/> in which the debt managers might be effectively involved.<lb/></p>

			<p> recording and budgeting of the payments<lb/> and collections from the existing<lb/> guarantees in line with international<lb/> standards and best practices<lb/>  periodic valuation of the guarantees<lb/> already provided, which is necessary for<lb/> establishing if the project&apos;s value for<lb/> money is maintained<lb/>  monitoring any major changes in<lb/> project&apos;s risks that might have impact on<lb/> the existing guarantees<lb/>  disclosing qualitative and quantitative<lb/> information on the guarantees through<lb/> debt management reports and/or<lb/> budgetary documentation<lb/> Regardless of the issuer institution of the PPP guarantees, the effective management and<lb/> mitigation of fiscal risks arising from the existing PPP portfolio calls for the following functions to be<lb/> performed by the related government units:<lb/></p>

			<head> undertaking scenario analysis and stress tests<lb/></head>

			<p> providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse fiscal<lb/> sustainability of central government over medium to long term<lb/>  providing estimates of expected and maximum losses from the portfolio to analyse debt<lb/> sustainability of central government over medium to long term<lb/>  applying ceilings on contingent liabilities from PPPs to promote fiscal discipline.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transparency<lb/></head>

			<p>Transparency of contingent liabilities increases the likelihood that these liabilities are taken on<lb/> for sound reasons and it helps eliminate the bias toward them. Transparency is particularly important<lb/> in the framework of PPPs, as the governments might be inclined more towards the PPPs if the costs<lb/> and risks are managed in a non-transparent way.<lb/> Raising the awareness of the long-term fiscal impact of PPPs is important for governments and<lb/> they can disclose information on PPPs regardless of the complexity of their budgetary, accounting, and<lb/> statistical standards. This information could include supplementary statistics that provide medium-and<lb/> long-term forecasts of PPP spending and revenue, descriptions of the contracts and their fiscal costs<lb/> and risks, and the contracts themselves (<ref type="biblio">Funke, K et al., 2013</ref>). Contingent liabilities under PPPs, in<lb/> this context, are among the critical information to be disclosed as major source of fiscal risk.<lb/> DMOs can work together with the central budget authority in data consolidation, forecasting and<lb/> reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or include this information in their debt reporting.<lb/> The degree of the public debt managers&apos; involvement in disclosure is a function of the PPP legislative<lb/> frameworks in countries, which determine their access to the related data.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.<lb/> Government sponsored insurance programmes<lb/></head>

			<p>Government insurance programmes are another major source of explicit contingent liabilities.<lb/> They are special programmes providing insurance coverage for low frequency but high impact events<lb/> like bank failures, floods, earthquakes, terrorist activities, etc., where the form and amount of<lb/> government support or intervention are pre-described explicitly by law. Not surprisingly, these<lb/> insurance programme areas coincide with the sources of large implicit contingent liabilities for<lb/> governments; financial system, terrorist activities, catastrophic events and environmental disasters. In<lb/> other words, government sponsored insurance programmes should be considered as ex ante financial<lb/> measures aimed at increasing governments&apos; readiness for and protection against losses expected from<lb/> certain disastrous events.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some insurance schemes, government plays directly the role of an insurance provider (self-<lb/>insurance) while in others it might choose to purchase insurance from the private insurance companies<lb/> (market insurance). In the latter case, the event risk is transferred to the private sector while the risk<lb/> premiums are paid out of the government budget without creating any explicit contingent liability but<lb/> direct commitments. However, there are various different forms of government insurance schemes<lb/> falling between self-insurance and market insurance, depending on the source of risk, availability of<lb/> market for providing insurance against this risk and the policy objectives of the government.<lb/></p>

			<head>Government deposit insurance<lb/></head>

			<p>Government deposit insurance is one of the most important and widely applied mechanisms in<lb/> this category 28,29 . Major purposes of the deposit insurance systems are, to offer consumer protection<lb/> and to reduce the risks of bank runs in case of banking failures, runs that can trigger systemic crises.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 11</ref> summarizes the main characteristics of deposit insurance systems in the OECD<lb/> countries based on the database provided by <ref type="biblio">Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2014)</ref>. In almost all of the OECD<lb/> countries, there exist explicit deposit insurance systems (the exceptions are Israel and New Zealand).<lb/> In terms of the administration of the deposit insurance system, the common practice is to have a<lb/> separate legal entity. This entity is administered publicly, privately or jointly in different country<lb/> cases. The funding source of the system is private in most of the OECD countries; the exceptions<lb/> being Australia and Chile which have government funded insurance systems and in Portugal where the<lb/> system is funded jointly between the public and private sources. In most OECD countries, deposit<lb/> insurance systems are run through a fund into which the premiums paid by the banks are pooled ex<lb/> ante (there are several countries with ex post structures). In other words, the deposit insurance system<lb/> is financed by the banks themselves 30 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The insurance coverage provided might be limited based on deposit types, amounts or eligible<lb/> institutions or unlimited covering all the deposits within the banking system. In some cases, the<lb/> insurance coverage is set to be unlimited temporarily, as was the case in some OECD countries during<lb/> the global crisis. Governments sometimes envisage in legislation some contingency plans even if the<lb/> source of funding in the deposit insurance system is not government, considering the possibility that<lb/> the deposit fund reserves available might fall short during the times of bank failures. This &quot; backstop &quot;<lb/> might take the form of pre-approved credit lines from the Treasury, or the institution managing the<lb/> deposit fund might issue bonds or receive loans guaranteed by the government.<lb/> 28 Some authors classify deposit insurance among financial guarantees rather than under insurance schemes,<lb/> considering that these are guarantees covering banks&apos; payment obligations towards their depositors in<lb/></p>

			<head>Implications for public debt management<lb/></head>

			<p>The ability and credibility of governments, especially of the ones with relatively less fiscal space,<lb/> in meeting their promises under the deposit insurance systems is an issue, because the maximum<lb/> exposure loss (cash flow at risk) is relatively high considering the level of covered deposits within the<lb/> financial system. Country experiences suggest that during systemic banking crisis, deposit insurance<lb/> fund resources coming from the banks themselves usually fall short of the arising funding needs,<lb/> compelling governments to deploy central government resources and debt financing, mostly in the<lb/> form of bond issuances by DMOs or by the deposit insurance institutions, which are backed<lb/> (guaranteed) by the central government.<lb/></p>

			<p>The fiscal costs of systemic banking crisis might be so high that it takes years of collaboration<lb/> between the debt management offices and the deposit insurance institution to pay out or roll over the<lb/> related financial liabilities. In this regard, Mexico is a good example: the 1995 crisis left the deposit<lb/> insurance institution (IPAB) with a stock of liabilities funded from the markets through bond issuances<lb/> guaranteed by the Mexican Congress. The fiscal burden of the Tequila crisis still continues and<lb/> necessitates coordination between the DMO and the IPAB in the bond markets 20 years after the<lb/> crisis. Turkey is yet another example of such an experience in which case it took almost 10 years to<lb/> redeem the securities issued to back the deposit insurance system.<lb/> The involvement by the public debt managers in this governance area is rather limited given the<lb/> special expertise and mandate required for their management. In the survey results among the 18<lb/> DMOs who responded, it is only the SNDO having a mandate in the management of government<lb/> deposit insurance programmes. On the other hand, the SNDO performs this function separately from<lb/> its PDM functions. However, public debt managers can work with deposit insurance manager<lb/> institution and financial system regulators in the field of contingent liabilities under deposit insurance<lb/> systems to promote strategic risk taking and risk mitigation. In this context, the following key policies<lb/> can be suggested:<lb/>  clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government&apos;s role within the<lb/> system – as insurer/guarantor/liquidity provider<lb/>  effective reserve management (in ex ante fund structures) with risk based premium systems<lb/>  effective and regular coordination and consultation with deposit insurance managers and<lb/> financial system regulators over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other insurance programmes in which governments are involved are mainly disaster risk<lb/> insurance programmes designed for losses from catastrophic events and natural disasters 31 . During the<lb/> last decades, the incidence of catastrophic events, especially those related with climate has increased<lb/> steadily causing large fiscal costs for governments. In parallel with this increase, governments&apos;<lb/> involvement in the catastrophe risk insurance programmes, especially in developed countries, has<lb/> amplified.<lb/> In several countries, governments are involved in insurance programmes mainly due to lack of<lb/> insurance coverage in the private market or unavailability of affordable insurance for the related<lb/> segments of the society. Governments that experienced large-scale catastrophes with high disaster<lb/> relief costs in the past are also more prone to design insurance frameworks.<lb/> Insurance programmes are one of the instruments providing ex ante financing solutions for<lb/> governments in disaster risk management. Other ex-ante financial sources are budget contingencies,<lb/> reserve funds, contingent debt facilities and catastrophe bonds; while ex-post sources include donor<lb/> assistance, budgetary reallocations, domestic and external credits and tax incomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Governments need to analyse their risk bearing capacity before engaging in such insurance<lb/> programmes. This analysis includes assessments of government&apos;s fiscal position, budgetary flexibility,<lb/> public debt sustainability, as well as the ability to have access to financing resources in the post<lb/> disaster conditions. This exercise is combined with the technical assessment of the probability of event<lb/> occurring. If the disaster risk is minor and the risk bearing capacity is high, ex post solutions would be<lb/> more rational for some governments (G20/OECD, 2012) 32 .<lb/></p>

			<p>When the insurance is deemed necessary, governments can get involved in this process in various<lb/> ways. The appropriate role for the government would depend on the programme features, policy<lb/> objectives, and the extent to which the government plans to assume the costs of the disaster risk<lb/> covered.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of self-insurance (direct insurer) solutions, public reserve fund applications are quite<lb/> common practice, which are similar to contingency reserve funds discussed under the government<lb/> credit guarantees section. National Calamity Fund in Colombia, Environmental Contingency Fund of<lb/> U.S., and Natural Disaster Fund in Mexico are yet several examples of many. Although they are<lb/> regarded as useful risk mitigation tools, as in the case of actual funds for credit guarantees, there is a<lb/> cost attached to holding a cash fund with the expectation of a future natural disaster.<lb/> Governments are also involved in insurance programmes by explicitly guaranteeing a part of the<lb/> liabilities to occur under the programme. These guarantees usually take the form of backstop<lb/> arrangements under deposit insurance, or guarantees provided under PPPs, in the sense that they are<lb/> forms of risk sharing with the private sector while increasing the credibility of the system in covering<lb/> the anticipated future losses. There might be a layered approach with private insurers or funds, i.e.<lb/> damages are covered by the market until a certain threshold amount for the government guarantee to<lb/> be called.<lb/></p>

			<head>PART 3. SUMMARY OF POLICY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS<lb/> Policy conclusions and recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper examines the role of public debt managers in the following three categories of<lb/> contingent liabilities and included several recommendations under each section. Although intended for<lb/> the public debt managers, in countries where DMOs do not have any roles and responsibilities in fiscal<lb/> risk management in general and contingent liability management in particular these recommendations<lb/> might be relevant for other government units.<lb/></p>

			<head>Government credit guarantees<lb/></head>

			<p>This study included examples from the implementation frameworks showing that the DMOs are<lb/> involved in the management of government credit guarantees at different stages including the<lb/> assessment of guarantee proposals, contract design and the risk management of the credit guarantee<lb/> portfolio. The main recommendations of this study are the following:<lb/> -Costs and risks of the credit guarantee should be calculated to inform the decision-making<lb/> authorities accordingly.<lb/> -Programme loan guarantees should have clearly-stated objectives and a set of rules or a code<lb/> of conduct for granting.<lb/> -Fees corresponding to at least the expected cost of each guarantee should be charged from the<lb/> beneficiaries.<lb/> -The terms of the credit guarantee contracts should be drafted in a way as to clearly define and<lb/> limit the guarantee in time and scope.<lb/> -A ceiling on the stock or new issuances of credit guarantees might be helpful to promote fiscal<lb/> discipline, limit the fiscal risk exposure and direct the policy-makers towards prioritisation<lb/> among the applications.<lb/> -Contingency reserve funds, whether actual or notional, is a useful tool to increase the<lb/> governments&apos; ability to cover possible future losses and monitor their financial position vis-à-<lb/>vis the existing guarantees.<lb/> -Both quantitative and qualitative information on credit guarantees should be disclosed based<lb/> on their expected cost and in such a way as to give a complete picture of the government&apos;s<lb/> total financial position, both as part of debt management reporting and budgetary<lb/> documentation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contingent liabilities arising from PPPs<lb/></head>

			<p>The country practices in the area of PPP contingent liabilities revealed that DMOs are generally<lb/> not involved in their management. However, based on the OECD/G20 recommendations for effective<lb/> PPP governance, certain functions to be performed by the central government units were discussed. In<lb/> this context, this study recommends that public debt managers can well work together with other<lb/> government units in the field of PPP guarantees. The main recommendations in this area are the<lb/> following:<lb/>  The PPP fiscal risks can be mitigated through strengthening the regulatory frameworks,<lb/> strengthening the management and oversight frameworks, increasing transparency and<lb/> integrating PPPs into the medium term budget process (IMF, 2014).<lb/>  As is the case for the government credit guarantees, a central government unit should analyse<lb/> the PPP guarantees to inform the decision-making authorities on the associated costs and<lb/> risks.<lb/></p>

			<p> Guarantee valuation should be considered as a critical component of the PPP decision<lb/> making since the guarantees change the risk allocation between the public and the private<lb/> partner.<lb/></p>

			<p> Contingent liabilities under the PPP contracts should be centrally monitored at the central<lb/> government level for the purpose of ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<p> DMOs can work together with the central budget authority and the PPP units in data<lb/> consolidation, forecasting and reporting practices on the PPP contingent liabilities; or<lb/> include this information in their debt reporting.<lb/></p>

			<head>Government sponsored insurance schemes<lb/></head>

			<p>Government deposit insurance systems and other government sponsored insurance programmes<lb/> were discussed with examples from countries. The study showed that these insurance programmes<lb/> comprise explicit contingent commitments on the side of governments. The degree of the DMOs&apos;<lb/> involvement in these special expertise areas was also quite low, based on the survey results. However,<lb/> the following recommendations for the public debt managers were provided:<lb/>  Stability in the financial markets is crucial for public debt managers and a healthy banking<lb/> system that runs with effective prudential regulations, and supervision, with a credible and<lb/> well managed deposit insurance framework would contribute to this end.<lb/></p>

			<p> Public debt managers are recommended to be well informed of the contingent liabilities<lb/> under the government sponsored insurance systems.<lb/></p>

			<p> Clear legislative frameworks defining the scope and nature of government&apos;s role within the<lb/> insurance programmes are recommended.<lb/></p>

			<p> Regular coordination between deposit and other insurance managers and public debt<lb/> managers over the fiscal risks arising from the financial system are considered useful.<lb/></p>

			<p> Analyses involving finance ministries and DMOs are highly recommended before enrolling<lb/> governments in the insurance programmes with direct and contingent fiscal commitments.<lb/></p>
