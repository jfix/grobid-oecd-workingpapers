and the number of people with some form of disability is likely to increase as the population ages. @BULLET Disabilities vary widely in type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset. These characteristics influence individual 
capacities and willingness to become entrepreneurs and to sustain such a status. Self-employment is appropriate for 
many in this population because it can provide more flexibility than paid employment in terms of workload, work schedule 
and work location, which can allow for better management of disability and lifestyle. @BULLET Efforts are needed to increase awareness about the desirability and feasibility of entrepreneurship by people experiencing 
disabilities, both among disabled and non-disabled populations. @BULLET There is some evidence that targeted entrepreneurship training and start-up support programmes can be effective for 
disabled people, but they are expensive to deliver and the size of the target group will not always justify separate provision. @BULLET There is strong potential to adapt existing training and start-up programmes to the needs of the disabled. Business advisors 
should be ready to recommend self-employment as a career option to the disabled, longer support should be available 
if necessary, adapted formats (such as Braille) should be used, and language should be adapted to the realities of the 
clients. Partnerships between business support organisations and specialist disabled support organisations can also help. @BULLET The benefits trap problem should be addressed by ensuring that the welfare system does not cut benefits too quickly on 
transition to entrepreneurship or discriminate unfairly against those disabled people who chose to become entrepreneurs. @BULLET The use of assistive technologies and improvements in IT and Internet accessibility for disabled business users should be 
encouraged. The use of assistive technologies for entrepreneurs (brain–computer interfaces, computer readers for blind 
people, etc.) can be favoured through grants, loans and training in their use. The integration of technological interfaces 
for disabled people in key accounting, taxation and other business management software can be encouraged. Better 
interfaces for disabled people on Internet websites are also needed, starting with improvements in accessibility of online 
government services, such as business registration and tax filing, and promotion of standards for the development of 
private websites that are friendly to disabled people. DISABILITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION Disability impacts a large number of people – approximately 
16 % of the working age population in the EU is afflicted 
with a long-standing health problem or disability (European 
Commission, 2007). And this number will grow as the popu-
lation ages in industrialised countries due to the associated 
increased susceptibility to mental and physical disorders (Lutz 
et al., 2011; Pascarelli et al., 2001). Disabilities are extremely 
diverse and are not a fixed characteristic of individuals. Many 
disabilities are invisible to the eye yet popular stereotypes of 
disabled people as permanent wheelchair users or as blind 
from birth persist. Disability affects a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, 
including labour market participation. People with disabilities 
face many barriers in the labour market and disability is con-
sistently found to have a negative effect on labour market 
outcomes, including employment rates and earnings (Jones, 
2008; Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011; Lechner 
and Vazquez-Alvarez, 2011). Variations in disability (i.e. type, 
severity, quantity) influence labour market participation rates, 
types of occupation and earnings (Jones, 2008, 2011; Berthoud, 
2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011). Locomotor impairments 
exert a substantial negative impact on employment prospects 
(Berthoud, 2008) as does mental health challenges and learning difficulties (Berthoud, 2008; Meager and Higgins, 2011). 
Employer discrimination is a strong influence on the supply of 
jobs for disabled people (Meager and Higgins, 2011), although 
employer perceptions about individuals' capacity to work may 
diverge considerably from their actual capacity to work. The risk of poverty in the EU is significantly higher for disabled 
people than for people without disabilities – 21.1 % of disabled 
people face that risk, compared to 14.9 % of people without 
disabilities (Hauben et al., 2012). The main reason for this dis-
parity can be found in the low employment rates of disabled 
people, which are a cause for and/or a consequence of their 
social exclusion (Greve, 2009; Hauben et al., 2012). The European Union has taken a strong position to support 
the active participation of people with disabilities in society 
and the economy. This is evident in the Europe 2020 Strategy 
(http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm), which aims to 
create smart, sustainable and inclusive growth to build a soci-
ety that includes everyone. In addition, the EU has developed 
a disability strategy (European Commission, 2010), which 
outlines actions to address specific barriers to full participa-
tion in society for people with disabilities (see Box 1 for more 
information). 4 Box 1 European Disability Strategy 2010–20 The EU and its Member States have been given a strong mandate to address the social and economic situation of people 
with disabilities by several charters, treaties and conventions, including: @BULLET The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf), which 
states the need to respect and protect human dignity, ensure the integration of people with disabilities in the community 
(Article 26) and prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability (Article 21); @BULLET The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/ 
TXT), which requires the Union to fight discrimination based on disability when drafting and implementing policies and 
adopting legislation (Articles 10 and 19); and @BULLET The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/con-
ventionfull.shtml), which is a legally binding instrument that protects and safeguards human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of persons with disabilities. Following this mandate, the EU developed this strategy to empower people with disabilities to enjoy full rights and benefits 
from participating in society. The strategy focuses on eliminating barriers for people with disabilities in eight action areas: 
Accessibility, Participation, Equality, Employment, Education and training, Social protection, Health, and External action 
(i.e. actions outside of the EU). To reduce barriers in these areas, a four-pronged strategy has been developed to raise 
awareness; provide financial resources to support and research programmes; improve data collection and monitoring; and 
implement the UN-required governance mechanisms across the Commission and with Member States. Entrepreneurship is indirectly supported by this strategy through the reduction of barriers under the 'Participation' and 
'Employment' themes. For more information, please refer to: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0636:FIN:EN:PDF DEFINING DISABILITY Definitions of disability are shaped by two contrasting concepts: 
the medical model of disability and the social model of dis-
ability. In short, the medical model treats disability as a char-
acteristic of the person and restrictions in activity are explained 
in terms of individuals' bodily capabilities, with impairments 
treated implicitly as a form of negative human capital. In con-
trast, the social model of disability, pioneered by Oliver (1990) 
assumes that people with impairments are disabled by societal 
attitudes, institutions and environmental barriers rather than 
individual characteristics. This model distinguishes 'impair-
ment' (i.e. a limitation of the mind and body) from 'disability' 
(i.e. social exclusion) (Shakespeare, 2006). These distinctions are 
important because they influence the definition of 'disabled' in 
different contexts, especially within the context of eligibility for 
support in public support and active labour market programmes. There is no single definition of disability. The World Health 
Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health (http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en 
and http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/training/icfbeginners-
guide.pdf) defines 'disabilities' as an umbrella term referring to 
impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions: @BULLET An impairment is a problem in body function or structure, 
including physical impairments (e.g. dysfunction of the mus-
culoskeletal, neurological, cardiac, circulatory and respiratory 
body systems); mental illness or disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, 
neuroses and psychotic conditions, anxiety and emotional disorders, phobias, depression); cognitive impairments 
(e.g. brain injuries, dementia); sensory impairments (e.g. sight 
loss or blindness); and intellectual or developmental impair-
ments (e.g. below average general intellectual function). @BULLET An activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an indi-
vidual in executing a task or action. @BULLET A participation restriction is a problem experienced by an 
individual in involvement in life situations. Impairments, limitations and restrictions vary in terms of 
numerous characteristics, i.e. type, severity, stability, duration 
and time of onset. They may be stable, constituting a per-
manent condition, be slowly degenerative or impose episodic, 
fluctuating or recurring restrictions on activities (Boyd, 2012). 
Longitudinal survey panel data from the United Kingdom sug-
gests that the status of being 'disabled' is, for most, a tempo-
rary one (Burchardt, 2000). The long-term disabled constitute 
a relatively small proportion of working age people who experi-
ence disability; 27 % of those who reported a disability in the 
UK indicated that they were impacted by the disability for seven 
consecutive years (the length of the study) (Burchardt, 2000). Individuals may suffer from multiple conditions or impairments. 
The onset of impairments also varies between individuals. 
Some are born with an impairment while others acquire them 
during childhood or adult life as a consequence of accident, ill 5 health or ageing. Impairment might occur suddenly or entail 
a gradual deterioration in health over time. Evidence from the 
UK indicates that only 11 % of the disabled adult population 
is born with their disability, 12 % acquire it in childhood, and 
75 % become disabled during their working life (Burchardt, 
2003). This highlights that no two experiences of disability 
are the same; nor are disabled people equally disadvantaged 
in the labour market. Disability is therefore a complex phenomenon involving inter-
action between a person's body and the society in which they live. Diversity in impairment and disability should discourage 
the use of a simple binary division between 'the disabled' and 
'the non-disabled' for two reasons. First, the two populations 
are fluid rather than fixed. A significant proportion of people 
are affected by disability at some point during their working 
lives. Second, disabled people are a highly differentiated group, 
varying not only in terms of impairment characteristics but 
also in terms of other personal and household characteristics 
(i.e. gender, ethnicity, age, education, family structure) and 
socioeconomic circumstances that influence labour market 
participation rates (e.g. educational attainment). SELF-EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES Data on labour market activities of people with disabilities are 
limited. Available data are quite dated and comparability across 
Member States can be problematic due to the different defini-
tions of disability used in different labour force surveys (Greve, 
2009). Nonetheless, the available data suggest that people 
with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed or inactive 
(Pagán, 2009; Greve, 2009; Applica/CESEP/European Centre, 
2007). Those who are working are often employed in low-
skilled, low-paying occupations (Meager and Higgins, 2011). Data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living 
Conditions (EU-SILC) suggest that across the EU, people with 
disabilities are as likely as those without disabilities to be self-
employed. However, people with disabilities are more likely 
to be inactive in the labour market. Between 22 % (Austria) 
and 78 % (Poland) of the population with identified disabilities 
are not active in the labour market (Applica/CESEP/European 
Centre, 2007). This variation can be explained by several fac-
tors, including the generosity of disability benefits and the 
ease of accessing them, the extent to which people with dis-
abilities are included or excluded from society and education, 
employer discrimination, demographic factors and the incidence 
of severe disabilities. There is large variation in self-employment rates of people 
with disabilities across Member States. The self-employment 
rates of people with disabilities are relatively low in many 
north-eastern EU countries and higher in southern EU countries 
(see Figure 1). For example, the self-employment rates for peo-
ple with disabilities in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia were 
below the 5 % level in 2007, while the rates exceed the 15 % 
level in Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal and Romania. 
Caution is needed in interpreting these data because the differ-
ences in self-employment rates across countries are influenced 
by a number of factors, including variation in the definition of 
disability used in collecting the statistics. However, these data are largely consistent with many studies 
that measure self-employment rates across a small number of 
countries and for specific disabilities (e.g. Blanck et al., 2000; 
Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Meager and Higgins, 2011). For 
example, a study of 13 EU Member States using the European 
Community Household Panel data for the period 1995–2001 
found that self-employment rates among disabled people were 
higher than among people without disabilities (Pagán, 2009). 
This study found that the self-employment rates for people 
with a disability varied across countries and by gender. Men 
with disabilities were 10.5 percentage points (p.p.) more likely 
to be self-employed in Greece than those without disabili-
ties, 8.6 p.p. more likely in Portugal and 8.1 p.p. more likely in 
Ireland. In Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands the rates 
were the same for disabled and non-disabled men. The male 
non-disabled self-employment rate was higher than the male 
disabled self-employment rate (3.0 p.p. higher) only in Belgium. 
For females, those with disabilities were 13.5 p.p. more likely 
to be self-employed in Greece, 10.3 p.p. more likely in Portugal 
and 8.2 p.p. more likely in Austria. There was no difference in 
self-employment rates for women with and without disabilities 
in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland. 6 Figure 1. Self-employment rates by disability status, 2007 People without disabilities

on the type and severity of impairment or disability. For exam-
ple, self-employment rates were higher among people who 
were severely limited in their daily activities than among those 
reporting some or no limitation in daily activities (Pagán, 2009; 
Jones, 2011). There is some evidence from the UK to sug-
gest that men and women with musculoskeletal problems, and 
women with mental health problems, are particularly likely to 
be self-employed, while men with sensory impairments are relatively unlikely to be self-employed (Boylan and Burchardt, 
2002). Data from the UK also suggest that disabled entre-
preneurs are more likely to work alone, rather than employ 
others. Nearly 80 % of the self-employed with disabilities have 
no employees compared to 74 % of those without disabilities 
and non-work-limited disabled men (Jones and Latreille, 2011). 
Moreover, people with disabilities are more likely to operate as 
a home-based business (East Midlands Development Agency – 
EMDA, 2009). THE BENEFITS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES People can be attracted to self-employment for any number of 
reasons. While some enter self-employment out of necessity, 
many seek to take advantage of an opportunity, gain independ-
ence and autonomy, improve their work–life balance, increase 
their satisfaction for work activities and attempt to increase 
their income and other material benefits. While these reasons may also be a significant influence for 
entrepreneurs with disabilities, they are also likely motivated 
by different factors. One of the greatest benefits is that self-employment provides an entry into the labour market 
as employer discrimination is frequently reported (Blanck et 
al., 2000; Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Hagner and Davis, 
2002; EMDA, 2009). Employer discrimination is often high-
est for those impairments or limitations that are subject to 
greater prejudice by employers such as those with mental 
and physical disabilities (Pagán, 2009). For these people, 
self-employment might offer the only opportunity for active 
labour market participation and with it, improved income and 
living standard. 7 Another important advantage of self-employment for those with 
disabilities is that it provides a better adjustment between disabil-
ity status and working life through more flexibility in work pacing, 
hours worked and location of work (Prescott-Clarke, 1990; Callahan 
et al., 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pagán, 2009; Jones and Latreille, 2011; Meager and Higgins, 2011). Thus, self-employment can provide a 
sense of self-empowerment because entrepreneurship can provide 
a person with the opportunity to take control of their disability 
and labour market participation, and be socially and economically 
active to the extent possible for their situation. Inspiring entrepreneurs: Veronica Hedenmark, Sweden Veronica Hedenmark is an entrepreneur from Gothenburg, Sweden. She has founded three companies, VH Assistants, 
VH Action and VH Kids, which all specialise in providing personal assistance for children, youth and adults with disabilities. Veronica was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is a congenital bone disorder characterised by brittle bones. By the 
time that she had turned 9 years old, she had already suffered 152 bone fractures. Despite her condition, Veronica had a 
very social upbringing and enjoyed attending public school. However, upon graduating from high school, Veronica watched 
all of her friends move away to attend university or to work in foreign countries as au pairs. She was left behind, unsure 
of how to take the next step in her life. Veronica was left confused and insulted when the Social Insurance Office offered 
her an early retirement pension, implying that she would never be able to work. Rather than accepting it, she became more 
determined to remain an active participant in society. Her boyfriend helped her understand the difference between having 
a disability and being disabled, and this changed her perspective and outlook on life. The immediate result was a desire to 
start and build a company. In 1996 she founded VH Assistants to help and inspire others that had disabilities. With the success of this company, she 
subsequently founded VH Action and VH Kids to expand the scale and scope of her work. Today the companies have more 
than 600 employees across Sweden. In addition to running successful businesses, Veronica is a successful advocate for people with disabilities and is a sought-
after speaker. In 2008 she was appointed ambassadress of the Swedish Minister for Enterprise and was a finalist for the 
Göranpriset Prize. She won the Compass Rose in 2009, the King's award for young leaders and was named by Business 
World magazine as one of the 100 Most Powerful leaders under the age of 40. Inspiring entrepreneurs: Alan Broadbent, Spain Mr Broadbent lives in Barcelona, Spain and operates a successful business that provides travel-related services for people 
with disabilities. Mr Broadbent was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2000 and has a disability rating of 40 % (Government 
of Catalunya). Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which the covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord 
are damaged, disrupting communication within the nervous system. This can impact an individual's mobility and could also 
result in mental and psychiatric problems. As he and his family adjusted to this condition, Alan founded his company in 
2004 as a result of the challenges that he now faced pursuing his love of travel. The company's primary service is to provide 
wheelchair-and scooter-accessible airport and cruise port transfers in Barcelona, Girona and Reus. His travel company also provides wheelchair excursions for Mediterranean cruise ship passengers. The company partners 
with major cruise lines to offer cruise passengers with mobility challenges the opportunity to enjoy shore excursions in 
modern fully adapted accessible vehicles with English speaking driver/guides. Personal tour guides are also available for 
major tour sites and museums. Alan has also written a book, Barcelona, a Wheelchair Users Guide. In addition to running his businesses, Mr. Broadbent is an active advocate for people with disabilities and is a renowned 
international speaker. He is one of the founders of the Global Network for Entrepreneurs with Disabilities, which acts as a 
support network and information source (http://entrepreneurswithdisabilities.org). 8 THE CHALLENGES FACED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
WHEN STARTING A BUSINESS In addition to facing the general challenges to business start-
up that all entrepreneurs face, entrepreneurs with disabilities 
are likely to face specific barriers to entering and sustaining 
entrepreneurship activities. Some of these barriers, arguably, 
are very deep-rooted social-structural constraints that impose 
severe limits on life chances for certain groups of disabled 
people. These barriers include: @BULLET Lack of confidence and limited aspirations – people with 
disabilities may have difficulty identifying a business oppor-
tunity, developing this business idea and engaging with the 
available support infrastructure in a meaningful way, which 
contributes to low levels of confidence related to business 
start-up (Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009). This is 
further compounded by the unsupportive role of family and 
friends who often discourage start-up. This challenge is 
especially relevant for those with mental health challenges. @BULLET The benefits trap – surveys indicate that there is often a fear 
of losing the security of regular benefit income when other 
income is generated (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, 
2002; EMDA, 2009). Awareness of eligibility for benefits is 
incomplete among the population of people with disabilities 
and contributes to perceptions of self-employment as 'risky'. @BULLET Lack of relevant business knowledge and skills – people with 
disabilities often lack specialist business management, legal 
and financial skills and knowledge due to limited relevant 
education and employment experience (Enabled4Enterprise, 
2008). @BULLET Access to start-up capital – people with disabilities often 
experience difficulties financing new start-ups due to lim-
ited personal financial resources (savings, home ownership), 
which, in turn, are partly due to poor education and the con-
centration of disabled employees in low-paid occupations; 
poor credit rating after long-term benefit receipt; disinterest/ 
discrimination on the part of banks; lack of accessible infor-
mation on sources of grants and loans (Boylan and Burchardt, 
2002; EMDA, 2009). @BULLET Consumer discrimination – self-employment can be deterred 
by customer discrimination, reducing the demand for goods 
and services produced, as well as the rewards to self-employ-
ment (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Jones and Latreille, 
2011). @BULLET Increased labour costs – some entrepreneurs with disabilities 
need to hire assistants to help them undertake tasks that 
many people without disabilities may be able to do on their 
own (e.g. moving merchandise, inputting data into computer 
software), which increases their labour costs and puts them 
at a competitive disadvantage (Roni, 2009). @BULLET Lack of appropriate business support services – this barrier 
has a number of dimensions due to the individual nature 
that disabilities have (Boylan and Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, 
2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009). 
First, business advisers are often reluctant to recommend 
self-employment as a career option for disabled people and 
sometimes actively attempt to dissuade them. Such views 
might be a consequence of advisers' inadequate or stereo-
typical understandings of the activity restrictions arising 
from specific conditions and/or misperceptions of support 
recipients' capabilities as well as a genuine regard for the 
risks disabled people face in starting and running businesses. Second, and crucially, training is not always tailored to indi-
vidual needs and therefore of limited value to particular 
programme recipients. For some, support might need to be 
provided over an extended period of time for recipients with 
recurring conditions or particular stresses. There is a percep-
tion among some support recipients that funders face pres-
sures to move quickly onto the next case rather than provide 
longer-term support to those assisted (a 'tick-box culture'). Third, support services may not be available in particular 
formats (e.g. Braille), which makes the support service inac-
cessible for certain segments of the population of people 
with disabilities. This likely will also impact the awareness 
level of available supports. Fourth, premises where support is provided may not be 
accessible for individuals with conditions and impairments 
that impact their mobility. Moreover, this barrier can be 
increased by challenges related to transport to and from 
support centres for those with mobility challenges. Fifth, support programmes may use language that is off-
putting to people with disabilities. For example, entrepreneurs 
who experience disability often have lower growth aspira-
tions and may not identify with terms such as 'entrepreneur' 
because they do not see themselves as exploiting an oppor-
tunity or being innovative. Sixth, the diversity of impairment and disability means that 
some disabled entrepreneurs might not perceive themselves 
as 'disabled' and prefer to be supported under mainstream, 
rather than disability-specific, services. There is evidence that particular groups of disabled people face 
multiple sources of disadvantage in European labour markets 
(Greve, 2009). Disability is more likely to affect vulnerable 
subgroups within society, for example, the old and the poor 
(World Health Organisation/World Bank, 2011) and people who 
experience disability may face multiple forms of social exclu-
sion and sources of labour market disadvantage (Berthoud, 9 2008). Women, older people and ethnic minority and migrant 
people who experience a disability are likely to face greater 
levels of labour market disadvantage. Disability-related barriers to entrepreneurship might, therefore, be compounded by gen-
der, ethnicity and age barriers as well as deprived socioeco-
nomic contexts. Inspiring entrepreneurs: Yiota Michaelidou, Cyprus Yiota Michaelidou is an entrepreneur in Limassol, Cyprus. She operates a baking and confectionery workshop called 
Paradosiakes Dimiourgies that produces traditional Cypriot-baked goods. Yiota started her career as a kindergarten teacher but attended night classes in bakery and confectionery for pleasure. 
Soon after starting her career, she had an opportunity to put more time into baking while she was at home raising her two 
children. It was around this time that Yiota began showing symptoms of Stargardt's Disease, a form of macular retinopa-
thy, a progressive eye disease that affects central vision. In recent years it has drastically reduced her vision to the point 
where she can only read large print or read with the use of a closed-circuit television. She also uses special magnification 
software to operate her computer. However, this does not impact her mobility greatly, except in unfamiliar environments 
with bright daylight. Despite the onset of Startgardt's Disease, Yiota continued to pursue her love of baking and sought employment at a con-
fectionery shop. She was successful in finding employment opportunities but never stayed long because she felt mistreated 
due to her disability. This gave her the idea of starting her own business. She had a workshop constructed in her parents' house to meet health and safety requirements, as well as her vision needs. 
For example, the stove and mixing bowl have large numbers and are contrasting colours. This new workshop started as a 
trial business, serving two hotels, a kindergarten and a few individuals. At busy periods, Yiota's mother provided assistance, 
along with other women that worked on an hourly basis. Impressed with the start-up operation, a social worker suggested that Yiota attend business and computer training courses 
to help her expand her business. Yiota underwent a needs assessment and participated in small business training for persons 
with disabilities offered by the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance. One of the first steps that she took in launching her 
business was to apply for a grant so that she can invest in two industrial freezers, allowing her to store large quantities of 
frozen products in order to serve more customers. Yiota continues to grow her business and is working on a cookbook with 
traditional delicacies of Cyprus, for persons with vision impairment. FACILITATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY Technology can help people with disabilities maintain an active, 
independent lifestyle and to participate fully in society (Sans-
Bobi et al., 2012). Within this context, these technologies are 
referred to as assistive technologies, which are products that 
increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of peo-
ple with disabilities. These technologies are wide-ranging and 
include, for example, artificial limbs, retina implants and spe-
cialised computer software. The history of assistive technol-
ogy dates back to the early 1890s when the first hearing aid 
was patented (Miltimore, 1892). In 1936, the first artificial 
speech synthesizer was developed by H. W. Dudley for Bell 
Laboratories (Green and Blair, 2011). Bell Laboratories also 
developed the first speech recognition system in 1952. In 1975 
Kurzweil Technology invented the first optical character recog-
nition (OCR) technology, which allows the translation of written 
text into digital language (Green and Blair, 2011). Current research and development related to assistive technol-
ogies concentrates on, for example, gesture-based input devices 
for interaction with information systems (Vatavu et al., 2009; 
Christiansen et al., 2011), cloud-based assistive technologies 
(e.g. screen readers or screen magnifiers) that allow disabled 
people location-independent access to computer systems (Hill, 2011; Caldwell, 2011) and brain–computer interfaces that 
allow the operation of computer systems or the control of 
artificial limbs with one's mind (McCullagh et al., 2010; Wolpaw 
and Wolpaw, 2012; Carmena, 2012). While the first two tech-
nologies already have been successfully commercialised the 
latter is still to be explored extensively. Assistive technologies are evolving at a rapid pace. Although 
they are not directly aimed at supporting entrepreneurship, 
these technologies can help someone in business creation in 
three broad ways. First, improving an individual's ability to par-
ticipate in society increases their self-esteem and confidence, 
increasing the likelihood of starting a business (Seelman, 2008). 
Collecting and managing information is critical for full participa-
tion in today's society and various assistive technologies enable 
people with different kinds of disabilities to have access to 
computer systems. Blind people can use Braille keyboards or 
touch screens to scan digital information. The latter requires the 
application of screen reader software that is capable of reading 
out loud all of the information displayed on the screen. People 
with physical disabilities, who are not able to operate com-
puter systems by mouse and keyboard devices, can use wands 
and sticks to simulate keyboard functionalities or trackballs to 10 simulate mouse functionalities. Sip-and-puff systems allow 
users to communicate with computer systems by using air pres-
sure on a straw, tube or wand (Microsoft Accessibility, 2013). A 
promising technology, especially for physically disabled people, 
is the execution of computer actions and commands by speech 
or eye tracking. This allows a more convenient and efficient 
way to scan and gather information for people with certain 
disabilities. Research is continuously evolving these techniques 
to provide more accurate solutions to end users (Paek et al., 
2007; Beelders and Blignaut, 2010). Second, assistive technologies can help people with disabilities 
interact with customers and develop relationships with sup-
pliers, business partners and financers. Communication can 
occur through different channels and the most disseminated 
channels are e-mail, telephone or voicemail, face-to-face con-
versation, fax and letter (Guffey and Loewy, 2008). Depending 
on one's disability, an individual will prefer one channel to the 
other. For instance, a physically disabled entrepreneur using a 
wheelchair may prefer e-mail or phone calls over face-to-face 
conversations if they require the disabled entrepreneur to visit 
the business partner in an unknown and possibly inaccessible 
area or building. Third, technologies can help entrepreneurs with disabilities to 
manage and control their business processes. In addition to the 
information and communication issues already discussed, the 
achievement of business objectives needs continuous planning 
and monitoring. Much work is still needed in this area because 
many business process management applications or enterprise 
resource planning systems are incompatible with many acces-
sible technologies (Vaziri and De Oliveira, 2012). In addition to assistive technologies, information technolo-
gies (IT) can facilitate entrepreneurship for people with a dis-
ability. IT-accessibility became an important topic in the late 
1990s, when the US government amended section 508 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Thatcher et al., 2006; Kline, 
2011), which now requires all IT purchased by the US govern-
ment to comply with specific accessibility standards. This was 
followed by similar action by other governments (Kline, 2011). For example, the German government passed an equality act 
in 2002, which summons the public sector to provide only 
accessible websites and software applications (German Federal 
Ministry of Justice, 2007). Recent efforts on IT-accessibility focus on the generation and 
acknowledgement of common international standards like Web 
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG, 2008; Kline, 2011), 
which is a major prerequisite for the operation of many assis-
tive technologies. Even though EU policies were able to embody 
laws that compel and standards that support public institutions 
to provide IT-accessibility (United Nations, 2008; The National 
Archives, 1995; German Federal Ministry of Justice, 2007; 
WCAG, 2008; Kline, 2011; W3C, 2006), several studies on web 
accessibility in the EU found that very few public sector web-
sites meet these international standards. For example, a study 
conducted in 2009 tested the conformance level of 102 public 
sector websites and found that none of them met the WCAG 
standard (Cullen et al., 2009). An earlier study conducted by 
the Disability Rights Commission in 2004 investigated 1 000 
private and public websites and found that 81 % of the inves-
tigated websites did not fulfil basic accessibility requirements 
(Disability Rights Commission, 2004). These results have a 
major impact on the individual person, information society 
and business organisational perspective for disabled people. 
They illustrate that current IT-accessibility is insufficient and 
thereby does not support the inclusion of people with disabilities 
in online activities. Given the prominence of the Internet in today's society and 
business environment, improving the accessibility of IT remains 
a priority for the industry and government. Computer software 
and the Internet are also increasingly essential for small busi-
nesses to help entrepreneurs manage tasks such as commu-
nication, inventory management and accounting. Furthermore, 
many interactions between small businesses and governments 
are now online. For example, in many EU countries business 
registration and the filing of taxes can be completed online. 
Governments and business support agencies also provide a 
wealth of business support services and information through 
online portals. POLICY SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES Entrepreneurship can play a role in supporting participation in 
the labour market and society for people with disabilities. While 
entrepreneurship is not for everyone and may not be feasible 
for those with severe or multiple disabilities, it is a feasible 
option for many people with disabilities. The approach taken to support labour market participation for 
people with disabilities in the EU tends to favour increasing 
participation through employment rather than self-employment 
or business creation. A common approach in the EU is to use employment quotas that require public and private organisa-
tions to employ a certain number or proportion of people with 
disabilities; however, a number of countries such as Denmark, 
Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the 
United Kingdom do not use this approach (Greve, 2009). Recognising the range of disabilities and impairments, there 
are several examples of policy actions that support self-
employment and business creation for people with disabilities. 
This includes the incorporation of self-employment in general 11 active labour market programmes (e.g. Ridley et al., 2005) as 
well as schemes that are dedicated to supporting people with 
disabilities in business creation. The priority areas for policy 
development are discussed below. 1. Increase awareness about 
the feasibility of entrepreneurship Goal Relatively high self-employment rates for people with disabili-
ties in the EU suggest that there is an interest in entrepreneur-
ship and self-employment among this population. However, this 
number in real terms is quite small because of the large number 
of inactive people. Many people with disabilities are held back 
to due a lack of awareness, lack of emotional support from 
family and friends, low self-confidence and discouragement 
from business advisors. Promoting the feasibility of entrepre-
neurship for people with disabilities will increase awareness 
of entrepreneurship as a potential labour market activity, not 
only for people with disabilities but also for others who have an 
important role in supporting them. The aim of awareness crea-
tion should be to increase knowledge of self-employment and 
small business ownership as a career option and the potential 
benefits that it can offer. But it is equally important to increase 
awareness of the challenges and risks that need to be consid-
ered so that individuals can decide whether it is appropriate 
activity given their circumstances. Approach Promotion of entrepreneurship activities for people with dis-
abilities should aim to reach three target groups: people with 
disabilities; their role models and support networks such as 
family and friends; and business advisors. One method of 
increasing awareness of entrepreneurship among people with 
disabilities is to raise the profile of entrepreneurship and self-
employment in labour market support programmes. Many 
labour market programmes for people with disabilities focus 
exclusively on job placement, often within the public sector, 
and ignore, or even discourage self-employment (Boylan and 
Burchardt, 2002; Doyel, 2002; Pavey, 2006; Enabled4Enterprise, 2008; EMDA, 2009). It is important to provide enterprise aware-
ness training for advisers whose responsibilities include sup-
porting disabled individuals. This should be disability-specific 
training rather than simply generic diversity training. This type 
of training should seek to educate advisers on the possibilities 
self-employment might afford disabled people as a work option 
and must also cover the challenges and risks. In addition, it 
should seek to overcome adviser reluctance to recommend self-
employment as a viable option. Increasing adviser confidence 
to provide support to disabled entrepreneurs might, indirectly, 
increase the confidence of the target group of entrepreneurs. Policymakers can also promote business creation for peo-
ple with disabilities using role models with disabilities. It is 
important to showcase these inspiring examples for potential 
entrepreneurs with disabilities to demonstrate that business 
creation and self-employment can be achievable. These role 
models should also be included in broader promotional cam-
paigns related to entrepreneurship and self-employment to 
show that self-employment is not an atypical activity for people 
with disabilities. This is important not only to individuals with 
disabilities but also for addressing negative stereotypes and 
attitudes in society. Another approach to increasing awareness is to promote entre-
preneurship through high profile awards for entrepreneurs with 
disabilities. This provides public recognition for success and in 
some cases financial rewards are provided to support further 
business development. Awards are also an effective method 
of attracting media attention to showcase success stories, 
increase awareness of the potential for entrepreneurship 
among people with disabilities and inspire potential entrepre-
neurs. An example of award programme is the Stelios Award 
for Disabled Entrepreneurs (United Kingdom) which are admin-
istered in partnership with Leonard Cheshire Disability charity 
(http://www.stelios.com/entrepreneurship/award-for-disabled-
entrepreneurs-in-the-uk.html). The awards receive considerable 
media attention and provide financial rewards to help entre-
preneurs grow their business. The European Commission is also 
active in this area, operating the European Enterprise Promotion 
Awards (see Box 2) and sponsoring the First European Award 
for Social Entrepreneurship and Disability (http://www.csr-d.eu/ 
social-entrepreneurship-and-disability-award). 12 Box 2 European Enterprise Promotion Awards Target group: The European Commission, DG Enterprise and Industry operates the European Enterprise Promotion Awards, 
which provide awards to entrepreneurs in six categories and a Jury's Grand Prize for the entry that is deemed to be the 
most creative and inspiring entrepreneurship initiative in Europe. One of the six categories is for 'responsible and inclusive 
entrepreneurship', which recognises regional or local actions promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainable 
business practices. This includes support for people with disabilities and the 2012 winner of this category was a project 
called 'Disabled at Work' that was operated by a group of 16 organisations from Turkey and the Netherlands. It provides 
training and mentoring for people with disabilities that seek to enter the workforce, either as an employee or through self-
employment. The 2013 winner in the inclusive entrepreneurship category was 'Integration of Disabled People' in the Slovak 
Republic, which provides driving training for people with disabilities. Intervention type: Awards and recognition programme across the EU. Objectives: The objectives of the European Enterprise Promotion Awards are to identify and recognise successful activities 
and initiatives undertaken to promote enterprise and entrepreneurship; showcase and share examples of best entrepre-
neurship policies and practices; create a greater awareness of the role entrepreneurs play in society; and to encourage and 
inspire potential entrepreneurs. Entry requirements: Entries are made to national juries that each represent a Member State. Eligible entities can be national 
organisations, towns, cities, regions and communities as well as public–private partnerships between public authorities and 
entrepreneurs, educational programmes and business organisations. International initiatives are eligible as long as they are 
nominated jointly by all countries involved. Description: The competition has two stages. Applicants must first compete at the national level, where each country selects 
two entries to be nominated for the EU competition. From these entries, a shortlist of nominees is chosen by the European jury. 
Nominees for 2013 were selected based on the following criteria: (i) originality and feasibility; (ii) the impact that they have 
on the local economy; (iii) the improvement of local stakeholder relations; and (iv) the transferability of the project to other 
regions in Europe. All nominees from the national and European competitions were invited to attend an awards ceremony. To raise awareness about the European Enterprise Awards, the European Commission works in partnership with several 
European umbrella organisations, including the Assembly of European Regions, Committee of the Regions, Eurocities, European 
Association of Economic Development Agencies, Eurochambres and the European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-
Sized Enterprises. Each organisation promotes the awards and nominees through their networks and communication channels. Results achieved: Since the awards started in 2006, nearly 2 400 projects have participated in national competitions for 
a chance to compete in the European Enterprise Promotion Awards. More than 30 projects have won awards and been 
showcased across the EU to inspire others and to spread good practices. Together, nominated projects have created more 
than 10 000 new companies. For further information, please refer to: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/best-practices/european-enterprise-awards 2. Develop entrepreneurship skills Goal Many people with disabilities have difficulty accessing educa-
tion and the labour market and, consequently, many have little 
work experience and very few have experience with entrepre-
neurship. As a result, few people with disabilities have had the 
opportunity to develop the skill-set needed to successfully start 
and run a business. Supporting the acquisition of entrepreneur-
ship skills can help overcome this lack of experience. The goal 
of entrepreneurship training for people with a disability is no 
different than it is for the mainstream population – to increase 
awareness of the potential of entrepreneurship, to deliver the 
skills that will increase the chances of successfully starting 
and operating a business and to develop an entrepreneurial 
mind-set. Approach Policymakers can take two approaches to facilitate the develop-
ment of entrepreneurial skill-sets for people with disabilities. 
One approach is to provide more support to people with dis-
abilities in the education system. People with disabilities are 
only half as likely to complete vocational training or higher 
education as people without disabilities and one of the principal 
barriers is the lack, or inaccessibility, of assistive technolo-
gies which are rehabilitative, adaptive and assistive devices 
that enable disabled people to perform particular tasks (e.g. 
enabling mobility, allowing the use of specific artefacts such 
as furniture and computer keyboards, facilitating communica-
tions) (Hanafin et al., 2007; Nochajski et al., 1999). Improving 
the availability and accessibility of these technologies is a 
first step to increasing educational attainment that will lead 
to increased skill levels and other individual benefits such as 13 higher self-confidence. This can have a positive influence for 
entrepreneurship activities as higher educational attainment 
for people with disabilities leads to better labour market out-
comes, including self-employment (Zwerling et al., 2002; Christ 
and Stodden, 2005). Policymakers can also examine the wide variety of existing 
non-financial supports to ensure that they are accessible for 
people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that the content 
can be accessed in non-standard formats and that programmes 
allow for some flexibility in their delivery. Alternatively, tailored programmes for entrepreneurship 
training can be developed such as 'Ready to Start' in the 
United Kingdom (see Box 3). This approach can overcome 
the challenge of developing training programmes that 
address the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics 
(type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset). This type of intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small group sup-
port provision, has demonstrated the most successful out-
comes (Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise, 2009a, 
b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013). Tailored approaches 
need to assess individuals' business potential, ensure the 
feasibility of the business idea, address skill and knowledge 
deficiencies with business education, training and technical 
support, support the development of a realistic business plan 
and support adjustments as the business is realised (Arnold 
and Ipsen, 2005). While effective, such tailored approaches 
are highly resource intensive and can therefore be difficult 
to launch. An effective approach to overcome this challenge 
is for policymakers to work with specialised organisations 
who are already active in supporting people with disabilities. 
In addition to leveraging external knowledge and support, 
this will improve outreach to the target clients and allows 
policymakers to benefit from the credibility and experience 
of existing organisations. Box 3 Ready to Start, United Kingdom Target group: Ready to Start supported people with any form of disability. Intervention type: It supported business start-up with skills training and individual business advisory services, matched 
with direct financial support. Description: The project operated between 2006 and 2009 and aimed to support 600 participants start businesses. A team 
of regional coordinators recruited clients and developed relationships with partner organisations to gain their support and to 
seek client referrals. Partner organisations provided mentoring and training, as well as one-to-one advice on non-business 
matters including benefits, housing and self-management. Regional coordinators oversaw the support delivery to ensure that 
clients received the full range of support services needed and organised face-to-face and virtual networking events. After 
the project started, direct financial support was added in the form of a small development fund. It aimed to help participants 
purchase equipment, insurance and marketing materials, computer refurbishment and assistive technologies and membership 
of the Federation of Small Businesses or similar trade bodies to provide continuing support and networking opportunities. The project was organised and operated by the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity and much of the financial support was 
provide by Barclays Bank. Additional funding and support was provided by the Prince's Trust and other partner organisa-
tions such as Action for Blind People and Business Link London were crucial in recruiting and referring clients. These two 
organisations were responsible for recruiting 43 % of the clients. Other partner organisations were important partners for 
delivering training and advisory services, including Destiny, Northern Pintetree Trust and Meganexus. Results achieved: The project recruited 1 382 potential entrepreneurs with disabilities and of these, 735 established new 
businesses. Participant surveys indicate that 82 % of clients found the support to be useful, 75 % said they were satisfied with 
programme management and delivery and 93 % stated they wanted it to continue. Participants reported that the develop-
ment fund was the most useful element of the support, followed by the mentoring offer. Project evaluations estimate that 
the project saved the UK Treasury GBP 3.5 million (approximately EUR 4.3 million) in benefit payments. Lessons for other initiatives: The project was successful because it provided intensive support that was tailored to 
individual needs. However, this required a large amount of financial and human resources. The charity was able to lever-
age a combination of public and private sector funds and strategically partner with complementary organisations to recruit 
participants and deliver the services. The project serves as a good example of how complementary, non-competitive rela-
tionships across a network of partners can successfully reach clients and deliver a service to a very narrow target base 
across a wide geographic area. For more information, please refer to: http://www.leonardcheshire.org/what-we-do/past-projects#.U6fzmRBLoyY 14 3. Support the development, 
acquisition and use of assistive 
technologies Goal Assistive technology can be life changing for people with dis-
abilities. They are becoming more sophisticated, increasingly 
portable, less expensive and easier to use, and as result, hold 
greater potential for improving the inclusion of people with 
disabilities in economic activities and in entrepreneurship 
(Angelocci et al., 2008). Policymakers can play a significant role 
in supporting the development of these technologies to ensure 
continual improvement and support people with disabilities in 
acquiring and using these technologies. Approach Existing European policy currently supports the development 
of assistive technologies for a wide range of applications such as, ambient living, accessible transport and accessible 
computer-interaction. To further support technological devel-
opment in these areas, governments can take two actions. 
First they can continue to support research in these areas 
through research grants and R & D incentives. In particu-
lar, more incentives could be provided to develop assistive 
technologies that relate to business software and business 
organisational tools. Second, actions can be taken to improve standardisation 
in the assistive technology market. Common standards 
are needed to reduce complexity and incompatibility of 
accessible technologies. The implementation of obligatory 
standards has had a positive impact in the United States 
(Stack et al., 2009) and as noted earlier, there is much 
room for improvement in this regard in the EU. To address 
this, the European Commission is supporting a number of 
projects such as Cloud4all (see Box 4), which promotes the 
development of assistive technologies related to informa-
tion technologies. Box 4 Cloud4all Intervention type: Cloud4all is a project that aims to advance the development of assistive technologies to allow people 
with disabilities to better use information technologies such as computers and the Internet. Objectives: People with disabilities often require assistive technologies to interact with computers and other information 
technologies. One of the challenges faced by people with disabilities is that each time they use a new piece of equipment or 
technology, the assistive technology must be downloaded, installed and configured prior to use. This can be a major barrier 
for disabled people, for example when interacting with a public computer. Cloud4all provides solutions to store assistive 
technologies and user profiles in a cloud for location-independent access (Cloud4all, 2013a). Description: Cloud4all is an international project funded by the seventh framework programme (FP7) of the European Union 
that advances the concept of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) by improving the ability for assistive technolo-
gies to work across platforms, technologies and applications (Cloud4all, 2013). The GPII is a project of 'Raising the Floor', a 
consortium of academic, industry and non-governmental organisations and individuals. The initiative applies a consortium as 
legal form, composed of 27 members representing various types of public and private organisations from different European 
countries. The project coordinator is Fundosa Technosite S.A. in Spain and it has the following objectives (Cloud4all, 2013): @BULLET Simple, instant accessibility for all; @BULLET Access anywhere, from any device; @BULLET Better connect supply and demand; and @BULLET Provide an affordable method that offers the diversity of needs. Total costs of the project amount to approximately EUR 13.1 million, of which EUR 7.6 million are received from the European 
Commission (European Commission, 2012). Results expected: Cloud4all will allow the development of usable and accessible interfaces for people that face challenges 
using information technology products due to disability, literacy or age-related barriers. The development of Cloud4all will 
also have significant impacts for suppliers of assistive technologies and accessible information and communication tech-
nologies by providing an accessible platform for their products and services (Cloud4all, 2013a). 15 In addition to supporting the development of these technolo-
gies, policymakers can also support the acquisition and use 
of assistive technologies by entrepreneurs with disabilities. 
This is often done by providing direct financial support, such 
as a grant, that assists in the acquisition of special equip-
ment and technologies needed when starting a business. One 
example of this approach can be found in Greece where the 
European Social Fund supports a self-employment scheme 
for the vulnerable unemployed, which provides grants to cover 
business start-up costs for unemployed people from vulner-
able groups. Unemployed people with disabilities are also 
eligible to receive additional grants to cover up to 90 % of 
the cost of adapting their workplace to their disability. For 
more information on this scheme, please refer to OECD/The 
European Commission (2013). This approach is also used in Austria. Labour market policy 
related to disability in Austria focuses on vocational training and job placement initiative. As part of these employment ini-
tiatives, the grants are provided by the Federal Social Welfare 
Office to support people with disabilities in obtaining employ-
ment or entering self-employment (as well as offering incen-
tives to businesses to hire people with disabilities). The support 
for self-employment includes an ongoing subsidy to address 
disability-related performance constraints. This subsidy covers 
the purchase of machinery, equipment or technologies that 
address workplace (i.e. mobility-related), technical and ergo-
nomic challenges. It covers a minimum of half of the costs and 
can be accessed on an ongoing basis. Policy can also support training so that people with disabilities 
know how to properly use assistive technologies and informa-
tion and communication technologies so that they can maxim-
ise participation in society and the labour market. One approach 
is computer training offered by the Latvian Society for the 
Blind (see Box 5). Box 5 Latvian Society for the Blind Target group: The Latvian Society for the Blind provides training and rehabilitation support for those who are fully or 
partially visually impaired. Intervention type: This organisation provides vocational and computer training. Objectives: The goals of the society are (i) to cooperate with the Latvian parliament, government, local institutions and 
non-governmental organisations to promote issues and concerns for visually impaired people; (ii) to raise awareness among 
the general public about the causes and consequences of blindness, promoting methods of overcoming challenges to 
achieve success in education, professional career, social and private life; (iii) to provide occupational training, rehabilitation 
and integration into the labour market; and (iv) to provide assistance in obtaining assistive devices such as white canes, 
magnifiers, talking watches, and other technologies. Description: The Latvian Society for the Blind Rehabilitation Centre was established in 1993 and works in co-operation 
with the Latvian state employment office to provide rehabilitation services for people with visual impairments. The services 
include mobility training, Braille reading and writing, housekeeping, cooking and more. These are provided in two programmes 
of either 50 or 400 hours, depending on the needs of the individual. This support includes occupational training to help 
participants learn skills that can be used in employment to help them start their own business. There are currently two types 
of training provided, wickerwork and massage. Starting in 1998, the Rehabilitation Centre started providing computer train-
ing. There are 10 places per course, of which four are reserved for people that are fully blind. The course helps participants 
learn how to use synthesised speech tools, screen magnifiers and other technologies that allow them to use computers. Results achieved: To date, 61 visually impaired people have received training in wickerwork and 75 % work as self-employed 
craftspeople. An additional 61 people were trained in massage and nearly all continue to work in this field. For more information, please refer to: http://www.lnbrc.lv 16 4. Ensure access to appropriate 
financial support Goal Access to finance for business start-up is often cited as one 
of the greatest barriers to business start-up and this chal-
lenge can be even greater for entrepreneurs with disabilities. 
Many potential entrepreneurs with disabilities have little work 
experience and as a result often have low levels of savings 
and collateral. It can also be more difficult for them to obtain 
external financing because they can have difficulty accessing 
information on financing and sources of investment. At the 
same time, they may have a greater need for external financing 
because they may have higher costs during business start-up 
due to a need to purchase technology or equipment related to 
their disability or a need to hire additional help to do tasks that 
many entrepreneurs can do themselves. Public policy should 
aim to ensure that entrepreneurs with disabilities can access 
financing for business creation. In most instances there will not 
be a sufficient base of potential entrepreneurs with disabilities 
to warrant the creation of a specialised micro-finance scheme 
for entrepreneurs with disabilities. Instead, policymakers should 
aim to open up access to mainstream financing schemes to 
entrepreneurs with disabilities. In addition, policymakers should 
also ensure that funding is available to help people with dis-
abilities acquire and learn to use specialised equipment that 
will facilitate business creation and management. Approach A good place for policymakers to start when looking to improve 
access to finance for potential entrepreneurs with disabilities 
is to ensure that existing financial supports are accessible and 
available to people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that 
information on sources of financing is available in accessible 
formats and the financing programmes do not discriminate 
based on disability. Second, policymakers can help bridge the gap between potential 
entrepreneurs and investors by helping disabled entrepreneurs become investment-ready and by facilitating access to inves-
tors with networking events, 'pitching events' and business 
competitions. The aim is to help entrepreneurs understand 
how the financial industry operates and the requirements 
for receiving investment. Policymakers can go even further 
by bringing investors and entrepreneurs together in special 
events. Face-to-face contact is important to build networks 
and relationships, and entrepreneurs can use the opportunity 
to 'sell' their entrepreneurial project. An example of such an 
approach is 'Enabled4Growth' which was a small project in 
London, United Kingdom, that aimed to support disabled entre-
preneurs in accessing finance to expand their business. While it 
did not directly provide funding for the participants, it provided 
training entrepreneurs on how to be investment-ready, to help 
with funding applications and to host networking events where 
entrepreneurs could meet investors. A third approach is to increase the availability of direct financ-
ing, either as small grants or repayable loans. There are a very 
small number of policy schemes in the EU that provide targeted 
financial support for entrepreneurs with disabilities but a lesson 
to bear in mind when designing targeted financial support is 
that financial support for business start-up is more effective 
when delivered in parallel with skills training. An example of 
this approach is 'Looking for another sense for entrepreneur-
ship' in the Slovak Republic, which provides training and funding 
through a business plan competition. See Box 6 for more details. Financial support might also extend to the issue of benefits. In 
particular, policymakers should ensure that those moving from 
labour market inactivity, and a high reliance on various forms of 
disability-related benefit, are not disadvantaged or discouraged 
by a benefit system that either responds too quickly to cut ben-
efits before the transition to entrepreneurship has generated 
any economic gain or by one that adapts too slowly where the 
attempt at entrepreneurship proves unsuccessful. The benefit 
system should be flexible enough to encourage individuals to 
create new firms but also to support those unable to make 
them work. This flexibility should be communicated effectively 
to those at whom the system is targeted, so unjustified fears 
are mitigated, reducing a key barrier to business start-up. 17 Box 6 Looking for another sense ('Hľadáme ďalší zmysel – PRE PODNIKANIE'), Slovak Republic Target group: 'Looking for another sense' is a project for deaf entrepreneurs aged 18 to 55. Intervention type: The project provides information, business consultancy and direct financial support. Objectives: The project aims to help provide training and labour market support for deaf people in the Slovak Republic 
because education opportunities and labour market support is limited to a small number of schools that offer specific train-
ing for a limited number of careers such as hairdressing, tailoring, carpentry or goldsmithing. Many skilled deaf people are 
long-term unemployed and have difficulty accessing labour market information and appropriate training. Description: The project is organised and implemented by the Endowment Fund Telekom at the Pontis Foundation, which 
is largely funded by private donors but it also receives some government support. It offers self-employment training and 
access to established entrepreneurs through an online forum, as well as other services such as sign language translators 
and training. In 2012, EUR 50 000 was allocated to support deaf entrepreneurs on the programme. Every year, 20 deaf people who are interested in self-employment are selected by an independent committee for a free 
week-long course on business start-up. The course consists of 45 teaching hours that include short lectures, discussions and 
case studies of successful entrepreneurs. During this training, participants learn about basic business finance, marketing and 
regulation. The course is offered for free; participants only pay for travel expenses incurred to reach the training session. Following the course, participants are eligible to receive additional mentoring support at no cost. This includes support in the 
development of a business plan and business advisory services during the first 12 months of business operation. Participants 
are eligible to receive a grant of up to EUR 3 320 to support their business start-up by applying to an independent committee 
and successfully defending their business plan. The project also provides networking opportunities for participants to meet 
and develop partnerships with other entrepreneurs. Finally, the project also offers free advertising space on an online portal. Results achieved: Since the project started in 2008, more than 48 deaf entrepreneurs have successfully started their own 
businesses, creating jobs for an 50 additional people with hearing impairments. Approximately half of these businesses 
continue to operate. One of the most successful supported start-ups is Deaf Kebab, a kebab restaurant where customers 
order using sign language. Deaf Kebab currently has four franchises and employees more than 10 employees with hearing 
impairments. Other supported businesses operate in a wide variety of sectors, including parachute repairs. The online web 
portal has also expanded to become a broader online business support resource for deaf entrepreneurs and now includes 
pertinent business information and a business advisory forum. Lessons for other initiatives: The success of the project is due to an integrated support package that provides entrepre-
neurship training before start-up and builds on this initial skill-set after business start-up through targeted business advisory 
services and networking support. In addition, a competitive mechanism is used to award financial support which acts as an 
incentive for participants and awards funding where it is most likely to be used successfully. Another feature that comple-
ments the support for the entrepreneur is the support that the online portal provides in reaching the market. This support 
is intensive and costly. One of the ongoing challenges that the project faces is the need to find financial donors to ensure 
that the support is provided free-of-charge to clients. For more information, please refer to: http://www.nepocujucipodnikatelia.sk/grantovy-program/o-programe 18 5. Continue to improve Internet 
and IT accessibility Goal The Internet and mobile communication technologies have 
become an integral part of society as they are now primary 
methods of communication and accessing information. However 
the benefits are not shared by all because many people with 
disabilities have difficulty using many of these new technolo-
gies because they are often developed on different platforms 
that are incompatible with assistive technologies. Policymakers 
can do more to support the development and implementation 
of accessibility standards that would improve access to these 
technologies for people with disabilities. Approach The EU has made a commitment towards improving Internet 
and IT accessibility by signing the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2008). In addi-
tion, many EU countries passed laws and policies regarding 
the accessibility of websites and software applications for the 
public and private sector (W3C, 2006). However, evidence sug-
gests that there is still a long way to go towards achieving the 
stated objectives in this regard. The first area of action for policymakers is to improve the 
IT-accessibility of public websites. The European Union supports 
Member States in these improving the accessibility of their web-
sites with projects such as the Digital Agenda for Europe, which 
aims to achieve full accessibility of public sector websites by 
2015 (European Commission, 2013). This is critical for people 
with disabilities who are considering self-employment because 
many public services are now online. For example, information on 
business start-up and self-employment is disseminated through 
websites along with links to other supports. Moreover, improving 
the accessibility of public websites will help people with dis-
abilities comply with obligations such as business registration 
and filing taxes. Improving the accessibility of public websites is 
also a necessary step for governments to take before considering 
measures to improve accessibility for the private sector. Another important area for action is to harmonise the standards 
and obligations in IT-accessibility across the EU. The Internet 
holds great potential for entrepreneurs with disabilities because 
it can help them overcome challenges related to communica-
tion and mobility. However, the vast majority of websites are 
not in accessible formats and are not compatible with assistive 
technologies. To make a significant impact in this area, large 
international efforts are required. There are a small number of 
projects such as Veritas (see Box 7) that attempt to bring public 
and private stakeholders together to address these issues. Box 7 Virtual and augmented environments and realistic user interactions to achieve embedded 
accessibility designs (Veritas), Germany One of the significant challenges in the development of accessible technologies is the uncertainty of needs and requirements 
by the end-users. In many cases major modifications occur after the product is developed, which adds a significant cost to 
the process. The goal of Veritas project, which ran between 2010 to 2013, was to reduce the need for major modifications 
after product development by identifying and comprehending user requirements more accurately and increasing the use of 
standard technology platforms (Veritas, 2013). The initiative was a consortium, composed of 31 organisations from across the EU. The project is coordinated by Fraunhofer 
Corporation in Germany. The total costs of this project were approximately EUR 11.7 million and it received EUR 8.0 million 
from the European Commission's Community Research and Development Information Service (European Commission, 2013b). Veritas bridged the gap between clients and technology producers by increasing access to information on the development 
of information and communication technologies (ICT) and non-ICT products, concerning application areas such as: home, 
workplace and entertainment. In addition, it aimed to better understand the requirements of these applications needed by 
people with disabilities and ensure that developers and producers have this information (Dangelmaier, 2010). For example, 
the project developed several pilot applications that allow designers to better address the needs of various disabilities in 
their products, including applications for automotive and motorcycle design, virtual simulators for home and office spaces 
and simulators for healthcare products. In addition, Veritas advanced work in the entertainment field by developing multi-
modal interfacing tools that enable the conversion of the game content into information that is easily perceivable by users 
with disabilities. Moreover, virtual reality technology was developed for games with therapeutic value for older people (i.e. 
exercising cognitive and motor abilities) (Dangelmaier, 2010). The project also aimed to provide a common platform for these technologies so that fewer modifications are needed once 
the technologies are developed. This can also significantly enhance the dissemination of assistive technologies and new 
services across the EU. People with disabilities will benefit from larger supplies of assistive technologies and innovative 
services regarding their self-employment activities (Dangelmaier, 2010). For more information, please refer to: http://veritas-project.eu/about-2 19 CONCLUSIONS Approximately 16 % of the working age population in the EU is 
impacted by disability and this proportion is likely to increase as 
the population ages. Therefore, the issue of social and economic 
participation of people with disabilities will become increasingly 
important policy issue over the next decade and entrepreneurship 
can be part of the solution for some members of this population. 
People with disabilities are disproportionately inactive in the 
labour market in all Member States (Applica/CESEP/European 
Centre, 2007), but there is evidence to suggest that people 
with disabilities that participate in the labour market are just 
as likely as those without disabilities to be self-employed. Self-
employment can facilitate active social and economic participa-
tion and give control to the individual over their participation. 
Entrepreneurship can allow flexibility in workload, work hours and 
work location, providing more flexibility in coping with disability 
than can be often found in paid employment. While business creation and self-employment are not suitable 
for all people with disabilities, there are several ways in which 
policymakers can improve their support for entrepreneurship 
for people with disabilities. A first approach is to review current 
business start-up support offerings to ensure that it is available 
in accessible formats and to educate business advisors on the 
potential and risks that business start-up and self-employment 
have for people with disabilities. It is a realistic career option 
for many and they should not be discouraged based on dis-
ability alone. An important element of improving information 
on business start-up for people with disabilities is to increase 
the amount of information available on the impact of business 
creation and self-employment income on benefit payments 
received by individuals. Many people with disabilities receive 
different forms of public support including disability insurance 
payments, housing allowances, minimum income supports, 
etc. and it is important for their decision to start a business. A second area of action for governments is to support the devel-
opment and adoption of assistive technologies. Development of these technologies is vitally important for much of this popu-
lation to more fully participate in daily life. Policymakers can 
support these development efforts directly with funding and 
tax incentives and offer financial incentives and support for 
individuals to encourage the adoption of these technologies. 
International cooperation is important in this field and gov-
ernments should seek partnerships with other governments, 
international organisations and the business sector to ensure 
common standards and platforms. Third, there is a limited evidence base that supports the 
development of targeted training and support that is tai-
lored to the needs and challenges of entrepreneurs and 
potential entrepreneurs with various disabilities. There are 
three important considerations for this policy approach. First, 
the size of the potential client group is nearly always very 
small given the heterogeneity of impairment characteristics 
(e.g. type, severity, stability, duration and time of onset). 
Consequently, policy may need to support entrepreneurs with 
diverse impairment characteristics in different ways and over 
varying timescales. Intensive, tailored, one-to-one, or small 
group support provision, likely produces the most success-
ful outcomes (Arnold and Ipsen, 2005; Enabled4Enterprise, 
2009a, b; EMDA, 2009; Dotson et al., 2013) but such tailored 
approaches are highly resource intensive. Partnerships with 
specialist organisations are often essential to the success 
of targeted approaches because they already have credible 
relationships with the target clients and policymakers can 
leverage existing resources to make tailored approaches 
more cost-effective. Finally, governments should be doing more to ensure that all 
public websites are accessible. With the Internet becoming 
the primary way in which governments and citizens interact, 
much more can be done to improve the accessibility of online 
business services such as business registration, tax filing and 
business information resources. 20 FURTHER READING Kitching, J. (2013), 'Entrepreneurship and disability', OECD Local Economic and Employment Development Programme, Paris.

It presents data on the scale of self-employment and entrepreneurship activities undertaken by people with disabilities and 
discusses the barriers to entrepreneurship that are unique to people with disabilities. The policy brief also discusses policy 
approaches to support entrepreneurship for people with disabilities, including increasing awareness about the feasibility 
of entrepreneurship; developing entrepreneurship skills; supporting the development, acquisition and use of assistive tech-
nologies; ensuring access to appropriate financial support; and, improving Internet and IT accessibility. The brief provides 
examples of successful policy approaches used in the EU as well as inspiring stories about entrepreneurs with disabilities. This policy brief is part of a series of documents produced by the OECD and the European Commission on inclusive entre-
preneurship. The series includes policy briefs on youth entrepreneurship, senior entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, 
evaluation of inclusive entrepreneurship programmes, access to business start-up finance for inclusive entrepreneurship and 
entrepreneurship by the disabled as a well as a report on`Theon`The Missing Entrepreneurs'. All these documents are available in
