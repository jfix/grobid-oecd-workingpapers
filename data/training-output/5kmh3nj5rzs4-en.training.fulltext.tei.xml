			<head>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<lb/></head>

			<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in<lb/> November 1974. Its mandate is two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member<lb/> countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply and to advise member<lb/> countries on sound energy policy.<lb/> The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among 28 advanced<lb/> economies, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports.<lb/> The Agency aims to:<lb/> n Secure member countries&apos; access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular,<lb/> through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions.<lb/> n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection<lb/> in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute<lb/> to climate change.<lb/> n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of<lb/> energy data.<lb/> n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies<lb/> and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy<lb/> efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies.<lb/> n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement<lb/> and dialogue with non-member countries, industry,<lb/> international organisations and other stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<head>Executive summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Brazil, China, India and South Africa have each worked to improve access to electricity services.<lb/> While many of the challenges faced by these countries are similar, the means of addressing them<lb/> varied in their application and effectiveness. On the basis of our analysis of these four country<lb/> profiles, we have determined the prerequisites to successful rural electrification policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>1: Preconditions to successful rural electrification policies<lb/></head>

			<p> Sound statistical data on populations&apos; geographical distribution and a clear description<lb/> of the electrification situation are essential if governments are to avoid the risk of<lb/> overlooking remote population groups and to facilitate the choice of end-use.<lb/>  Sustained government support and long-term funding will guarantee a more effective<lb/> implementation of electrification objectives, and the elimination of any misuse of<lb/> electrification funds in favour of other objectives.<lb/>  Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political agendas ensure that<lb/> funds are &quot; ring-fenced &quot; , efforts are durable and electrification objectives are not<lb/> interfered with according to politicians&apos; personal agendas.<lb/>  The establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private investors ensures<lb/> the wider use of stand-alone systems in remote areas.<lb/>  Related policies and/or regulations including energy efficiency policies should be<lb/> implemented alongside the electrification process to sustain long-term economic<lb/> development.<lb/>  Connection costs should be eliminated or spread over time so as to minimise any<lb/> upfront hindrances to being connected, and electricity tariffs should be affordable but<lb/> not necessarily subsidised.<lb/>  Effective metering, billing and payment recovery ensure the long-term viability of the<lb/> electricity supplier and therefore of the electrification process as a whole.<lb/>  Full involvement of the rural communities in the electrification efforts throughout the<lb/> decision-making process increases their sense of ownership and brings support to<lb/> utilities&apos; efforts to encourage customers to use electricity wisely once they are<lb/> connected.<lb/></p>

			<head>2: Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural<lb/> electrification efforts<lb/></head>

			<p> Locally-produced and resource-specific technologies for electrification will reduce the<lb/> need to import systems and facilitate their use in any given region.<lb/>  Good management and maintenance of the systems require adequate training,<lb/> assistance services and customer supply chains for their long-term use.<lb/>  Sufficient long-term funding ensures long-term system maintenance.<lb/>  Banning the idea that stand-alone systems provide &quot; second-class &quot; electricity gives<lb/> communities a sense of ownership of the system.<lb/></p>

			<head>3: Grid extension: conditions for successful rural<lb/> electrification efforts<lb/></head>

			<p> Reduction of transmission and distribution losses keeps costs of electrification under<lb/> control.<lb/>  Reduction of losses due to electricity theft ensures suppliers&apos; longer-term viability.<lb/>  The use of low-cost technologies keeps costs of electrification under control.<lb/></p>

			<head>4: Three rural electrification boosters<lb/></head>

			<p> Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the first stages of<lb/> electrification. Indeed, economic development will follow sooner or later even when<lb/> productive end-uses are not the prime objective to electrification.<lb/>  Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchanges with other countries<lb/> accelerate the electrification process.<lb/>  Co-operation in the framework of IEA Implementing Agreements for exchanges on<lb/> technologies and support in policy formulation will spur the electrification process and<lb/> facilitate long-term collaboration with other countries on other policy and technology<lb/> issues of interest.<lb/></p>

			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<table>Since the G8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005, the International Energy Agency&apos;s (IEA) Networks of Expertise<lb/> in Energy Technology (NEET) Initiative 1 has sought to encourage further involvement of major emerging<lb/> economies in the IEA Technology Network comprising international energy technology and R&amp;D<lb/> collaborative programmes. Missions and workshops when feasible have been organised in the so-called<lb/> &quot; Plus-Five &quot; countries, namely Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. These outreach efforts have<lb/> been geared towards identifying areas of mutually desirable and potential future collaboration between<lb/> experts of these major emerging economies and the IEA Technology Network including the Committee<lb/> on Energy Research and Technology (CERT), Working Parties (WP) and Implementing Agreements (IA). 2<lb/></table>

			<p>Rural electrification has been singled out as a potential field for international collaborative activities within<lb/> the IEA framework. Policy makers, industries and R&amp;D institutions in the targeted economies have all<lb/> expressed interest in discussing with one another and with international experts, in exchanging their<lb/> experiences, lessons learned and continuing challenges in their efforts to bring energy services to the rural<lb/> world. In response to this interest, the IEA has begun exploring its role as facilitator of international<lb/> exchanges on energy technologies and policies for rural electrification in developing economies.<lb/> In May 2008, the IEA hosted a workshop on &quot; Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging<lb/> Economies &quot; , in collaboration with the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and with<lb/> the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Renewable Energy<lb/> Policy Network for the 21 st Century (REN21). The goal of this workshop was to explore opportunities<lb/> for extending IEA&apos;s collaborative activities to better respond to the major emerging economies&apos;<lb/> interest in international collaboration on rural energisation. 3 Delegates from eleven emerging<lb/> economies, namely Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco,<lb/> Pakistan and South Africa, met representatives from nine IEA Implementing Agreement (IA)<lb/> programmes and from interested government and international bodies. This was an opportunity for<lb/> IAs to display their collaborative activities and discuss with the country representatives on how to<lb/> join forces in carrying forward existing efforts. Specific goals were also to establish to what degree<lb/> the emerging economies are committed to such collaboration and to identify the preferred vehicle.<lb/> The key messages emerging from the workshop highlighted the importance of a constructive<lb/> dialogue and a &quot; made-to-measure &quot; , non-prescriptive approach. Participants also noted the need to<lb/> have the IEA as a focal point for information exchanges not only between the IEA countries and<lb/> emerging economies, but also among the latter. They noted that rural energy decision makers<lb/> required support in adapting policies to local conditions and that assistance was needed in<lb/> technology transfer and capacity building, both technical and policy-related. They encouraged<lb/> further work on policy benchmarking and invited the IEA to undertake a comparative analysis of the<lb/> effectiveness and efficiency of national and regional policies to accelerate rural energisation.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper directly stems from the conclusions of this workshop. It describes the rural electrification<lb/> policies adopted by the four major emerging economies, with a view to analysing the keys to the<lb/> successful implementation of such policies. 4<lb/></p>

			<head>Rural electrification: main challenges and issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Roughly 22% of the world&apos;s population still does not have access to electricity. In 2008, this<lb/> represented 1.5 billion people, most of whom lived in remote areas often difficult to access and<lb/> therefore to connect to national or regional grids. The International Energy Agency estimates that<lb/> roughly 85% of the people without electricity live in rural areas in developing countries, mostly in<lb/> peri-urban or remote rural areas (IEA, 2009b). Today, most of these people are found in sub-<lb/>Saharan Africa and South Asia. The IEA predicts that in 2030, if no new policy to alleviate energy<lb/> poverty is introduced, 1.3 billion people (some 16% of the total world population) will still be denied<lb/> electricity most of whom in South Asia and Africa (IEA, 2009b).<lb/> Not all electrification policies target poor rural households. Some also target a mix of farms, big<lb/> villages and small towns all of which call for different technologies. In fact, rural electrification<lb/> policies are shaped according to the various energy needs, resources and target groups. Electrifying<lb/> the suburb of a major Indian city obviously poses problems that are different from those of a<lb/> remote village in China. As problems are far greater in rural areas than in urban settings (<ref type="biblio">Barnes,<lb/> 2007</ref>) we will focus our attention on electrification policies in favour of the world&apos;s rural poor.<lb/></p>

			<head>General challenges faced by rural communities<lb/></head>

			<p>Rural electrification is defined here as the process by which access to electricity is provided to households<lb/> or villages located in the isolated or remote areas of a country. Remote or rural regions lacking electricity<lb/> supply are often characterised by well identified challenges. They may lie at a reasonable distance from<lb/> national or regional electricity grids (remote villages in the Amazon), may be difficult to access (far from<lb/> urban centres with a difficult terrain such as large rivers or jungles), or may suffer harsh climatic conditions<lb/> that render electrification through grid extension a perilous task. Rural communities are also often highly<lb/> dispersed with a low population density and characterised by a low level of education, low load density<lb/> generally concentrated at evening peak hours, and low revenues. Adding to these challenges, the rural<lb/> poor without access to electricity either spend relatively large amounts of their scarce financial resources<lb/> on energy, or a disproportionate amount of time collecting firewood.<lb/></p>

			<p>In light of these challenges, electricity provision to the world&apos;s rural poor calls for a committed and<lb/> long-term action plan. The benefits that electricity access brings to households and communities<lb/> are justified not only on social and economic grounds but also on grounds of equity objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social benefits of electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>At the household level, electricity is mainly used for powering light bulbs, fans, television sets,<lb/> computers and phones (when available). For over 30 years the World Bank and other organisations<lb/> have studied the social benefits of electricity access and have noted that these benefits usually<lb/> derive from the longer days that powered light bulbs offer to the household. In addition, access to<lb/> information, communication and health care is facilitated by the powering of computers and<lb/> Page | 13<lb/> phones. When electricity is used for powering home appliances, household chores tend to become<lb/> less tedious; when it is used for lighting, the relative brightness of the light bulb as opposed to<lb/> candle light allows children to read or study in the later hours of the day, bringing obvious<lb/> education and leisure benefits (<ref type="biblio">Barnes, 2007</ref>). Women and children benefit directly from these<lb/> improvements, but table or ceiling fans and television sets offer comfort during evening leisure<lb/> time, increasing the general welfare of all members of the household.<lb/></p>

			<head>Economic benefits of electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>Besides the social benefits, decision makers tend to give more importance to the economic impact<lb/> of access to electricity as an income-generating process. Electricity use is expected to lead to more<lb/> productive processes; the growth of businesses or farms using electricity will then increase demand<lb/> for electricity, leading to a virtuous growth cycle profitable to both electricity providers and rural<lb/> communities. Such economic growth is obviously an important achievement of any rural<lb/> electrification programme. Some experts (<ref type="biblio">Barnes, 2007</ref>), however, warn that the necessary<lb/> conditions for such economic growth lie in the parallel or complementary development<lb/> programmes for the newly electrified communities. While electricity is indeed an important input to<lb/> rural businesses, farms or other small rural structures, adequate local conditions such as organised<lb/> rural markets and sufficient credit are necessary for such businesses to grow. Lack of such<lb/> complementary development programmes in these regions may hinder their economic growth.<lb/></p>

			<head>Technologies commonly used in rural electrification policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Socially, ethically and economically beneficial, the electrification of rural or remote areas is usually<lb/> high on the agenda of the leaders of major emerging economies, but the main problem to<lb/> overcome is the choice of the technology.<lb/></p>

			<p>The choice of a specific energy technology for rural electrification naturally depends on the targeted<lb/> country and on whether it is a whole region, community, business, farm or household that is to benefit<lb/> from the process. But this is not the only concern. Issues of customer and load density, relative distance<lb/> to the national or regional grid, landscape, availability of natural resources such as wind, sun, water,<lb/> forests, economic and financial aspects, availability and maturity of any chosen technology, all these<lb/> factors influence the decision maker in his choice of the technology or technology mix.<lb/></p>

			<p>The pool of potential energy technologies for rural electrification programmes is quite large and<lb/> each technology naturally varies in its generation technique, its costs, and in the quality of the<lb/> service it delivers. Depending in part on the degree of urbanisation of the targeted population,<lb/> energy technologies used in electrification programmes generally involve national or regional grid<lb/> extension, diesel generators, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), disposable batteries, kerosene lamps,<lb/> renewable energies (including photovoltaic systems, wind energy, hydropower, and new wave<lb/> energy and hydrogen) or hybrid systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>National or regional grid extension<lb/></head>

			<p>When aiming to electrify a rural community, the first question is its distance from a grid. If grid<lb/> extension appears to be relatively easy (the region is near to the grid, flat landscape), is cost-<lb/>competitive with respect to other local autogenerators, and if the region&apos;s load density is<lb/> considered sufficient, then grid extension will usually be a preferred option. In India for instance,<lb/> Page | 14<lb/> the first choice for a majority of the villages has been through grid extension. But many of the<lb/> dispersed rural communities did not meet all these criteria at once. Grid extension was then the<lb/> final phase of a sequential rural electrification process and other local electrification technologies<lb/> were chosen in the meantime. In fact, once demand was built over the years by means of auto-<lb/>generation, and it became economically feasible to connect to the central grid, grid extension was<lb/> chosen as a final step. Recently, however, mentalities have been changing and governments as well<lb/> as rural communities are beginning to see stand-alone systems as long-term and reliable options for<lb/> power generation, rendering grid extension less of a mandatory long-term means of electrification.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conventional systems<lb/></head>

			<p>Diesel generators, LPG, disposable batteries, paraffin (or kerosene) and biomass technologies have<lb/> all been conventional means for dispersed populations to have access to electricity services. Today<lb/> however, sustainability considerations are encouraging developing economies to focus their efforts,<lb/> where possible, in deploying cleaner energy technologies such as renewable and more sustainable<lb/> bioenergy applications. But diesel generators remain an attractive technology in rural<lb/> electrification, mainly used in hybrid systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>Renewable energy systems<lb/></head>

			<p>Often considered the optimal means of bringing electricity to rural areas that cannot be connected<lb/> to the grid, renewable energies offer notable environmental advantages over conventional fossil<lb/> fuel technologies. The most widely used renewable energy technologies for rural electrification are<lb/> described below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Photovoltaic (PV)</head>

			<p>power systems already provide electricity in developing countries to an estimated<lb/> minimum of 500 000 to 1 million rural households without access to the grid (International Finance<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Corporation, 2007</ref>). Particularly attractive for countries with ample sunlight and whose rural electricity<lb/> grid is poorly developed, PV systems can provide electricity to relatively dispersed populations but also<lb/> to groups of houses or entire villages. The most common systems used in rural areas in developing<lb/> countries are solar home systems (SHS), which have the potential to power light bulbs and small<lb/> appliances such as televisions, radios or fans. Generally the capacity of the units used in rural households<lb/> ranges from 30 to 100 peak watts, but their size varies (<ref type="biblio">Erickson &amp; Chapman, 1995</ref>). However, because<lb/> of the systems&apos; limited capacity, mechanisms are often needed to prevent excessive consumption by<lb/> users. Currently, there is a move towards solar-diesel hybrid-powered mini-grids.<lb/></p>

			<table>Photo 1: School in South Africa powered by a photovoltaic system<lb/> Source: Courtesy of Bernard Mc Nelis, IEA PVPS.<lb/> Wind energy has a very high potential for rural electrification thanks to its intrinsic characteristics.<lb/> Wind energy does not necessitate long-term centralised planning for its development as it is fast<lb/> and simple to install. In most rural settings, when several smaller wind turbines are installed rather<lb/> than a very large one, the grid can easily absorb wind generation. Successful examples of rural<lb/> electrification based on wind power are the Atlantic islands of Canary, Azores and Cape Verde,<lb/> where the high wind resource turns this renewable energy into among the most cost-effective<lb/> power plants to install and operate.<lb/></table>

			<p>Small hydropower projects already provide electricity to millions of people throughout the world,<lb/> with the largest deployment being in China. These power plants can vary in size from less than<lb/> 500 kW to about 10 MW and most are developed at the community level or for small industry. In<lb/> addition to electricity, they also provide mechanical energy for small businesses, drinking water and<lb/> irrigation through canals or pumps. While some small hydro plants use imported technology, there<lb/> is an increased reliance on local manufacture. This provides employment opportunities over and<lb/> above electricity to the communities. There remains a huge potential to increase the role of small<lb/> hydro in supplying electricity to small, rural populations. Mini-hydropower plants are however often<lb/> criticised for their inability to provide sufficient power to meet peak demand or for their excess<lb/> capacity during off-peak periods. In order to limit the financial burden due to such tensions,<lb/> consumers often have to either constrain their use of electricity during peak hours, or transfer their<lb/> demand on to off-peak hours.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bioenergy already provides the main source of energy for heating and cooking for many millions of<lb/> people in rural communities. Where adequate sources of biomass raw materials are available – for<lb/> example from crop or forest residues – then these can also be used to generate electricity. This can<lb/> be done in conjunction with larger plants which also use energy to process crops (for example the<lb/> use of bagasse in sugar cane production). Alternatively smaller-scale systems based on biomass<lb/> combustion or small-scale gasification can be used to generate electricity for local use. Moreover,<lb/> biofuels such as non-edible straight vegetable oils (SVOs) produced from plants like Jatropha, can be<lb/> directly used for transport applications and decentralised power generation or converted to<lb/> biodiesel and blended with petro-diesel.<lb/></p>

			<table>Photo 2: Transporting fuel wood in Brazil<lb/> Source: Courtesy J. Tustin, IEA Bioenergy IA.<lb/> Ocean energy could play a significant role in enabling sustainable energisation of rural coastal and<lb/> island regions of the developing countries by generating electricity, producing drinking water<lb/> through desalination, or food through aquaculture, and cooling. This would however require<lb/> appropriate policy instruments and real political will. Currently, project development activities are<lb/> at an early stage in China, India, and Indonesia for providing electricity to rural households by<lb/> harnessing energy from ocean waves and tidal currents. During 2007, Ponte di Archimede<lb/> International S.p.A. entered into three joint ventures with the People&apos;s Republic of China, Indonesia<lb/> Page | 16<lb/> and the Philippines to install tidal current-based generation in remote villages. The Research and<lb/> Technology Ministries in the respective countries participated actively in the formation of these<lb/> ventures. The installation of tidal current projects of a similar size in remote villages is currently<lb/> being planned in China and the Philippines. A 2 MW tidal current plant is being considered by India<lb/> to bring electricity to a remote area near Sunderban in West Bengal. A low-temperature ocean<lb/> thermal desalination (LTTD) plant has been operating since 2005 at Kavaratti in Lakshadweep<lb/> islands in western India and that provides 100 m 3 per day of drinking water to a local community.<lb/> There are also significant opportunities to utilise wave and tidal current energy for sustainable<lb/> energisation of remote coastal areas in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa and activities are already<lb/> under way in these countries.<lb/></table>

			<p>Hydrogen may well play a key role in distributed energy generation for which rural areas are prime<lb/> candidates. Hydrogen &quot;generators&quot; (small-scale portable power devices such as reformers and fuel<lb/> cells) may be substituted for the common diesel generators that are widely used. Hydrogen can also<lb/> be used as fuel to power backup devices (larger fuel cells) and to provide combined heat and power<lb/> (CHP). However, because it is innovative and new (at the demonstration and early market<lb/> introduction stages) the typical household in rural settings would not be appropriate for hydrogen<lb/> use. There are, however, some 400 stationary hydrogen demonstrations in the world. Unlike the<lb/> photovoltaic industry or solar water-heating and cooling and other alternative technology industries<lb/> which have started from scratch, hydrogen is already a large business with an infrastructure that<lb/> can kick-start production, storage, delivery or energy applications as the deployment process<lb/> continues. Hydrogen technologies may in the future bring innovation to the current supply of rural<lb/> electrification technologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Hybrid systems<lb/></head>

			<p>Hybrid systems are basically a combination of two or more different but complementary energy<lb/> supply systems located on the same site. The advantage of hybrid systems is their ability to avoid<lb/> fluctuations in the system&apos;s energy supply, which is the main disadvantage of stand-alone<lb/> renewable energy technologies such as wind and PV. A hybrid system will provide a relatively<lb/> constant delivery of energy even when one of the supply devices of the system is unable to<lb/> generate power (lack of wind in the case of a windmill or of sunlight in the case of a PV). Often,<lb/> hybrid systems will be a combination of different renewable energy technologies, sometimes<lb/> coupled with diesel gen-sets. Typical hybrid systems are photovoltaic/wind systems, wind/diesel<lb/> systems, wind/photovoltaic/micro hydropower systems, or wind/small hydropower and so forth.<lb/></p>

			<p>Typically, apart from local ambient conditions, economical and financial issues, the choice of which<lb/> energy technology or mix of technologies to use for rural electrification will depend on whether the<lb/> energy produced will be used for lighting or cooling purposes in a single household, or for<lb/> productive processes (irrigation pumping, water supplies, crop processing, refrigeration, etc.) of<lb/> businesses, agro-industries, small shops, and so on.<lb/></p>

			<head>A focus on government policies for rural electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>Most developing countries include rural electrification policies in their socio-political development<lb/> efforts. The existing economic inequalities between urban and rural populations and these<lb/> countries&apos; social equity objectives tend to be the main drivers to providing electricity access to<lb/> isolated populations. By doing this, governments of developing countries seek to improve the living<lb/> standards of their rural populations and help them economically in order to help level out<lb/> rural/urban disparities. Moreover, substantial upfront costs and long-term financial investments are<lb/> required to accelerate the pace of rural electrification. Such financial security depends on<lb/> government support.<lb/></p>

			<p>Efficient implementation of rural electrification programmes often needs regulations and market<lb/> reforms, including market incentives through increased competition for private involvement and<lb/> above all government involvement. Moreover, technical standards and norms can lead to an<lb/> oversizing or costly infrastructure set-up for the electrification of rural households or villages, which<lb/> will increase connection costs and the price of electricity. A reassessment of these standards and<lb/> norms at the government level may prove necessary to alleviate the unnecessary additional<lb/> financial burden from the electrification effort in rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following chapters will analyse countries where government-led rural electrification<lb/> programmes have been implemented. These countries are Brazil, China, India and South Africa.<lb/> Through benchmarking current achievements with previously set targets, we will infer the main<lb/> challenges faced by implementing bodies and how these have been addressed. The analysis of the<lb/> country chapters 5 bring forth the important issues that need to be considered and addressed for<lb/> the successful implementation of a rural electrification policy.<lb/></p>

			<head>1 Brazil<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the 1988 Constitution, the federal government of Brazil has been assuming full responsibility<lb/> for the distribution of electricity as an essential public service. As a consequence of strong political<lb/> will and the release of sufficient funds, in 2009 Brazil reached an overall electrification rate of<lb/> 97.8%. This rate was 99.5% in urban areas and 88 % in rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been<lb/> achieved largely through grid extension. Stand-alone systems may be more widely used in the<lb/> future. The country&apos;s energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described<lb/> below.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.1 Introduction and country description<lb/></head>

			<p>Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, covering an area of 8.5 million km 2 , equal to about<lb/> half of the</p>

			<table>South American continent. It is limited to its east and north by the Atlantic Ocean, its<lb/> inland frontiers border with all Southern American countries except for Chile and Ecuador<lb/> (Wikipedia, 2009a). Brazil belongs to the so-called megadiverse countries, a group that<lb/> encompasses about 70% of the planet&apos;s biodiversity (WCMC, 1992). Particularly notable are its large<lb/> tropical Amazon and Atlantic coast rainforests as well as the large peatlands (the Pantanal) of the<lb/> midwest. Brazil also extends over semi-arid areas in the north-east (the Sertão) and vast plains in<lb/> the south. It has one of the world&apos;s most extensive river systems, including the Amazon and São<lb/> Francisco rivers. Most of the country lies between 200 and 800 metres in elevation. The weather is<lb/> mainly tropical (Wikipedia, 2009a).<lb/> Economic data<lb/> Over the past years, Brazil has enjoyed a period of stable economic growth with significant social<lb/> and environmental advances. While the country did not escape the global economic downturn in<lb/> 2008, Brazil has been able to cope with the crisis by relying on sound macroeconomic policies, as<lb/> well as by expanding its social security net, infrastructure and housing investments (World Bank,<lb/> 2009a). Real GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) growth has averaged 4.5% over the 2000-2007<lb/> period (OECD, 2009) before growth prospects dropped to 0.5% in 2009 because of the crisis (World<lb/> Bank, 2009a). GDP/PPP attained USD 1 833 billion in 2007 (OECD, 2009) but is highly concentrated<lb/> in a few regions: the three major economic states of the south-east (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and<lb/> Minas Gerais) account for over half (54.4%) of GDP (IBGE, 2007a). 6 Brazil&apos;s main foreign trade<lb/> partners include the European Union, the United States, Mercosur members, as well as China.<lb/> Population and economic profile<lb/> In 2000 Brazil undertook a census which reported a population close to 170 million inhabitants<lb/> (IBGE, 2002). By 2007 this number had increased to nearly 190 million people, an increase of about<lb/> 20 million in only eight years. While the urban population has been constantly rising throughout<lb/> these years (from 142 million in 2001 to 160 million in 2006), the rural population has remained<lb/> relatively constant at 30 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2007b). 7 Estimations of population density show<lb/> much lower indices in rural areas (6.3 inhabitants/km 2 ) 8 than in urban areas (between 33.1 and<lb/> 36.8 inhabitants/km 2 ). 9 Of the total economically active population, the largest share works in<lb/> services (59.6%), followed by industry (28.0%) and agriculture (6.7%) (OECD, 2009).<lb/> There is no officially defined poverty line in Brazil; however, the concept of minimum wage is often<lb/> used in analyses. Accordingly, Silveira and Fernandes (2007) find that the number of indigent people<lb/> decreased from 12.4% in 2001 to about 7.6% in 2005, and the number of poor people from 28.7%<lb/> to 20.8%. 10 Brazil has thus already met the Millennium Development Goal of reducing substantially<lb/> the number of people living in poverty (World Bank, 2009a). Though poverty has been alleviated in<lb/> the past few years, extreme poverty still affects a large population, particularly in the country&apos;s<lb/> rural parts of the north-east (Presidency of the Republic, 2007; Silveira et al., 2007). Average rural<lb/> per-capita income is substantially lower than in urban areas: BRL 312 (USD 171) against BRL 689<lb/> (USD 377.5) (IBGE, 2007b</table>

			<p>). Furthermore, rural regions also display less access to public services,<lb/> such as lack of clean water, sanitation, health services, education, and particularly electricity supply,<lb/> further highlighting the gravity of the rural poverty problem (<ref type="biblio">Rosa et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy data<lb/></head>

			<table>Brazil&apos; energy matrix is based on a comparatively high use of renewable energy, including large-<lb/>scale hydropower for electricity generation and biofuels for transport (IEA, 2006; EPE, 2008). In<lb/> 2007, the country&apos;s overall energy consumption reached 216 million tonnes of oil equivalent<lb/> (Mtoe), with demand driven mainly by petroleum derivates (41.4%, particularly diesel oil and<lb/> gasoline), electricity (16.4%), and sugar cane bagasse (12.4%) (EPE, 2008). Owing to dramatically<lb/> increased production of petroleum, domestic dependence on oil imports has decreased sharply<lb/> over the past years (EPE, 2008; OECD, 2009). Brazil still imports considerable amounts of coal and,<lb/> to a lesser degree, electricity, the latter being obtained in particular from Argentina (EPE, 2008;<lb/> Costa et al., 2008).<lb/> Electricity generation<lb/> Overall domestic electricity supply increased by 5% between 2006 and 2007, reaching a total of<lb/> 483.4 TWh (EPE, 2008). This makes Brazil the largest electricity market in South America (IEA,<lb/> 2009c). Large hydroelectricity supplies 72.6% of all electricity, followed by thermoelectricity<lb/> generation (14.7%) (EPE<ref type="biblio">, 2008</ref>). Installed electricity generating capacity is around 100 GW (EPE,<lb/> 2008). It can be assumed that electricity consumption in rural areas is considerably lower than in<lb/> metropolitan areas. This holds particularly for the household sector where poverty levels are higher<lb/> and overall population is low.<lb/> Because of the strong reliance on large hydropower dams for electricity generation, most electric<lb/> energy today (98%) is supplied by the large regionally integrated grid transmission system (also<lb/> known as the Sistema Interligado Nacional, SIN) (<ref type="biblio">ESMAP, 2005</ref>). Only in the remote areas of the<lb/> Amazon, which cover about 45% of the Brazilian territory but with only 3% of the national<lb/> population, grid electrification has been in part replaced by decentralised electricity supply<lb/> alternatives: mainly small diesel plants supply isolated villages and towns at a total nominal capacity<lb/> of only about 3 GW (<ref type="biblio">Andrade, 2009a</ref>). The cost of electricity generation in these areas is high and<lb/> reaches USD 200/MWh (<ref type="biblio">ESMAP, 2005</ref>). This is mainly due to the high costs of fuel and<lb/> transportation (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004</ref>). The service is also weak, often because of the inefficient<lb/> functioning of old motors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutions involved in the power sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Brazil&apos;s electricity sector today is fully deregulated. Generators (mostly large government-controlled<lb/> companies, but also several private power producers) sell their electricity to distributors via<lb/> auctions. Electricity distribution is mainly operated by the private sector, whereas transmission is<lb/> both publicly and privately owned. The provision of electricity services relies on government<lb/> concessions, and the country is fully covered by either private or state-owned concession areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>Smaller regions are sometimes covered by authorised rural electrification cooperatives (ESMAP,<lb/> 2005). Institutionally, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) oversees the whole power sector<lb/> and is responsible for policy setting. The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL), operating<lb/> under the jurisdiction of the MME, regulates and controls the generation, transmission and<lb/> distribution of power in compliance with current legislation. Eletrobrás is a federally-owned holding<lb/> company for electricity assets, controlling a large part of electric power generation and transmission<lb/> systems mainly through six subsidiary companies, as well as some distribution capacity in the<lb/> Amazon area. The Empresa de Pesquisa Energética (EPE, or Energy Research Company) is<lb/> responsible for the development of integrated long-term planning of Brazil&apos;s power sector, thus<lb/> supporting MME&apos;s national energy policy and long-term planning.<lb/></p>

			<head>Urban-rural electricity access<lb/></head>

			<table>Access to electricity in rural areas has widened strongly throughout the past years. By 2007,<lb/> 55.35 million out of a total 56.34 million permanent residences were connected to electric energy.<lb/> In 2009, the overall Brazilian electrification rate reached 97.8%. The rate is 99.5% in urban areas<lb/> and 88 % in rural areas, putting Brazil among the group of Latin American countries with near-<lb/>universal electricity access (IEA, 2009b). The Ministry of Mines and Energy expects that electricity<lb/> will be available in every single Brazilian household by 2010. A few years ago, only 73% of the rural<lb/> population had access to electricity and 12 million people in 2.5 million households were still<lb/> without electricity (ESMAP, 2005).<lb/></table>

			<head>1.2 Institutional structures for rural electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 recognises the distribution of electricity as an essential public<lb/> service, for which the federal government is to assume full responsibility, either directly or through<lb/> designated concessions or permits (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004</ref>). 11 Up to the 1990s, rural electrification<lb/> policies were often implemented at the state level, using state treasury resources, and having the<lb/> programmes implemented by concessionaires controlled by state governments (ESMAP, 2005;<lb/> Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Besides these activities, a number of international donors as well as<lb/> non-governmental organisations supported or implemented several non-sectoral and decentralised<lb/> electrification projects in Brazil, with institutional set-ups and responsibilities varying considerably<lb/> between the different programmes (see <ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Zerriffi, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>1.2.1 Major electrification programmes<lb/></head>

			<p>Two</p>

			<table>large federal-led rural electrification programmes – PRODEEM (Programa de Desenvolvimento<lb/> Energético de Estados e de Municípios, or Energy Development Programme of States and<lb/> Municipalities) and Luz no Campo (LnC, Light in the Countryside) – were established in 1994 and<lb/> 2000 respectively, however without a clear target for reaching universal access in rural areas.<lb/> Because no specialised federal rural electrification agency existed, PRODEEM and LnC were co-<lb/>ordinated by different actors: LnC by Eletrobrás under coordination of the MME, and PRODEEM<lb/> directly by the MME. Both programmes also drew funding from different sources, the National<lb/> Treasury Funds in the case of PRODEEM, and Reserva Global de Reversão (Global Reversion<lb/> Reserve, or RGR) loans for utilities in the case of LnC (Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005). The<lb/> Page | 23<lb/> RGR was implemented as early as 1971 and has been managed by Eletrobrás. About one-fourth of<lb/> the available RGR resources are set aside by law for low-income consumers in rural areas (ESMAP,<lb/> 2005). There were no other significant federal rural electrification funds.<lb/> In 2003 the current rural electrification programme, Luz para Todos (Light for All, or LpT), which is<lb/> to give universal access in the country&apos;s rural areas by 2010, was formalised and implemented. The<lb/> programme is based on the obligation for service providers to universalise rural electricity access<lb/> (as set by the Brazilian Constitution), on substantial federal and state resources for the service<lb/> providers, and on low tariffs for low-income and rural consumers (Zerriffi, 2007; Poppe, 2009).<lb/></table>

			<head>1.2.2 Institutional structure – implementation and funding<lb/></head>

			<p>On</p>

			<table>11 November 2003, LpT was inaugurated. LpT&apos;s original aim was universal access to electricity in<lb/> all rural areas of Brazil by 2008, keeping in mind the five-year deadline defended by ANEEL. In total<lb/> numbers, Lpt was to provide two million rural connections (MME, 2003; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009)<lb/> for free to yet unattended consumers, where each household would also receive an &quot; internal kit &quot;<lb/> containing several power plugs, lamps, and other necessary material (Eletrobrás and MME, 2009).<lb/> Because of the surge of new demands for rural electrification not identified when the programme<lb/> started and for other reasons, the original LpT deadline was postponed to 2010 (Eletrobrás and<lb/> MME, 2009).<lb/> With LpT, a new institutional structure for rural electrification emerged, in which the Regulatory Agency<lb/> ANEEL (established during the electricity sector restructuring process during the 1990s) and Eletrobrás<lb/> play pivotal roles. ANEEL is responsible for the authorisation of concessionaires and other service<lb/> providers (which generally occurs through bidding processes among interested actors) (ESMAP<ref type="biblio">, 2005</ref>).<lb/> ANEEL also sets and verifies the annual electrification targets for LpT. Eletrobrás, on the other hand,<lb/> holds the operational secretariat of the programme. This includes carrying out the technical and<lb/> financial analyses of the connections to be installed by the service providers, the allocation of funds to<lb/> these actors, and the supervision of the installations. As with LnC, the MME co-ordinates the<lb/> development of the LpT programme and sets its general policies. Several decision and advisory councils<lb/> at federal and state levels support the institutional structure for rural electrification, dealing with various<lb/> issues such as the promotion of productive uses of energy in newly connected municipalities or the<lb/> setting-up of priority lists for rural electrification operations. These councils generally involve a great<lb/> variety of stakeholders which, depending on the level of the council (federal or state), may include<lb/> representatives from the MME, other ministries, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, local municipalities, unions, and the<lb/> service providers (<ref type="biblio">Eletrobrás, 2008; Eletrobrás and MME, 2009</ref>). 12<lb/></p>

			<p>State governments support the federal government&apos;s LpT universalisation strategy by providing part<lb/> of the funds – in the form of grants to the service providers – to finance operations. These<lb/> contributions are on average in the order of 10% of total LpT investments (Instituto Acende Brasil,<lb/> 2007a). The main funding sources, however, still come from the federal government: through RGR<lb/> grants and loans (at low interest rates) and grants from the newly implemented Conta de<lb/> Desenvolvimento Energético (Energy Development Account, or CDE) (<ref type="biblio">Strazzi et al., 2008</ref>). RGR is<lb/> funded by annual levies on investments by concessionaires, while the CDE was implemented in<lb/></p>

			<table>2002 specifically for creating a new instrument to finance the universalisation of rural electricity<lb/> access in Brazil. 13 CDE resources come from a variety of sources, including payments for the use of<lb/> Page | 24<lb/> public assets, fines by ANEEL to concessionaires and permit-holders, and annual quotas paid by<lb/> electricity sellers (ESMAP, 2005). 14 The concessionaires&apos; participation in financing the operations is<lb/> defined together with the MME and Eletrobrás, and varies on average between 10% and 15%<lb/> (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). As connection costs within LpT are totally free for rural consumers,<lb/> in general any long-run costs occurring to the service providers (operation and management,<lb/> capital, and replacement costs) following electrification are to be covered by the service providers<lb/> themselves through electricity tariffs (ESMAP, 2005; Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). These tariffs<lb/> are subsidised for small consumption levels. More than a third of residential customers (35%) in<lb/> Brazil belong to the low consumer tariff sub-class. A total of 77% of the low-income consumers use<lb/> up to 80 kWh of electricity per month and 23% between 80 and 220 kWh. Low-income consumers<lb/> represent 43% of total consumers in the north, 62% in the north-east, 25% both in the south-east<lb/> and the south, and 29% in the midwest (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b).<lb/> Tariff increases due to LpT had been limited to 8% in 2005, so that concessionaires and other<lb/> service providers have limited possibilities to recover their operation and management costs in the<lb/> long run (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a).<lb/></table>

			<head>1.3 Description of current electrification programmes and<lb/> objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>Interestingly enough the creation of a programme aiming to provide universal access to electricity in<lb/> Brazil gained force exactly at a time when two federal-led rural electrification programmes (LnC and<lb/> PRODEEM) were still in their implementation phase. 15 Most centralised concessionaires did not have<lb/> clear univeralisation targets, and particularly privately run concessionaires (with tight budget<lb/> constraints) had little interest in promoting rural electrification because of the high costs of supplying<lb/> electricity services to low-consuming, remote and dispersed households, which would make cost<lb/> recovery of the investments extremely difficult (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004; Obermaier, 2005</ref>).<lb/> As they were unable to reach substantial progress regarding rural electrification, as early as 2000 the<lb/> authorities formed the idea of a universal electricity access programme that would supply electricity to<lb/> all rural properties in Brazil within a five-year period (<ref type="biblio">Cortez and Rosillo-Calle, 2001; Poppe, 2002</ref>).<lb/> Particularly taken forward by ANEEL, the following discussions, involving a large variety of stakeholders<lb/> (including representatives from other ministries, MME, Eletrobrás, ANEEL, development banks,<lb/> associations of concessionaires, rural electrification co-operatives, renewable energy trade associations,<lb/> earlier power sector fund. In fact, financial contributions for the CDE remained at the same level compared<lb/> with its predecessor (<ref type="biblio">Poppe, 2009</ref>).<lb/> 14 Other important resources come from the fuel compensation account (CCC, or Conta de Consumo de<lb/> Combustíveis), which is a levy on all Brazilian electricity consumers. Today it primarily finances thermal<lb/> generation via diesel in the Amazon region (ESMAP, 2005).<lb/> 15 Both programmes were criticised throughout their implementation: LnC financed grid electrification for<lb/> some 600 thousand households living near a grid all over Brazil over a period of three years, falling short of<lb/> the initial one million households target as well as in providing inexpensive electrification (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al.,<lb/> 2004; ESMAP, 2005</ref>). The PRODEEM programme provided mainly non-grid solar PV electrification to<lb/> community installations, health facilities and schools. Top-down management with little local stakeholder<lb/> involvement, lack of cost-recovery schemes, and lack of co-ordination with grid electrification plans severely<lb/> affected the results of PRODEEM (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004; ESMAP, 2005; Costa et al., 2008</ref>).<lb/> universities and research centres, and non-governmental organisations), eventually led to the<lb/> formalisation and implementation of the federal Luz para Todos programme (ESMAP, 2005). 16<lb/></table>

			<head>1.3.1 Luz para Todos targets and achievements<lb/></head>

			<p>LpT prioritises investments that focus on productive uses of electricity and integrated local<lb/> development projects − community production centres, water wells, health clinics and schools −<lb/> but also seeks to service municipalities that had been left aside by the previous electrification<lb/> efforts, such as indigenous areas, settlements, as well as areas with lower-than-average human<lb/> development indices (HDI), regions where inhabitants are affected by hydropower dams, etc. (see<lb/> Eletrobrás and MME, 2009, for the complete priority list). The target groups for rural electrification<lb/> thus live mainly in the northern and north-eastern states of the country where electricity access at<lb/> the beginning of LpT was lowest in both nominal and relative numbers: in the north-east 1.1 million<lb/> rural households (34.4% of all rural households in the region), and in the north 447 thousand rural<lb/> households (59.7% of all rural households in that region) lacked access to electric energy.<lb/> Altogether, both regions thus accounted for more than 75% of the originally planned installations<lb/> within LpT (<ref type="biblio">Obermaier, 2005; ESMAP, 2005</ref>); both rural regions are also those with higher poverty<lb/> rates and less access to other basic services (<ref type="biblio">Rosa et al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

When<lb/> it started, the LpT programme had considerable difficulties in keeping up with the tight schedule set<lb/> by ANEEL: already by 2005 the deficit of electricity connections had reached nearly 270 thousand<lb/> households. Inexperience with LpT, political and administrative interferences, as well as supply<lb/> shortages of material and services including cables, posts, etc. caused by the explosion of demand<lb/> may explain part of these delays (Andrade, 2009b). In 2006, however, LpT&apos;s actual installations<lb/> surpassed planned installations, and thus led to a declining deficit. In 2008, LpT was about<lb/> 65 thousand installations short of the original targets. Finally, the pace of electrification is estimated<lb/> to increase substantially until 2010, with 510 thousand new installations planned for 2009 and<lb/> 578 thousand more for 2010, which is far above what had been realised the years before. These<lb/> planned connections correspond mainly to the newly identified rural electrification demand – the<lb/> original LpT target of two million installations had nearly been met in 2008 with 1.88 million<lb/> connections.<lb/> At the beginning of LpT, Dilma Rousseff, Minister of the MME, defined LpT as &quot; a proposal to reduce<lb/> poverty and hunger, using electricity as a vector for development &quot; (MME, 2003, author&apos;s own<lb/> translation). This statement underlines that rural electrification is prioritised as a key objective of<lb/> Brazil&apos;s overall poverty alleviation strategy (ESMAP<ref type="biblio">, 2005</ref>), particularly regarding social inclusion of<lb/> the rural poor (<ref type="biblio">Goldemberg et al., 2004</ref>). While prior rural electrification initiatives had<lb/> concentrated mostly on increasing access to infrastructure, it was decreed that a universal access<lb/> strategy should also encompass electricity consumption so as to enable the beneficiaries to use<lb/> electricity as an instrument for economic and social development (<ref type="biblio">Obermaier, 2005</ref>). Electricity use<lb/> for the rural poor is promoted essentially through lower tariffs for low-consumption classes, the<lb/> idea being that low consumption is correlated with low income (<ref type="biblio">Zerriffi, 2007</ref>). 17<lb/></p>

			<head>1.3.2 Means of electrification under the LpT<lb/></head>

			<p>In the operational manual of LpT, three technological options are listed to provide electricity to<lb/> rural households: i) extension of grid distribution lines, ii) decentralised generation in isolated grids,<lb/> and iii) individual systems. Despite these different possibilities for service providers, the Brazilian<lb/> electrification model is primarily based on extension of the grid (<ref type="biblio">Reiche et al., 2006; Zerriffi, 2007;<lb/> Andrade, 2009b</ref>). At least during the first years of LpT, grid extensions have often been the least-<lb/>cost option for the utility (<ref type="biblio">Zerriffi, 2007</ref>). Thus until 2009, 4.62 million posts, 883 thousand km of<lb/> cable, and 708 thousand transformers have been installed within the universalisation strategy<lb/> (MME, 2009b).<lb/> Large reliance on grid extension to attain universal rural access may not be economical in the future<lb/> as LpT is now expected to reach out to the marginally more remote and dispersed consumers away<lb/> from the existing distribution lines (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a; Andrade, 2009b). 18 Nevertheless,<lb/> according to MME, the remaining one million connections planned for 2009 and 2010 (see Table 1)<lb/> will still be realised largely through extensions of the grid. It should be noted that already under the<lb/> LnC phase, lack of incentives to provide low-cost connections and non-grid electrification had been<lb/> perceived (Goldemberg et al., 2004). Connection costs may reach USD 4 000 and more if population<lb/> density is low and consumers are dispersed. These costs are well above any international<lb/> benchmark, and electrification options other than grid extensions may provide much cheaper<lb/> alternatives in such cases (ESMAP, 2005; Reiche et al., 2006).<lb/> Renewable energy has been used very little in the beginning of LpT (Pertusier, 2004). Even by end of<lb/> 2006, only around 3 100 solar home systems (SHS) had been installed under LpT, although it had<lb/> been estimated that for 17 500 localities – translating into some 130 000 systems – such systems<lb/> would be the most cost-effective option (IEA, 2009d). Decentralised renewable electrification<lb/> options, by either individual systems or mini-grids, could play a more relevant role during the 2009-<lb/>2010 period, particularly in the remote and isolated villages of the Amazon region. There are still<lb/> many rural isolated communities in the Amazon that cannot be assisted by the conventional<lb/> system. 19 However, the use of expensive diesel generators in this region is still the norm (Andrade,<lb/> 2009b). It is estimated that in the Amazon region 80% of the unattended communities have less<lb/> than 30 households (Amazonas Energia, 2009), and very few settlements have more than<lb/> 100 inhabitants. Because of the distance from the main transmission and distribution lines, grid<lb/> extension for these communities is economically unviable. With the publication of the<lb/> February 2009 Manual de Projetos Especiais</table>

			<p>of the MME (a special projects manual that establishes<lb/> technical and financial criteria to be applied for electricity services through renewable energies), the<lb/> choice between which renewable energy technology to use, such as solar PV systems, wind and<lb/> hybrid power plants, thermal power plants powered by natural gas or biofuels, mini and micro-<lb/>hydro systems, and vegetable palm oil as a replacement for diesel imports will be done according to<lb/> local conditions (MME, 2009d). However, at the moment only 23 special projects are being analysed<lb/> by Eletrobrás, and there is a strong concern that diesel generators will continue to be used to attain<lb/> universalisation targets if current projects fail to go beyond their pilot testing phase.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs<lb/></head>

			<p>For the ambitious targets of LpT a significant budget was set up during its implementation phase. As the<lb/> LpT programme was a partnership between the federal government, the states and the concessionaires,<lb/> funding resources were to be divided among the various actors, with the federal government taking up the<lb/> largest share (71.5% of investments are covered by the federal government&apos;s power sector funds, 13% by<lb/> the states and 15.5% by the concessionaires). The federal government&apos;s power sector funds direct more<lb/> resources on loans to states with lower electrification rates and in greater need of investment, and fewer<lb/> to regions whose rates are much higher. Initially LpT total costs were estimated at BRL 7.6 billion<lb/> (USD 4.16 billion), with Energy Deelopment Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion Reserve (RGR) funds<lb/> contributing BRL 5.3 (USD 2.9 billion) or around 75% to the overall budget, and the remainder being split in<lb/> equal shares between the states and the service providers (MME, 2003). According to the calculations<lb/> made at the time, investments were to be particularly high in the northern and north-eastern states of the<lb/> country: with BRL 1.73 billion (USD 0.94 billion) and BRL 2.64 billion (USD 1.44 billion) respectively, these<lb/> states would account for over two-thirds of the total planned investments (<ref type="biblio">Loureiro de Azeredo, 2004</ref>).<lb/> When implementation of LpT began, however, overall costs soon increased significantly. By 2007, total<lb/> contracted rural electrification operations had already reached BRL 8.69 billion (USD 4.76 billion) (<ref type="biblio">Instituto<lb/> Acende Brasil, 2007a</ref>), implying that the originally planned budget had already been overstepped even<lb/> though rural connections were still significantly behind schedule at that time (about a 125 thousand<lb/> connections short, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Current MME estimates (MME, 2009c) show that the LpT budget has<lb/> further increased: the federal share is now at BRL 9.1 billion (USD 5 billion), with total investment costs<lb/> estimated at BRL 12.7 billion (USD 7 billion). Therefore, in only six years, estimated LpT costs have<lb/> increased by 67% over the original BRL 7.6 billion (USD 4.16 billion) initially projected.<lb/></p>

			<p>Increased demand for connections in rural areas (one million connections more than initially identified)<lb/> may be responsible for a large share of the cost increases, but it is also likely that electrification costs<lb/> were simply underestimated from the start.</p>

			<table>The technical standards for rural electricity connections did<lb/> indeed change since LpT implementation in 2003 (compare Eletrobrás and MME, 2005 and 2009), but it<lb/> is unclear whether these changes had any significant impact on the overall programme costs. 20<lb/></table>

			<head>1.4.1 Framework conditions and business incentives<lb/></head>

			<p>Eletrobrás, through the Eletrobrás&apos; Control system, is in charge of contract management and<lb/> supervision, from the establishment of the contracts to the transfer of funds. Eletrobrás uses its<lb/> own monitoring methodology, carrying out sample inspections on site. At the state level, a State<lb/> Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the communities, and monitors the<lb/> implementation of prioritised works.<lb/></p>

			<p>To facilitate smooth implementation of the LpT, minimise misusage of funds, reduce the risk of disruption<lb/> of the work, and advance the disbursement by the concessionaires, financial transfers 21 in the case of grid<lb/> extension are conducted as described in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/></p>

Total funds are released according to the<lb/> timeline presented in Table 3.<lb/></table>

			<head>1.4.2 Customer tariffs<lb/></head>

			<p>Beneficiaries of LpT usually pay discounted consumer tariffs owing to their low consumption level.<lb/> These so-called &quot; social tariffs &quot; are not linked to LpT, but available also to urban consumers. Those<lb/> who use up to 30 kWh per month pay only 35% of the regular residential tariff, while those<lb/> consuming between 31 kWh and 80 kWh per month pay the reduced tariff of 60% of the regular<lb/> residential tariff. Under certain circumstances a 10% discount can be obtained even by consumers<lb/> who use less than 140 kWh/month to 220 kWh/month (with the upper limit varying regionally), but<lb/> who must also prove that they have a low income. In the states of the north and the north-east 43%<lb/> and 62% of all consumers fall within the social tariff classes, which are the highest rates for all Brazil<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007b</ref>). It should be noted that these regions also display the highest<lb/> poverty indices and lowest access rates to a variety of public services. Although low income does<lb/> not always correlate with low consumption levels, recently connected households that live below or<lb/> near the poverty line rarely consume high amounts of electricity</p>

			<table>but rather around 30 to 40 kWh<lb/> per month (Obermaier, 2005 and 2009).<lb/> In 2007, the average electricity tariff in Brazil was BRL 252.91/MWh (USD 138.5/MWh), with<lb/> residential consumers paying BRL 293.59/MWh (USD 160.8/MWh) and industrial consumers paying<lb/> BRL 216.61/MWh (USD 118.7/MWh).<lb/> 1.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed<lb/> Management of the networks<lb/> The LpT programme was created from an already consolidated electricity sector structure, with<lb/> concessionaires having to abide by their system operation and maintenance obligations and to<lb/> Page | 30<lb/> follow the regulations in force. A concessionaire is therefore responsible for the management of the<lb/> installed networks, unless it has transferred its obligations to a permit-holder, for example. In the<lb/> case of isolated and remote communities in the Amazon (where costs are extremely high)<lb/> independent producers (that is without a concession) may become the main actors in supplying and<lb/> maintaining rural electricity services. The Special Projects Manual of the MME (MME, 2009d) sets<lb/> the technical, financial and management criteria for the use of renewable energy technologies in<lb/> electrification of isolated communities.<lb/></table>

			<head>Means for future capacity expansion<lb/></head>

			<p>The focus on household electrification under the LpT programme seems to have led sometimes to<lb/> an undersizing of capacity, including isolated diesel generators in the Amazon region and solar PV<lb/> systems (<ref type="biblio">Zerriffi, 2007</ref>). However, no further commitments have been made by the Brazilian<lb/> government regarding future capacity expansion once universal electricity access has been reached.<lb/> Given the unfavourable economics of rural electrification, it can thus be expected that no further<lb/> efforts will be made in the near future to increase loads. If consumers desire better-quality supply,<lb/> they would have to contact their service providers directly.<lb/></p>

			<head>Revenue collection<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the challenges of the LpT programme is to bring electricity to remote and isolated areas,<lb/> such as in the north, where the programme has not achieved its goal. The current concern is that<lb/> concessionaires may have difficulties in collecting bills in systems that use renewable energies. For<lb/> this reason, the 2009 Special Projects Manual (MME, 2009d) encourages projects that include a<lb/> prepaid solution, whereby consumers pay in advance for the electricity they expect to use, and<lb/> within their financial capacity. Moreover, remote monitoring computer systems are being<lb/> connected to central systems for better supervision.<lb/></p>

			<head>Involvement of the rural communities in the decision-making process<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the LpT, rural dwellers themselves request the installation of electricity directly to the<lb/> concessionaires. These requests are then analysed and prioritised by State Management<lb/> Committees (CGE) according to the characteristics of the locality. To date, 26 Brazilian states have<lb/> State Management Committees, which are composed of members of the federal government, the<lb/> state government, the concessionaires and rural electrification co-operatives, regulatory agencies,<lb/> mayors and the civil society. These committees meet regularly to assess requests and prioritise<lb/> work. The involvement of the civil society is fundamental in the electrification process, as it<lb/> improves the planning and implementation process and gives communities a sense of ownership of<lb/> the electrification process.<lb/></p>

			<head>Progress monitoring<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned before, Eletrobrás uses its own monitoring methodology through on-site inspections.<lb/> At the state level, a State Managing Committee reviews and prioritises the needs of the targeted<lb/> communities, and monitors the implementation of the works. This monitoring is linked to the<lb/> release of funds for further works, and allows to follow-up the work of the concessionaires.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implementation of other policies in parallel to the LpT<lb/></head>

			<p>The Commissão Nacional de Universalização (National Universalisation Commission, CNU), which is<lb/> part of the LpT institutional structure and formed by Brazilian federal ministries, including the MME,<lb/> the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and the Regulatory Agency ANEEL, establishes policies and<lb/> directives for electricity use to promote integrated rural development. The MME has also<lb/> established united action protocols with other ministries so as to facilitate the improvement or<lb/> even the creation of basic health and education services, water supply, and communication in the<lb/> communities, along with rural electrification. The Brazilian Bolsa Família income transfer<lb/> programme and other recent activities such as a social housing project or the national biodiesel<lb/> programme are examples of policies designed for the same groups targeted by LpT, namely the<lb/> rural poor. Together, these activities may lead to a more sustainable rural economic development.<lb/></p>

			<p>More direct actions under LpT include the construction of so-called Centros Comunitários de<lb/> Produção (CCP), community centres which are to promote a rational and efficient use of electricity<lb/> for productive purposes. Initially CCPs were to be installed throughout Brazil (MME, 2003) but the<lb/> total number is expected to be relatively low. For example, Eletrobrás has so far managed to<lb/> establish only three CCPs, none of which is located in remote and poor municipalities. The MME is<lb/> currently in the process of contracting specialists which are to work directly with CCPs, so that more<lb/> efforts in this regard can be expected.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2008, the federal government launched the Programa Territórios da Cidadania (Territories of<lb/> Citizenship Programme). This programme is a joint ministerial effort to promote economic growth<lb/> through territorial development to improve the quality of life of the people living in rural or poor<lb/> regions. The MME has joined other ministries in this effort currently implemented in 120 selected<lb/> territories and to be ended in 2010.<lb/></p>

			<p>The LpT programme makes hardly any room for energy efficiency policies. There is only one<lb/> example in the current version of the LpT operational manual, which states that the complete kit to<lb/> be installed with the electricity connection will contain fluorescent lamps which are more efficient<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Eletrobrás and MME, 2009</ref>). Otherwise, no comprehensive approach seems to have been taken to<lb/> ensure efficient energy use by the new consumers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other country-specific challenges and how they were addressed<lb/></head>

			<p>Several country-specific challenges regarding LpT rural electrification were identified: i) reaching<lb/> universal access by concessionaires that in some cases are in great financial difficulties, ii) finding<lb/> technological and organisational solutions for the Amazon region, and iii) ensuring long-term<lb/> sustainability of the programme once funds have run out. Most of these challenges had been<lb/> identified even before LpT was implemented. Given that they have not been addressed properly,<lb/> most problems remain (<ref type="biblio">Poppe, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The concessionaires have access to the Energy Development Accounts (CDE) and Global Reversion<lb/> Reserve (RGR) funds as well as to state subsidies in order to finance installations for rural<lb/> consumers to receive free electricity access under LpT. According to the overall funding schemes,<lb/> fewer subsidies are granted to states with higher electrification rates and where electrification can<lb/> be achieved at lower cost, whereas states with low rural access and higher costs receive larger<lb/> federal subsidies. Such flexibility allows for relatively uniform tariffs throughout the country, so that<lb/> customers in remote places do not have to pay disproportionately high bills because they are<lb/> difficult to reach by the concessionaires or other service providers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Combined with this, in some cases, a concessionaire may have many consumers with low<lb/> consumption levels to whom the so-called social tariffs apply. These discounted tariffs make cost<lb/> recovery extremely difficult even with LpT subsidies, particularly for utilities that in addition have<lb/> low rates of rural electricity access (ESMAP, 2005). In these cases, privately owned concessionaires<lb/> often charge their wealthier, urban consumers higher tariffs in order to cross-subsidise rural<lb/> consumers. Public concessionaires with softer budget constraints are usually allowed to show<lb/> losses, thus reducing the need to cross-subsidise (<ref type="biblio">Zerriffi, 2007</ref>). However, as the current rural<lb/> electrification strategy could well lead to rapidly rising electricity tariffs, the tariff impact of LpT was<lb/> limited to 8%, which in turn strongly affected the concessionaires&apos; ability to proceed with rural<lb/> electrification. In case the tariff impact would rise above 8%, original universalisation schedules<lb/> would have to be postponed until the conditions within the concession area had improved, insofar<lb/> as continued electrification could be undertaken without going beyond the 8% limit. In fact, since<lb/> 2005 there have been twelve cases of concessionaires that had to interrupt their rural<lb/> electrification programmes before reaching universal access because of this restriction (Instituto<lb/> Acende Brasil, 2007a).<lb/> Furthermore, ensuring cost recovery under LpT poses problems. Service providers are likely to still<lb/> require subsidies even after LpT reaches its universalisation target. This is because costs for<lb/> operation and management, capital and replacement have to be incorporated into the calculations<lb/> by the service providers (Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007a). Where low consumption levels remain,<lb/> concessionaires are expected to face serious problems, especially if they are already in financial<lb/> difficulties. Finally, it should be noted that the current model also creates problems in case of a<lb/> greater use of distributed generation technologies. For example, independent producers<lb/> implementing mini-grids are unlikely to use cross-subsidisation mechanisms when the consumer<lb/> base is small, thus making it impossible for the producer to charge the social tariffs (<ref type="biblio">Zerriffi, 2007</ref>).<lb/> Finally, the rural isolated communities, located for the most part in the Amazon region, will be<lb/> serviced through the guidelines of the Special Manual Projects. But since these guidelines have<lb/> been released at a very late stage (in <ref type="biblio">2009</ref>), only a few projects have yet been undertaken.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.6 Rural electrification progress, assessment and conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The Brazilian LpT rural electrification programme is now well known internationally because of its<lb/> ambitious targets and its success in carrying out the necessary investments and installations. In<lb/> Brazil, LpT was since its beginning considered as one of the few programmes with the potential to<lb/> significantly improve living conditions in rural Brazil (Loureiro de <ref type="biblio">Azeredo, 2004</ref>). While operations<lb/> have been lagging behind the originally agreed universalisation plans, the current pace of LpT<lb/> installations is such that the 2010 deadline is within reach. In June 2009, the number of connections<lb/> had surpassed two million so that over ten million people have now benefited directly from LpT.<lb/> The original target (two million rural connections) established in 2003 has been met. However,<lb/> reaching universal access in the poorer and sparsely populated northern and north-eastern states<lb/> has proven to be a more difficult task (<ref type="biblio">Instituto Acende Brasil, 2007; Poppe, 2009</ref>). It is estimated<lb/> that up to 2010 another million connections will be brought to the rural areas of Brazil, benefiting<lb/> to some five more million people (Presidency of the <ref type="biblio">Republic, 2009</ref>). Considerable difficulties can be<lb/> expected for this last million connections, as grid electrification may no longer be a feasible option<lb/> for many communities, particularly in the Amazon region. According to the MME, grid extension will<lb/> continue to play a substantial role in connecting the remaining one million households within LpT.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 China<lb/></head>

			<p>China, with strong political will, extended its electricity grids and exploited the country&apos;s<lb/> hydropower and solar potential. China achieved an electrification rate of 99.4% in 2009, with rural<lb/> areas reaching 99% and urban areas 100% (IEA, 2009b). Over the last ten years, rural electrification<lb/> has slowed down because of nearly complete nationwide electrification. The emphasis is put on<lb/> modernisation, service and quality improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of<lb/> innovative technology solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western<lb/> regions of the country. China will now focus mainly on the use of decentralised power systems to<lb/> supply, by the end of 2020, most of the people who are still without electricity.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Introduction and country description<lb/></head>

			<p>China, with a land area of 9.6 million square kilometres, is the world&apos;s third-largest country by<lb/> geographical extent. China, with 22 147 km of land boundaries, shares its borders with a total of<lb/> 14 countries, namely, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos,<lb/> Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Vietnam. China is characterised by<lb/> three climatic zones: tropical, subtropical and temperate.<lb/></p>

			<head>Economic data and investment<lb/></head>

			<p>In</p>

			<table>2008, China&apos;s economy grew by 9%, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of USD 4 400 billion<lb/> (bn). The primary sector amounted to USD 501.6 bn (11.3% of GDP), the secondary sector to<lb/> USD 2 138.4 bn (48.6% of GDP) and the tertiary sector to USD 1 764.4 bn (40.1% of GDP) (National<lb/> Bureau of Statistics China, 2009). If measured in purchasing power parity (PPP), China&apos;s GDP grew to<lb/> USD 7 903 bn in 2008, ranking second after the United States (World Bank, 2009b).<lb/> In China, foreign investment is generally driven by directives from the central government that sets<lb/> detailed rules for numerous parameters such as technology, location and investment size. China<lb/> proactively guides and encourages foreign investments in new and renewable energies, while<lb/> restricting investment in conventional coal-fired power plants. At present, procedures for approval<lb/> of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects are in accordance with the &quot; Regulation on Guiding the<lb/> Direction of Foreign Investment &quot; (February 2002, Decree of the State Council) and with the<lb/> &quot; Decision of the State Council on the Reform of Investment System &quot; , July 2004).<lb/></table>

			<p>With respect to investment in energy structures, under &quot; The Directory of Industry for Foreign<lb/> Investment &quot; (revised in 2007), foreign investment is encouraged in &quot; the construction and operation<lb/> of hydropower stations, giving priority to electricity &quot; , and &quot; the construction and operation of new<lb/> energy power stations (including solar energy, wind energy, magnetic energy, geothermal energy,<lb/> tidal and wave energy, biomass energy, etc.) &quot; . Foreign investment is prohibited in &quot; the construction<lb/> and operation of coal-fired steam-condensing power plants with the stand-alone capacity of<lb/> 300 000 kilowatts (kW) and below, the coal-fired dual units of steam-condensing and extracting,<lb/> heat and power co-generation plants with the stand-alone capacity of 100 000 kW and below,<lb/> outside the range of Tibet, Xinjiang, Hainan minor power grids &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<head>Population and its economic profile<lb/></head>

			<p>With</p>

			<table>a total population of 1 325 bn people in 2008 (World Bank, 2009c), China ranks first in the<lb/> world. Almost half of the population (45%) live in cities while 55 % live in rural areas. In the past,<lb/> Page | 36<lb/> subject to a strict local residence permit system, domestic migration from rural to urban areas was<lb/> nearly impossible. In recent years, rural to urban migration has been more prominent. In this<lb/> context, latest estimates suggest that China&apos;s urbanisation rate will increase by nearly 1% per year<lb/> during the next 15 to 20 years, which represents around 300 million people who will move from<lb/> rural areas into cities (China Daily, 2009). Today, China&apos;s average population density is<lb/> approximately 138 per km 2 (Wikipedia, 2009b), but with extreme variations in rural population<lb/> densities, ranging from less than one to more than 400 per km 2 . In stark contrast, the highest urban<lb/> population density per km 2 is 50 000 to 60 000 as in the case of central Beijing, Shanghai and<lb/> Chongqing (China Daily, 2009).<lb/> Of the total working population, 40.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.8 % in industry and 32.4% in<lb/> services (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2008). With China&apos;s rapid economic development,<lb/> the income of Chinese residents has risen steadily. In 2008, the gross national income per capita per<lb/> atlas method amounted to USD 2 770 (global country ranking 130 out of 210 countries) and<lb/> accordingly purchasing power parity amounted to USD 6 020 (global country ranking 122 out of<lb/> 210 countries) (World Bank, 2009d).<lb/> At the end of 2008, China&apos;s national employment amounted to 774.80 million people, of which<lb/> 39.01% lived in urban areas. A total of 40.07 million people in rural areas lived below the poverty<lb/> level, 23 defined as CNY 1 196 24 (approximately USD 75) per capita per annum (National Bureau of<lb/> Statistics of China, 2009).<lb/> Electricity generation and consumption<lb/> In 2008, total electricity production amounted to 3.45 trillion kWh, an increase of 5.6% compared to<lb/> 2007. Thermal power accounted for 81.2% of total production, with hydropower accounting for<lb/> 16.5% and nuclear energy for 2%. Forecasts for 2009 suggest that total power consumption will<lb/> increase by 3.5%, to 3.56 trillion kWh. According to estimates by the Power Economic Research<lb/> Institute of the State Grid Corporation, national consumption of electricity is expected to reach<lb/> approximately 3.94 trillion kWh by 2015 and approximately 7.425 trillion kWh by 2020 (State Grid<lb/> Corp. Power Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009).<lb/></table>

In 2008, total consumption amounted to 2.74 bn tonnes (a 3%<lb/> increase compared to 2007) of which approximately 40 Mt of coal had been imported. In the first<lb/> half of 2009, approximately 48.2 Mt were imported, an increase of 126.3 % (State Grid Corp. Power<lb/> Economic Research Institute, Jiang Liping, 2009). Total consumption of oil in 2008, mainly used in<lb/> the transport sector, amounted to 360 Mt with domestic production accounting for roughly half.<lb/> China, after the United States and Japan, is the third-largest oil importer in the world. Recent<lb/> estimates by the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of China suggest that by 2020, the oil consumption<lb/> may reach 620 Mt, of which approximately 60% will have to be imported. Although its share in total<lb/> energy consumption has increased over the years, natural gas only represented 3.63% of total<lb/> energy consumption in 2008.

			<head>Institutions involved in the power sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past 50 years, China&apos;s power management system has been in the process of continual<lb/> adjustment and changes. Before 1985, China centralised planning and management of the power<lb/> industry system, whereby the only decision-making body was the central government which was<lb/> directly responsible for production and allocation of resources. The system was managed through a<lb/> combination of central government and enterprises, and all investment and operation funds were<lb/> allocated by the State, while all the revenues were allocated to the Treasury. In 1985, the State<lb/> Council approved the &quot; Provisional Regulation on Encouragement of Fund-raising for Power Plants<lb/> and Implementation of Varied Prices &quot; , with the introduction of a new principle whereby the<lb/> enterprise now runs the power plant and the State manages the grid. Provinces were then also<lb/> allowed to manage power. The central government therefore gradually relaxed the regulation and<lb/> control on market access and pricing of the power industry, and at the same time delegated part of<lb/> the authority to local governments. Since then, the Chinese electricity market has shifted from<lb/> central planning to more private investment, competition and less regulation. Relevant policies are<lb/> therefore frequently adjusted and it is difficult to predict how far this liberalisation process will go<lb/> in the future.<lb/></p>

			<p>Today, authority over the energy sector at the national level is distributed over a dozen of<lb/> governmental agencies of which the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) plays<lb/> the most important role. Such a wide distribution of responsibilities has impaired co-ordination,<lb/> formulation, implementation and enforcement of energy policies. In its latest attempt to create an<lb/> effective national energy institution, the government established the National Energy Commission<lb/> (NEC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) in March 2008. The latter has a broad<lb/> mandate, which includes drafting energy plans and policies, negotiating with international energy<lb/> agencies, and approving foreign energy investments. A more detailed overview of NEA&apos;s individual<lb/> departments is shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite being a formal establishment, the NEA lacks the authority to set energy prices, which has<lb/> remained with the NDRC. Although, the NEA submits suggestions concerning energy price<lb/> adjustments to the NDRC, it is the latter and ultimately the State Council whose approval is required<lb/> for any major energy price change. In China, the responsibility for electricity pricing rests with the<lb/> State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), an independent regulator established under the<lb/> State Council in 2003. The SERC performs administrative and regulatory duties with regard to the<lb/> national electric power sector in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations.<lb/></p>

			<head>China&apos;s grid system<lb/></head>

			<p>China&apos;s national grid is divided into the &quot; State Grid Corporation of China &quot; (SGCC) (comprising of five<lb/> sub-grids in the north, connected to a sixth &quot; Central Grid &quot; , together supplying a population of<lb/> approximately 1.1 bn people) and the &quot; China Southern Power Grid &quot; (CSPG) (south China, supplying<lb/> a population of 230 million) as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>. In this respect, distributed power<lb/> generation through stand-alone systems is becoming increasingly confined to areas with very low<lb/> population density and to remote regions of the vast west of the country.<lb/></p>

Related responsibilities<lb/> may differ regionally and are usually difficult to locate in the relatively complex administrative system.<lb/></table>

			<p>In 1996, with the introduction of the Electric Power Law, the State began to implement preferential<lb/> policies for rural electrification, giving major support for ethnic minority settlements, remote areas and<lb/> poverty stricken areas. Moreover, the central government promoted the development of water<lb/> resources in rural areas, building small and medium-sized hydropower stations to boost rural<lb/> electrification. The State encouraged and supported the use of solar energy, wind energy, geothermal<lb/> energy, biomass and other energy sources so as to increase the power supply in rural areas. In 1999, the<lb/> State Council approved the &quot; Notification on Accelerating the Reform of Rural Power Systems and<lb/> Enhancing Rural Power Management &quot; (the State Council Doc. No. 2 1999), which carried out a<lb/> comprehensive structural reform of the management of rural electrification which affected rural power<lb/> marketing, rural power prices, power grids, investment and management. The reform introduced,<lb/> among other things, a practice whereby rural and urban residents in one province would pay the same<lb/> price for electricity.</p>

			<table>In 2002, the State Council&apos;s &quot; Circular on Program of Power System Reform &quot; (the<lb/> State Council Doc. No.5 2002) introduced the practice of &quot; Separation of Power Plants from Grid, and<lb/> Bidding for Generation &quot; , and the State Power Corporation was split into the two power grid companies<lb/> and five power generation groups. In 2007, the General Office of the State Council issued &quot; Views on the<lb/> Implementation of Deepening the Reform on Power System during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period &quot;<lb/> (The General Office of the State Council Doc. No.19 2007), which standardised the restructuring of<lb/> power enterprises at the county level, and encouraged the involvement of independent power<lb/> companies. Since 2007, the State encourages all types of investors to invest in rural power grids.<lb/> Table 7: Un-electrified households and populations (early 2006)<lb/> No Province<lb/> Households<lb/> Population<lb/> No<lb/> Province<lb/> Households<lb/> Population<lb/> 1<lb/> Yunnan<lb/> 503003<lb/> 2189361<lb/> 18<lb/> Shanxi<lb/> 12744<lb/> 50976<lb/> 2<lb/> Sichuan<lb/> 476707<lb/> 1939150<lb/> 19<lb/> Ningxia<lb/> 12664<lb/> 49650<lb/> 3<lb/> Tibet<lb/> 212431<lb/> 1200668<lb/> 20_1<lb/> Liaoning<lb/> 10854<lb/> 33403<lb/> 4<lb/> Inner Mongolia<lb/> 186658<lb/> 746632<lb/> 20_2<lb/> Dalian City<lb/> 9821<lb/> 44670<lb/> 5<lb/> Guangxi<lb/> 163302<lb/> 727892<lb/> 21<lb/> Fujian<lb/> 4797<lb/> 20901<lb/> 6<lb/> Chongqing<lb/> 153699<lb/> 552297<lb/> 22<lb/> Hebei<lb/> 2800<lb/> 11909<lb/> 7<lb/> Gansu<lb/> 123936<lb/> 523394<lb/> 23<lb/> Hunan<lb/> 31074<lb/> 124595<lb/> 8<lb/> Henan<lb/> 134472<lb/> 505372<lb/> 24<lb/> Hainan<lb/> 8700<lb/> 35000<lb/> 9<lb/> Qinghai<lb/> 89488<lb/> 495372<lb/> 25<lb/> Jiangsu<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>10<lb/> Shaanxi<lb/> 126838<lb/> 477831<lb/> 26<lb/> Anhui<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>11<lb/> Guizhou<lb/> 111830<lb/> 466350<lb/> 27<lb/> Beijing<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>12<lb/> Xinjiang<lb/> 95300<lb/> 415700<lb/> 28<lb/> Shanghai<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>13<lb/> Hubei<lb/> 72947<lb/> 243482<lb/> 29<lb/> Tianjin<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>14<lb/> Guangdong<lb/> 47938<lb/> 238417<lb/> 30<lb/> Jilin<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>15<lb/> Jiangxi<lb/> 45854<lb/> 191434<lb/> 31<lb/> Zhejiang<lb/> --<lb/>--<lb/>17<lb/> Xinjiang Military<lb/> 23234<lb/> 78106<lb/> 33<lb/> Total<lb/> 2695681<lb/> 11467438<lb/> Source: EU-China (2009).<lb/> Comparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies – © OECD/IEA 2010<lb/> Page | 42<lb/> As a consequence of China&apos;s efforts, the national electrification rate in 2009 was 99.4%, with rural areas<lb/> reaching 99% and urban areas 100% (IEA, 2009b). In 2006, a total of 11.5 million people were still lacking<lb/> electricity access (see Table 7), with wide variations among provinces. In late-2007, 11.5 million people<lb/> had still no access to electricity (March 2008, China Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development<lb/> Plan by 2020, NDRC). Latest statistics from the National Energy Administration suggest that in 2008,<lb/> 2 million rural households still lacked electricity in China, which represents some 9 to10 million people<lb/> (Tang<ref type="biblio">, 2009</ref>). Through the deployment of decentralised power systems, the government aims to supply<lb/> 10 million people with electricity by the end of 2020. The government however expects that beyond<lb/> 2020 some Chinese households will still be lacking electricity.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Institutional structure for rural electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>The institutional structure responsible for the Chinese electrification process underwent numerous<lb/> changes in the course of the last 50 years. Today, along with the realignment of formerly vertical<lb/> planning structures of the 1990s, rural electrification programmes and projects are hosted by<lb/> numerous entities, divided horizontally by administrative levels and vertically by topic.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1 Institutional structure – implementing agencies<lb/></head>

			<p>At present, five major government institutions have different functions and responsibilities in the field of<lb/> rural electrification. In addition to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), the State Grid<lb/> Corporation of China (SGCC), the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)<lb/> and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) are all considered to be influential in the<lb/> field of rural electrification. In general, the NDRC approves the rural electrification programmes<lb/> proposed by the National Energy Administration (NEA). The department for new and renewable energy<lb/> of the NEA deals with the bulk of planning related to rural electrification. Recently, the NDRC released<lb/> two guiding documents concerning rural electrification:</p>

			<table>China&apos;s Renewable Energy Development Plan<lb/> (2006-2010) released in March 2008, and China&apos;s Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development<lb/> Plan until 2020, released in September 2007.<lb/></table>

			<p>Regarding the actual electrification efforts, implementing actors differ according to whether<lb/> electrification is undertaken through grid extension or through decentralised systems.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of decentralised electrification, actual implementation is being done through<lb/> competitive bidding procedures such as in the Township Programme or occasionally through single<lb/> source selection. Implementation agencies can be formerly government-owned companies, start-up<lb/> companies that were formerly government-owned enterprises, or private companies. In general,<lb/> ownership is very challenging to determine, as China is moving from 100% government-owned<lb/> enterprises to private ownership, and the various forms of ownership are often not entirely<lb/> transparent. In the case of rural electrification through grid extension, the State Grid Corporation of<lb/> China and the Chinese Southern Power Grid proceed to the actual implementation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of electrification through grid extension, implementation is undertaken by the grids themselves.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.2 Institutional structure – funding<lb/></head>

			<p>According to the regulation contained in &quot; Views on Accelerating the Reform of the Rural Power<lb/> System and Enhancing the Rural Power Management &quot; , the central government has primarily<lb/> Page | 43<lb/> increased investment for rural power grid construction and transformation through loans from the<lb/> Agricultural Bank of China. Apart from these loans, power companies are encouraged by the central<lb/> government to seek funding for their activities through normal loan procedures. Local governments<lb/> at all administrative levels are also required to increase their support for rural power grid<lb/> construction, and provincial power corporations can borrow funds from them as well. Nowadays<lb/> there is a wide variety of financing sources – government and private – available, through grants,<lb/> loans, direct investment and in-kind contributions (<ref type="biblio">Yao &amp; Barnes, 2007</ref>). Government subsidies are<lb/> usually linked to development programmes that include the promotion of new technologies<lb/> (e.g. photovoltaic systems, small-scale wind turbines, biogas applications), electrification of areas<lb/> with unfavourable conditions or social measures such as poverty alleviation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 1987, a special interest-bearing loan for rural energy was created by the government. This loan<lb/> mainly supported large-scale biogas projects, solar thermal, and small-scale wind power<lb/> technologies. By 1996, the loan amounted to approximately CNY 0.12 bn (USD 17 million). The<lb/> interest on the enterprises&apos; loan was subsidised 50% by the commercial bank. This special loan<lb/> supported the promotion of the small-scale wind turbine industry and off-grid wind power. But<lb/> today, centrally planned rural electrification programmes using decentralised renewable energy<lb/> applications are entirely financed either by the central government or through a cost-sharing<lb/> scheme which features a financial contribution by the respective provincial government. The<lb/> &quot; Township Electrification Programme &quot; , which financially supported the construction of off-grid<lb/> renewable energy systems (hydropower, photovoltaic systems, wind) in eleven provinces over<lb/> 2002-2005, featured a joint financing scheme. The level of social and economic development in<lb/> each of the eleven provinces determined the level of funding granted by the central government. In<lb/> Tibet, for example, the central government covered 100% of the cost incurred by electrification<lb/> efforts, whereas in Qinghai only 80% and in Sichuan only 50% of the costs were covered. Therefore,<lb/> financing commitment for renewable energies is ensured by the government. In addition, the<lb/> government will formulate and implement rural renewable energy tax policies and regulations that<lb/> encourage public and private investment in renewable energy service companies (RESCOs) and that<lb/> ensure extensive renewable energy applications in the vast rural areas of China. China will also<lb/> provide tax incentives on renewable energy technology development and utilisation, on technical<lb/> research and development and on equipment manufacturing (NDRC, 2008).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.3 Institutional structure – recovery process<lb/></head>

			<p>At present, China&apos;s rural power management system follows the principle of &quot; one county 26 one<lb/> power supply enterprise &quot; , ensuring the integrated power management at all administrative levels<lb/> within a county. Therefore, all dwellers in a county are supposed to pay the same price for<lb/> electricity. Power supply enterprises charge fees according to the household consumption recorded<lb/> by metering at the national ratified electricity price. Electricity metering devices are certified by the<lb/> government. Both are measures to unify and standardise the electricity management and supply<lb/> structures (metering, billing, price) and at the same time to improve the quality of the service<lb/> (reliability, electrical stability).<lb/> Page | 44<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Description of current electrification programmes and<lb/> objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>In China, the traditional approach to providing electricity to rural areas is mainly through grid<lb/> extension. However, the long transmission lines often result in a small load and huge line losses. At<lb/> present, most regions without electricity are located in western regions and islands in the eastern<lb/> coastal areas, far away from the grid. Most of these areas are rich in renewable energy resources<lb/> (hydropower, solar and wind energy) which can practically and economically provide electrification<lb/> to remote regions. In rural China, electricity is supplied through three channels: a county is<lb/> connected to a national grid, or is supplied through local dispatch, or is self-supplied. Following this<lb/> pattern, China implemented the &quot; Brightness Programme &quot; and the &quot; County Hydropower<lb/> Construction of National Rural Electrification &quot; , using small hydropower, wind and solar power<lb/> generation for the electrification of rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.1 Historical rural electrification and expected end-use<lb/></head>

			<p>Development of China&apos;s rural electrification can be divided into three main stages (<ref type="biblio">Peng &amp; Pan,<lb/> 2006</ref>). During the first stage (1949-1977), rural communities were the main investors in rural<lb/> electrification efforts; during the second stage (<ref type="biblio">1978-1997</ref>) the central, provincial and local<lb/> governments all played fundamental roles; and during the third stage (since 1998) the central<lb/> government is the main investor. In 1997 the government noted that rural electricity supply<lb/> suffered from a number of problems. First of all, the rural grid was old, leading to unreliable and<lb/> unsafe electricity supply. Often the grid had been badly planned and built, leading to poor<lb/> electricity quality and supply disruptions. Large wire losses were pushing electricity tariffs to<lb/> extremes (<ref type="biblio">Peng &amp; Pan, 2006</ref>). As a consequence, in 1988 the government launched a major reform<lb/> of the rural power management system, transformed and renovated the rural grids with a view to<lb/> unifying electricity prices for urban and rural dwellers within a same grid. Seven years of grid<lb/> reconstruction and transformation have cost USD 49.5 billion to the Chinese government. 27 The<lb/> provincial grid companies managed and operated the renovation of the rural grids, while the costs<lb/> of network improvement were amortised through the national electricity tariff. Thanks to these<lb/> efforts, the structure of rural power grids were improved and safe operation enhanced the<lb/> reliability (to 99.7%) and the quality of power supply. Moreover, losses due to transmission of high-<lb/>voltage grids dropped to 10%, while losses in low-voltage grids dropped by 30% to 45% compared<lb/> to 12% before the grid improvement. 28 This significantly reduced electricity prices in rural areas and<lb/> facilitated the levelling of electricity prices, leading to strong growth in the demand for electricity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the last ten years, rural electrification has slowed down as a result of nearly universal<lb/> electrification (around 99%). At present, the emphasis is on modernisation, service and quality<lb/> improvements, poverty alleviation and introduction of new technologies (<ref type="biblio">Yao &amp; Barnes, 2007</ref>) and<lb/> innovative solutions for the remaining non-electrified remote areas in the vast western regions of<lb/> China. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>			<figure>illustrates the characteristics of the five main periods of Chinese rural electrification.<lb/> 27 Data provided by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Protection (IEEP), and the Chinese Academy of<lb/> Agricultural Engineering (CAEE) for this Information Paper.<lb/> 28 Data provided by the IEEP.<lb/></figure>

			<head>2.3.2 China&apos;s current rural electrification programmes and<lb/> achievements<lb/> Brightness Programme and Township Electrification Programme<lb/></head>

			<p>In 1996, the then State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) (called National Development<lb/> and Reform Commission, NDRC, since 1996) launched the so-called &quot; Brightness Programme &quot; the<lb/> aim of which was to supply approximately 23 million people living in remote rural areas with<lb/> electricity services by means of decentralised energy systems based on renewable energy resources<lb/> such as hydropower, solar and wind by 2010. The goal was to provide 100 watts of capacity per<lb/> person. During a pilot phase</p>

			<table>(1999-2002) in Inner Mongolia, 5 500 hybrid PV/wind/battery<lb/> household systems; in Gansu 10 000 solar home systems (SHS); in Tibet 30 PV/battery village power<lb/> systems and 11 000 SHS were installed. According to estimations, approximately 50 000 persons<lb/> had been supplied with electricity. As part of the Brightness Programme, the so-called &quot; Township<lb/> Electrification Programme &quot; (2002-2005), with a total investment of CNY 4.7 bn (USD 0.69 bn)<lb/> consisting of special central and local government funds, was used to supply electricity to 989 rural<lb/> townships and villages throughout western China.

			<head>County Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>The &quot; County Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification &quot; programme of the Ministry<lb/> of Water Resources seeks to build a total of 400 high-standard rural hydropower electrification<lb/> systems in 400 counties, thereby providing electricity to 880 000 people without electricity and to<lb/> 4.85 million people with insufficient electricity provision by 2010. Moreover, water authorities are<lb/> responsible for building small hydropower stations to replace conventional energy sources for<lb/> cooking and heating, supplying 1.7 million rural households (around 6.77million people). The goal is<lb/> to ensure electricity access to at least 99.9% of China (<ref type="biblio">Chen Lei, 2009</ref>).<lb/> By the end of 2008, 45 000 small hydropower stations were installed with a combined capacity of<lb/> 51 GW, supplying electricity to 300 million people living in rural areas with hydropower sources. 31 In<lb/> this context, the electrification rate in rural hydropower areas increased from 40% in 1980 to<lb/> 99.96% in 2008. In the course of the 10 th Five-Year Plan the central government spent CNY 115.5 bn<lb/> (USD 16.94 bn) to support the construction of 410 small hydropower stations with a total capacity<lb/> of 10.6 GW, or 30 MW per county (<ref type="biblio">Chen Lei, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

As can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>, at the end of 2007, out of a total of<lb/> 498 235 administrative villages within the State Grid Corporation of China, only 1 694 administrative<lb/> villages were still without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.66%. Moreover, out of a total of<lb/> 192 308 000 rural households within the State Grid Corporation&apos;s area, 250 000 households were<lb/> without electricity, an electrification rate of 99.87% of households.

			<head>2.3.4 Means of electrification<lb/> Preference for resource-relevant technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>Grid extension has always been the favoured option when it came to China&apos;s rural electrification.<lb/> Where decentralised solutions existed, they were usually considered as preliminary electrification<lb/> measures. From the point of view of end-users living in rural areas, electricity generated from<lb/> decentralised renewable energy systems was perceived as &quot; inferior &quot; and &quot; not always available &quot; and<lb/> therefore not the most favoured option. But recently, renewable energy technologies, both grid-<lb/>connected and stand-alone, were perceived as viable options for electricity production. This change<lb/> in perception is true for both the Chinese government and the Chinese population.<lb/> Today, the increasing difficulties to bring electricity to the remaining villages in the far west of the<lb/> country by grid extension, has led to questioning whether &quot; full grid coverage &quot; is economically<lb/> justified compared to using cheaper decentralised off-grid options. Because the last 11.5 million un-<lb/>electrified people are difficult to reach through grid extension, the government now aims to supply<lb/> electricity to 10 million people by the end of 2020 through the deployment of decentralised power<lb/> systems (China&apos;s Mid and Long-Term Renewable Energy Development Plan until 2020 released by<lb/> NDRC in <ref type="biblio">March 2008</ref>). Providing electricity to populations in remote, off-grid areas is a clear<lb/> objective of the ongoing 11 th Five-year Renewable Energy Plan, primarily featuring the deployment<lb/> of clean and renewable energy in the following order of priority: small hydro, PV village systems,<lb/> PV/wind hybrid systems, small wind turbines, and solar home systems. In areas with strong<lb/> hydropower potential, small hydro projects will be developed as a priority, because of the lower<lb/> cost per kWh generated. In areas with no water resources, small solar PV stations, PV/wind hybrid<lb/> stations, small wind turbines, solar home systems will be installed to provide electricity to over<lb/> 1 million households by the end of 2010. Target areas are Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang,<lb/> Yunnan, Gansu, and others. Today, one-third of the total rural electricity consumption is supplied by<lb/> local small hydropower (<ref type="biblio">Chen Lei, 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Preference for locally made stand-alone technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>In the late 1990s some equipment like small wind turbines, PV, SHS, had to be imported, because in<lb/> most cases these projects were part of bi-and/or multi-lateral technical co-operation. However, in<lb/> the course of the Brightness Programme, and notably the Township Electrification Programme from<lb/> April to July 2002, five nationwide public tenders were conducted to select system integrators 32 to<lb/> design, procure and install systems. Almost all equipment was domestically manufactured. Even in<lb/> projects financially supported by the German Bank for Reconstruction (Kreditanstalt für<lb/> Wiederaufbau, KfW), the equipment was locally produced except for the PV modules and inverters.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3.5 Description of expected end-use of electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>In the framework of rural electrification through decentralised renewable energy systems, the<lb/> Chinese government considers supplying electricity only for lighting, TV and radio as means to<lb/> support both basic social and economic development goals. Productive use of electricity by<lb/> households, as in the case of the Township Electrification Programme, is prohibited because it is<lb/> rightly expected that electricity demand would soon exceed the capacity of the installed battery<lb/> system. Frequent replacements of battery banks would consequently cause higher costs for<lb/> operation and maintenance. In isolated cases, end-users have however purchased small processing<lb/> equipment such as flour-grinding machines, oil seed pressing equipment, or even welding machines<lb/> to generate additional income.<lb/></p>

			<p>The distribution of end-use appliances has considerably changed over time. <ref type="table">Table 14</ref> illustrates the<lb/> starkly different distribution of common household appliances between rural and urban households<lb/> and also reflects China&apos;s enormous economic development in the course of the last decades (<ref type="biblio">Pan et<lb/> al., 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

This is a huge advance in rural households&apos; quality of life (Tang, 2009).<lb/></table>

			<p>The government sees electrification in poverty-stricken rural areas through small hydropower as a<lb/> means to improve production, promote economic and social development, and increase the income<lb/> of rural dwellers through employment opportunities provided by growing industries (<ref type="biblio">Chen Lei,<lb/> 2009</ref>). Electricity generated through hydropower systems is therefore expected to raise rural<lb/> incomes and facilitate the social and economic development in rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs<lb/> 2.4.1 Costs<lb/> Rural grids<lb/></head>

			<table>Since 1998, China has invested more than CNY 400 bn (USD 58.68 bn) in construction of power<lb/> plants in rural areas (Tang, 2009) of which USD 49.5 billion over the past seven years. 33 By the end<lb/> of 2005, the State Grid Corporation had invested over USD 27.89 billion in two phases of rural<lb/> power grid renovation (State Grid Corporation of China, 2009); USD 5.98 billion was invested in the<lb/> renovation of county power grids and USD 50.81 million in the renovation of the western power<lb/> grid; 20 % of these investments came from Treasury Bonds as capital, the remaining 80% from bank<lb/> loans. After the renovation of the rural grids, the depreciation cost and financial cost of the State<lb/> Grid Corporation have increased substantially. According to the &quot;Rural Grid Programme for the<lb/> Eleventh Five-Year Period by the State Grid Corporation&quot;, during the period covered by the plan, the<lb/> estimated investment in rural grids by the Corporation will be USD 16.57 billion, of which<lb/> USD 3.31 billion of capital, and USD 13.26 billion of bank loans. The average annual investment will<lb/> be USD 3.26 billion, of which USD 0.65 billion of capital, and USD 2.61 billion of bank loans. 34<lb/> Page | 53<lb/> Brightness Programme/Township Programme<lb/> The national &quot; Township Programme &quot; , authorised by the State Council in 2001, was initiated in mid-<lb/>2002 with the goal to supply electricity to the remaining 1 065 administrative townships 35 in rural<lb/> western China. The programme has cost CNY 4.97 bn (USD 730 million) of which CNY 2 bn<lb/> (USD 293 million) came from the central government and the rest from provincial and township<lb/> governments. Through a competitive bidding procedure at the provincial level, the so-called system<lb/> integrators responsible for the installation, operation and maintenance for three years were<lb/> selected. Most systems were installed during the mid-2002 to 2004 period. In total, 989 power<lb/> stations were constructed of which 721 are PV and PV/wind hybrid systems with a total capacity of<lb/> 15.53 MW and 146 small hydropower stations with a total capacity of 113 MW.<lb/></table>

			<p>The subsidy needed to facilitate the operation of decentralised renewable energy systems, mainly<lb/> photovoltaic, amounted to a total of approximately CNY 20 million (USD 2.93 million), the average<lb/> subsidy being about CNY 2 900/kW of installed capacity in one year.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4.2 Framework conditions and business incentives<lb/></head>

			<p>Historically, rural electrification through grid extension or decentralised renewable energy<lb/> applications in order to achieve nationwide electrification is the mandate of the government. This<lb/> mandate is reflected in previous and future Five-Year National Development Plans that outline<lb/> relevant rural electrification undertakings with their corresponding budget.<lb/></p>

			<p>In late 2002, worldwide experience with PV and PV/wind hybrid systems in villages − seen from<lb/> institutional, social, economical, environmental and technical angles − was extremely limited. This<lb/> explains why the private sector did not engage in the implementation of the Township Electrification<lb/> Programme. The main actors remained government-affiliated institutions or semi-private entities such<lb/> as spin-off companies from former government institutions previously involved in rural electrification<lb/> projects and that had already gained experience. In this context, because certain criteria had to be<lb/> fulfilled to be selected as participant in the competitive bidding procedure, companies with a track<lb/> record were in an advantageous position compared to &quot; potential newcomers in the business &quot; .<lb/> Moreover, when selecting the so-called &quot; system integrators &quot; , these were considered responsible for the<lb/> construction, maintenance and operation of these decentralised village power systems for three years,<lb/> and contracts stipulating tasks, responsibilities and modes of payment were signed. Since all constructed<lb/> systems were off-grid, no public-private partnerships had to be arranged. As of today, although the<lb/> contracts came to an end, some system integrators still operate, maintain and organise the supply of<lb/> spare parts, and train local technicians for these off-grid systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed<lb/></head>

			<p>China is currently facing challenges in its objective of 100% rural electrification.<lb/></p>

			<head>Theft and vandalism<lb/></head>

			<p>China has no official statistics regarding electricity losses due to theft or vandalism whether for rural<lb/> grids or stand-alone systems. However, theft and vandalism do occur and are perceived as<lb/> problems which require an urgent solution. In the absence of effective supervising mechanisms,<lb/> damage and theft of equipment have become a serious concern in that they affect the operation of<lb/> power plants. There is a widely shared view that measures need to be taken during the system<lb/> construction itself. In the case of the Township Electrification Programme, in late 2006 stolen PV<lb/> modules were reported to the responsible Provincial Department of Reform and Development<lb/> Commission with a view to obtain funding for replacements. In some cases, PV modules have been<lb/> welded to the basic structure so as to create additional hindrances for potential thieves. By<lb/> comparison, privately owned local systems are under better control, especially solar home systems,<lb/> small-scale wind turbines and pico-hydropower stations, and are therefore less subject to theft and<lb/> vandalism.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prohibitive operational costs<lb/></head>

			<p>For decades, China&apos;s focus has been on securing power supply for urban and industrial use. As a<lb/> consequence, the gap in service supply between urban and rural areas has been growing. Rural<lb/> areas remained relatively under-developed, and growth in electricity use was slow, seasonal and<lb/> fluctuating over the day. Long transmission lines, coupled with low load density, have resulted in<lb/> high costs for rural power supply and little or no business revenues. Moreover, because of past<lb/> management practices of some county power suppliers, these were heavily indebted and the<lb/> majority of their workers were unskilled. These prohibitive operational costs have discouraged<lb/> potential investors. Centralised structures, rooted in history and politics, were preferred, resulting<lb/> in grid extensions to areas with high construction costs, transmission losses and maintenance<lb/> expenses, instead of opting for decentralised solutions.<lb/> However, with its goal to electrify an extra 10 million people by 2020 through the use of locally<lb/> available renewable energy resources, and the sharp fall of application costs for renewable energy<lb/> systems during the last decade, China is striving to become the world market leader for PV and<lb/> wind energy technology. The lower costs incurred by growing domestic demand will be a strong<lb/> economic incentive for greater industry involvement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Low quality of rural electricians<lb/></head>

			<p>Before the reconstruction of rural grids, the low level of electrification in rural areas required work<lb/> from only ordinary unskilled electricians. These were usually farmers whose main income came<lb/> from agriculture, but who worked part-time for electricity companies, even collecting the bills as<lb/> part of their tasks. However, with electrification spreading to rural areas, the technological<lb/> complexity of electricians&apos; work increased. The need for constantly improving electricity services<lb/> has expanded the rural electricity market. Rural electricians are now required to work full-time<lb/> while upgrading their skills. With relatively low wages and an often insecure revenue flow, no<lb/> medical insurance and no pensions, skilled electricians are difficult to find and very few residents in<lb/> economically developed villages want to become electricians. There is no suitable training available,<lb/> and most of the new local technicians/operators have not received any technical training and<lb/> therefore are unable to perform operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) tasks. The government is<lb/> therefore in the process of identifying mechanisms and institutions, preferably at provincial level, to<lb/> ensure that potential candidates benefit from a standardised training in operation and maintenance<lb/> tasks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Operation and maintenance reliability for off-grid<lb/></head>

			<p>Commercialisation by private-sector companies bears the risk that after-sale support is neglected<lb/> owing to low profitability. Moreover, with the rapid implementation of the programme, insufficient<lb/> consideration was given to user training, and only a minimum budget allocation for training<lb/> purposes was earmarked in the original budget. The most common perception in the past was that<lb/> &quot; electricity is a hands-on business &quot; where no special qualification was required. Today, with<lb/> increasing technical complexity, it is essential to train members of the villages/townships. However,<lb/> here again, the lower level of education among the rural population makes it difficult to recruit<lb/> people with a basic knowledge of mechanical or electrical engineering, who would be ready to<lb/> follow the training courses provided by system integrators, project owners or the like. In general,<lb/> once off-grid applications have been installed, at least two inhabitants of these villages/townships<lb/> will be appointed by the village/township government to serve as rural technicians and to perform<lb/> basic operation and maintenance tasks such as cleaning PV modules, checking batteries, collecting<lb/> electricity fees, replacing fuses, fixing disconnected wires, and so on.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>China has made major efforts to restructure its energy system and provide electricity to its remote<lb/> areas. It has succeeded in tackling the problems of electrification by using different renewable<lb/> energy power systems, and abandoning grid extension efforts when these were not economical or<lb/> practical. During the electrification process, China has faced numerous challenges some of which<lb/> remain to be addressed. However, rural electrification in China is no doubt a success story that has<lb/> led to near-complete electrification of the most populated country of the world in a relatively short<lb/> period. Since this process started several decades ago, a distinction should be made between the<lb/> older and recent processes.<lb/></p>

			<head>Keys to historical rural electrification success<lb/></head>

			<p>Pragmatism overcame ideology, in the sense that although the central government had absolute<lb/> power and clear plans on how to electrify the country, it yielded administrative responsibility to<lb/> local levels in support of a different approach, more efficient and appropriate to the situation. The<lb/> price that had to be paid for the rapid initial electrification included inconsistent tariff structures,<lb/> administrative responsibility overlaps, low technical quality of installations and often small electrical<lb/> capacities that were suitable only for a limited range of applications.<lb/></p>

			<head>Keys to recent rural electrification success<lb/></head>

			<p>The recent and ongoing rural electrification activities are characterised by technically advanced<lb/> programmes to supply electricity to areas with difficult conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Government commitment: Whether through grid extension or decentralised off-grid applications,<lb/> universal supply of electricity has been one of the government&apos;s objectives. As a socialist country,<lb/> China aims to give all its citizens the same basic living conditions, including access to electricity. As<lb/> with other rural electrification programmes, the government&apos;s commitment (through efficient<lb/> planning and sufficient long-term funding) has proven most fundamental to the electrification<lb/> success.<lb/></p>

			<p>Technological flexibility: The &quot; last remaining un-electrified areas &quot; means areas that are &quot; hardest to<lb/> electrify &quot; , with the highest costs if inappropriate means are chosen. This situation was avoided by<lb/> choosing a wide array of technologies to prove their respective competitive advantages. The<lb/> Township Programme was among the first to use technologies such as PV hybrid systems on a large<lb/> scale. Moreover, the use of small hydropower plants in water-rich areas, as in the &quot;</p>

			<table>County<lb/> Hydropower Construction of National Rural Electrification &quot; , has brought resource-specific answers<lb/> to electrification concerns.<lb/> Sense of ownership: Areas with low population density require individual household systems where<lb/> operation, maintenance and ownership are in the same hands. In China, operation and<lb/> maintenance worked best if a strong sense of ownership was present as far as individual<lb/> applications like pico hydropower, solar home systems and small-scale wind generators were<lb/> concerned.<lb/> Private-sector implementation entities: The competitive bidding procedure of the Township<lb/> Programme sought to minimise implementation costs. However, not all participants to the bidding<lb/> process were equally capable of performing the tasks, since formerly government-owned<lb/> companies had a competitive advantage in that they had acquired experience in rural<lb/> electrification.<lb/></table>

			<head>Remaining challenges linked to grid extension<lb/></head>

			<p>Complex administrative structures: Even though rural electricity supply now lies in the hands of<lb/> large power companies after a reform to unify the electricity system, strong county-and township-<lb/>level government influence on the management of small hydropower still prevails. There is an<lb/> overlap of responsibilities between the central, provincial and county government players in the<lb/> management of rural electrification and it is not always clear who is ultimately responsible for the<lb/> operation and management of rural electrification structures. This problem still needs to be<lb/> addressed to improve the fluidity and long-term viability of the electrification process.<lb/></p>

			<head>Low</head>

			<table>level of rural power consumption: According to 2009 IEA calculations, China&apos;s total per-capita<lb/> electricity consumption had reached 2 328 kWh in 2007, a 14% increase since 2006. There remains<lb/> a strong urban-rural divide in electricity consumption. This shows that additional and significant<lb/> electrification efforts are needed and that economic development has not yet fully propelled rural<lb/> households to the levels of urban households.<lb/></table>

			<p>Pricing: The Chinese pricing policy remains unclear. There is no market pricing mechanism for<lb/> electricity since prices are still set by the government. Power suppliers are therefore not assured<lb/> the necessary profits. This particularly affects the long-term investment security for investors in<lb/> county-level power systems. Rural power grids are unattractive to investors owing to these market<lb/> uncertainties. The example of the Yunnan Province demonstrated that rural end-users limited their<lb/> monthly electricity consumption to a level that makes it completely unattractive to the electricity<lb/> company to invest further in infrastructure and maintenance.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lack of competition in the county:</head>

			<p>Supply companies targeting rural areas have always enjoyed a<lb/> monopolistic position. According to the Chinese &quot; one county one supplier &quot; policy, the supplier is to<lb/> provide the full range of services at a given price. Market access by other investors is difficult if not<lb/> impossible. This, along with rigid rules on production, supply and marketing of electricity, prevents<lb/> innovation, competition and reform.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prohibitive maintenance costs and lack of funding:</head>

			<p>Rural grids incur major construction and<lb/> maintenance costs. Although there are maintenance fees, they are insufficient to cover the<lb/> expenses of the ever-increasing assets. Two-thirds of the fees collected through rural electricity<lb/> tariffs are used for building electricity generators, and the remaining third is insufficient for<lb/> acquiring maintenance equipment for grid renovation or development (<ref type="biblio">Luo, 2007</ref>). These financial<lb/> burdens negatively impact business revenues. In addition, in the course of the energy sector reform<lb/> which began in 1998, some electricity facilities of the rural grids have been corroded, damaged, or<lb/> generally could not meet the demand, and thus needed either replacement or modification, again<lb/> incurring large expenses. The improvement of living standards and the economic development of<lb/> rural areas, a consequence of electrification, stimulate electricity demand, and put power supply<lb/></p>

			<table>companies under permanent financial strain. Rural grids need constant renovation and<lb/> maintenance.<lb/> Page | 57<lb/> Main remaining challenges linked to the Brightness Programme/Township Programme<lb/> Use of unsuitable material: As a first step towards the ambitious objectives of the Brightness<lb/> Programme, a three-year pilot phase was launched in 1999 in three provinces. A survey conducted<lb/> by the Institute of Electrical Engineering (JKD) in Inner Mongolia in late 2003 (Chinese Academy of<lb/> Science, 2003) revealed that out of 5 240 PV/wind/battery hybrid systems for which statistics were<lb/> available, a total of 2 119 systems (40.4%) were malfunctioning. Problems with the inverters/charge<lb/> controllers accounted for 1 099 sets (20.9%) followed by 657 problems with batteries (12.5%) and<lb/> 363 problems with wind turbines (6.9%). On-site investigations suggested that the bearings of wind<lb/> turbines were made out of unsuitable copper material. The main causes of the exceptionally high<lb/> proportion of malfunctioning charge controllers/inverters were poor technical design and the<lb/> utilisation of unsuitable material during assembly. Consequently, the malfunctioning charge<lb/> controller/inverter shortened the lifetime of 657 batteries. As a result, a general dissatisfaction<lb/> among end-users prevailed and led in many cases to the refusal to pay the final instalment for the<lb/> systems. Table 16 provides an overview of future costs to 2020. 36<lb/> Unclear long-term operation and maintenance: When the Township Electrification Programme was<lb/> designed, government financial support was almost entirely earmarked for the procurement of<lb/> hardware. Through a competitive bidding system, system integrators were selected and according<lb/> to what the bidding documents stipulated, their responsibility merely included the design,<lb/> construction, operation and maintenance of the off-grid systems. However, this lasted only three<lb/> years. Today, more than six years after the Township Electrification Programme was initiated, a<lb/> number of pressing issues are still pending here and there, e.g. ownership (transfer from national to<lb/> provincial/township government), management (financial and contractual requirements for<lb/> Renewable Energy Service Companies, RESCOs), financial support (governmental subsidies to cover<lb/> expenses incurred for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) during the 20 years of the system&apos;s life),<lb/> tariff setting (official guidelines to set a tariff to be paid by end-users and how the difference in<lb/> tariffs can be balanced through the provisions made in the Chinese Renewable Energy Law).<lb/> Moreover, ownership in most of the provinces has not been defined, so that many entities are<lb/> unwilling to take responsibility for operation and maintenance, causing problems in daily<lb/> management, bill collection, equipment replacements and repairs, etc. Different tariffs (there is no<lb/> single tariff for all townships), lead to insufficient revenues earmarked for O&amp;M. The collection of<lb/> one end-user tariff is not sufficient to cover all the costs incurred for O&amp;M, replacement of<lb/> components, repairs and the monthly salary of local technicians/operators. Thus, continued<lb/> financial support from the government is indispensable.<lb/> Long-term technical reliability: Many technologies used in the electrification programme have<lb/> never been applied on a large scale and some were even specifically developed for this programme.<lb/> This poses the question of long-term reliability of the technologies applied.<lb/> 36 In the course of the survey involving 11 out of 13 system integrators, budget estimates were compiled<lb/> covering the potential lifetime of village power PV systems over the 2006-2020 period. In total, four cost<lb/> categories have been identified.<lb/> -Operation &amp; maintenance of PV systems (primarily maintenance and monthly salary of on-site local<lb/> operator);<lb/> -Cost to cover the technical support rendered by Renewable Energy Service Companies&apos; routine<lb/> inspection, labour, problem-solving, communication, management, reasonable profit;<lb/> -Cost to cover the replacement of equipment (twice battery replacement, major repair, other<lb/> electronic devices such as inverter, controller, mini-grid);<lb/> -Other cost (training and unforeseen expenses).<lb/></table>

			<head>Unclear financial mechanisms: Besides unclear mechanisms</head>

			<p>regarding the awarding and control of<lb/> subsidies, there is no model to calculate the real cost of subsidies in support of energy generated<lb/> from renewable sources. Growing energy demand at the local level is straining the entire system,<lb/> notably batteries which often require fast replacement. But who is to pay? The most pressing<lb/> matter is to find sufficient funding to ensure a long-term sustainable operation until 2020. In the<lb/> meantime, to support the long-term financial viability of rural electrification efforts, the central<lb/> government is nevertheless allocating subsidies earmarked for a number of previously implemented<lb/> off-grid electrification programmes, as <ref type="table">Table 15</ref> shows.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, rural electrification efforts have slowed down during the last ten years as nationwide<lb/> electrification is nearly complete. China has achieved an electrification rate of 99.4%, with 99% in<lb/> rural areas and already 100% in urban settings, thanks to the government&apos;s aggressive measures<lb/> and strong political will. At present, the emphasis is shifting to modernisation, service and quality<lb/> improvements, poverty alleviation and the introduction of new energy technologies (<ref type="biblio">Yao &amp; Barnes,<lb/> 2007</ref>) and innovative solutions for the remote areas in the vast western regions of China that<lb/> remain without electricity. The Chinese government estimates that only 1.5 million people will still<lb/> be without in 2020.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 India<lb/></head>

			<p>With the largest rural population in the world, India is facing a huge electrification challenge. Today,<lb/> 64.5% of India is electrified, with an electrification rate of 93.1% in urban settings but only 52.5% in<lb/> rural areas (IEA, 2009b). This has been achieved mainly through grid extension or small-scale<lb/> renewable energy systems. Strong political will and sufficient funds have, since the beginning of the<lb/> 11 th Five-Year Plan, accelerated the speed of electrification. But India is currently faced with<lb/> insufficient electricity generating capacity, which is seriously hindering the implementation of<lb/> future rural electrification programmes and undermining their viability. India&apos;s energy sector,<lb/> electrification efforts and the remaining challenges are detailed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Introduction and country description<lb/></head>

			<p>The Republic of India is the seventh-largest country in the world with respect to its geographical<lb/> area, covering 3.29 million square km and including 7 517 km of coastline. Its terrain ranges from an<lb/> elevated tableland in the south, to deserts in the west, the Himalayas Mountains in the north, and<lb/> flat to rolling plains along the Ganges River.<lb/></p>

			<head>Political context<lb/></head>

			<p>India is a federal State divided into 28 states and 7 union territories. Since 1947, the year of its<lb/> independence, it is the world&apos;s largest democracy. An elected president is the Head of State.<lb/> Executive power resides with the Prime Minister, while legislative power resides with the Upper<lb/> House (Rajya Sabha) and the Lower House (Lok Sabha). The 28 states have their own elected<lb/> governments, and the 7 union territories are governed by an administrator appointed by central<lb/> government (except for the territories of Delhi and Pondicherry). A governor for each state is<lb/> nominated by the president. The Indian Constitution defines the legislative and administrative<lb/> relationships between the central and state governments but some issues such as electricity and<lb/> economic and social planning are the joint responsibility of both central and state governments.<lb/> Depending on the issue addressed, policies and laws are either set at the central or state level but<lb/> central law always prevails if state and central laws are conflicting (IEA, 2007).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the power sector, policy setting and implementation is divided between five ministries: the Ministry of<lb/> Power (MoP), the Ministry of Coal, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Ministry of New and<lb/> Renewable Energies (MNRE) and the Department of Atomic Energy, and government commissions and<lb/> agencies. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is a body under the MoP which co-ordinates energy<lb/> efficiency and energy conservation measures, and the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), under the MoP,<lb/> acts as an advisory body to the central government on matters of national electricity policy, and specifies<lb/> technical standards and norms for grid operation and maintenance among other issues. Under the MoP,<lb/> the</p>

			<table>Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) regulates central and interstate-level power-related<lb/> activities, while the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) work on state-level licensing, state-<lb/>level electricity tariffs and competitive issues. Among MNRE&apos;s main activities is the expansion of the use of<lb/> renewable energy technologies in remote rural areas. State governments also have considerable<lb/> responsibilities in the power sector as they are responsible for the implementation of national laws. They<lb/> can set their own laws and regulations to be applied on their territory. Because of this setting, the<lb/> implementation of power sector reforms differs in each state (IEA, 2007).<lb/> Economic data<lb/> India&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (in billion USD 2000) attained<lb/> USD 4 024 billion in 2009 (IEA, 2009e). In 2007, services accounted for 52.8% of total GDP, industry<lb/> for 29.4% and agriculture for 17.8% (World Bank, 2008). The large share of services in total GDP is<lb/> remarkably high compared to most other developing economies. Average annual growth of GDP<lb/> has also been high, averaging at 6.9% over the 1997-2007 period, reaching 9.7% in 2006 and 9% in<lb/> 2007. Over 2007-2011 the economy is expected to grow at an average of 8.5% (World Bank, 2008).<lb/> However, according to the World Bank, the 2008-2009 global financial crisis has caused India&apos;s<lb/> economic growth to weaken over that period compared to the previous three years. India&apos;s Ministry<lb/> of Finance expects the economy to grow by only 6.1% over 2008-2009 (Ministry of Finance, 2009).<lb/> Population and its economic profile<lb/> India is the second most populous country after China and the first most populous democracy with<lb/> a total population reaching an estimated 1 139 965 million in 2008, which is about 17% of the<lb/> world&apos;s population (World Bank, 2009d). According to the Central Intelligence Agency&apos;s World<lb/> Factbook for India, in 2003, 60% of the labour force worked in agriculture, 12% in industry and 28%<lb/> in services; the total unemployment rate across sectors in 2008 was 6.8% (CIA, 2009). India has the<lb/> largest rural population in the world with 828 million rural inhabitants. In 2008, 70.8% of India&apos;s<lb/> total population lived in rural areas, progressively migrating to urban areas at an annual rate of<lb/> 2.3%, a rate which is below that of many other countries (UNPD, 2008).<lb/></table>

While such economic development has led to an average increase in the standards of<lb/> living, it has left the agricultural sector untouched, bypassing most of the rural poor. Therefore,<lb/> although India has enjoyed a growth of GDP per capita, poverty remains a challenge. Poverty is also<lb/> more concentrated in some states such as the eastern and north-eastern states as Figure 7 shows.<lb/> India has over 300 million poor people living below the &quot; poverty line &quot; as defined by the Planning<lb/> Commission. In March 2007, the Indian Planning Commission estimated that over the 2004-2005<lb/> period, more than one-quarter of India&apos;s total population (27.5%) still lived below the poverty line<lb/> (BPL), with a distribution of 25.7% urban dwellers and 28.3% rural dwellers (Planning Commission,<lb/> Government of India, 2007) 37 as seen in Table 17.<lb/> Table 17: Number and percentage of people below the poverty line in India (1983-2004)<lb/> Years<lb/> Rural<lb/> Urban<lb/> Combined<lb/> in million<lb/> in percent<lb/> in million<lb/> in percent<lb/> in million<lb/> in percent<lb/> 1983<lb/> 252<lb/> 45.7<lb/> 70<lb/> 40.8<lb/> 322<lb/> 44.5<lb/> 1993<lb/> 244<lb/> 37.3<lb/> 76<lb/> 32.3<lb/> 320<lb/> 36<lb/> 2004<lb/> 220<lb/> 28.3<lb/> 80<lb/> 25.7<lb/> 301<lb/> 27.5<lb/> Source: Planning Commission -Government of India (2008).<lb/></table>

			<p>The government of India is hoping that rapid economic growth, coupled with access by all to the<lb/> basic amenities − electricity access, health, education and clean water − will be the keys to levelling<lb/> the income disparity among the rural and urban populations (<ref type="biblio">Planning Commission, 2006</ref>). But<lb/> strong economic growth alone does not bring such amenities to the rural poor. For this reason, the<lb/> Planning Commission has been working to establish solid infrastructures such as electricity<lb/> connections, telephone connections, roads, railways and irrigation so as to improve the productivity<lb/> of agricultural and rural industries (<ref type="biblio">Planning Commission, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Rural – urban divide: unequal access to electricity<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2005, a total of 412 million people in India had no access to electricity, with 380 million of them<lb/> (92% of total population) living in rural areas and 32 million in urban areas (IEA, 2007). According to<lb/> recent IEA estimates, India is today 64.5% electrified, with an urban electrification rate reaching<lb/> 93.1% and a rural rate of only 52.5% (IEA, 2009b).<lb/> 37 The definition of the poverty line is a major cause for international and internal debate. In India, its<lb/> definition has changed considerably over the years. Since 2006, the criterion used by the Planning<lb/> Commission is the monthly per capita consumption expenditure and is based on a caloric norm. Its definition<lb/> is used to identify individuals who are in need of government assistance and aid. The Planning Commission<lb/> considers that an individual is living below the poverty line if his or her monthly consumption expenditure is<lb/> below Indian rupees (INR) 356.35 in rural areas (around USD 7 or enough to purchase 2 400 calories of<lb/> nutrition) or below INR 538.60 in urban areas (around USD 10.5 or enough to purchase 2 100 calories of<lb/> nutrition</p>

			<table>). Under this criterion, 27.5% of the Indian population live below the poverty line. Because of major<lb/> debate over this definition, government committees have been asked to rethink the definition of the poverty<lb/> line. In 2007, the Arjun Sengupta Committee estimated that a total of 77% of the Indian population lived with<lb/> less than INR 20 (USD 0.4) a day, with 27.5% living under the poverty line, and some 50% living just slightly<lb/> above it. In June 2009, a committee chaired by the Supreme Court food commissioner N C Saxena, and<lb/> appointed by the Rural Development Ministry suggested a revision of the parameters defining a new poverty<lb/> line, under which 50% of the Indian population would live. Such numbers differ from International<lb/> estimations such as those of the Asian Development Bank estimating that 41.6% of the population live below<lb/> the poverty line of USD 1.25 (PPP) per day (Asian Development Bank, 2009).<lb/> Page | 64<lb/> Installed capacity<lb/> According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) of the Ministry of Power (MoP), on 31 July 2009, India&apos;s<lb/> total installed capacity had reached 151 073 megawatts (MW).

			<p>Electricity consumption per capita is among the lowest in the world, equalling 543 KWh/capita (IEA,<lb/> 2009e). Although India has considerably improved its generating capacity, it still has difficulty in<lb/> meeting demand and there are persistent power shortages which constrain India&apos;s economic<lb/> growth. With the development of the industrial and commercial sectors as well as the wider use of<lb/> electrical equipment, electricity demand keeps increasing. To meet this increasing demand, India<lb/> will have to make substantial investments in the electricity sector.

			<p>Before 2006, the Indian power system was composed of five regional grids operating<lb/> independently, namely the Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern, and North-Eastern Grids. Each<lb/> one covered several states. Since August 2006, all these regional grids except for the Southern Grid<lb/> have been integrated and now operate together at the same frequency. They are now treated as if<lb/> they were one single grid called the NEWNE grid. The southern grid is planned to be synchronously<lb/> operated with the NEWNE grid towards the beginning of the 12 th Five-Year Plan (Central Electricity<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Authority, 2008</ref>). Therefore, India still does not have a real unified grid and the intra-country<lb/> capacity needs to be strongly increased to meet the country&apos;s needs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Distribution and electricity losses<lb/></head>

			<p>Distribution is the weakest link of India&apos;s power supply chain as it faces substantial technical losses<lb/> (because of overloading of transformers and conductors, for instance) and commercial losses of<lb/> electricity (because of low metering efficiency, poor billing and collection, large-scale theft of<lb/> power) averaging 33.7% of total generation in 2006/07 with variations by state as illustrated in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. These losses are among the highest in the world. They compare to some countries in sub-<lb/>Saharan Africa. They compromise the financial viability of the power sector, and discourage<lb/> investment (IEA, 2007).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Description of current electrification programmes, targets<lb/> and achievements<lb/></head>

			<p>Until 1997, a village was considered electrified if electricity was being used within its revenue area<lb/> for any purpose whatsoever. In 1997 a new definition was adopted whereby &quot; A village will be<lb/> deemed to be electrified if electricity is used in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary<lb/> of the village for any purpose whatsoever &quot; . Under this definition, in March 2004 a total of 74% of<lb/> inhabited villages were considered electrified, whereas only 44% of the 138 million rural households<lb/> (60.2 million) used electricity as a source of lighting. However, according to this definition, if only<lb/> one light bulb was kept lit for a nightly hour in the centre of a village or one irrigation pump was<lb/> powered, the whole village was considered electrified. Realising this inadequacy and the statistical<lb/> bias that came with it, the government of India changed its definition for rural electrification in<lb/> March 2004. A village was considered electrified when the following criteria were satisfied:<lb/>  &quot; The basic infrastructure (such as distribution transformer and/or distribution lines) is<lb/> made available in the inhabited locality within the revenue boundary of the village,<lb/> including available power supply on demand at at least one hamlet/Dalit Basti as<lb/> applicable, and any of the public places like schools, Panchayat Office (village council),<lb/> health centres, dispensaries, community centres etc.; and<lb/>  The number of households electrified should be at least 10% of the total households in<lb/> the village. &quot;<lb/> Page | 67<lb/></p>

			<p>As a consequence of this new definition for electrification, many villages that were previously<lb/> considered electrified fell by definition into the un-electrified category.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1 The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) scheme<lb/> <ref type="table">Targets</ref>			<figure>of the RGGVY<lb/> In February 2005, a large-scale electrification effort, the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana<lb/> (RGGVY) scheme was launched by the MoP to speed up rural electrification under the &quot; Power for all<lb/> by 2012 &quot; initiative. The RGGVY is a major programme of grid extension and reinforcement of the<lb/> rural electricity infrastructure. &quot; By 2009/10 the RGGVY aims to electrify the 125 000 villages still<lb/> without electricity; to connect all the estimated 23.4 million un-electrified households below the<lb/> poverty line with a 90% subsidy on connecting costs granted by the Ministry of Power; and finally,<lb/> to augment the backbone network in all 462 000 electrified villages. The 54.6 million households<lb/> above the poverty line which are currently un-electrified are expected to obtain electricity<lb/> connection on their own without any subsidy&quot; (Planning Commission, 2005). 39 The RGVVY policy<lb/> therefore aims at:<lb/>  &quot; Provision of electricity access to all households (including rural households) by year<lb/> 2009 (which includes 23.4 million households living below the poverty line);<lb/>  Quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates; and<lb/>  Minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a merit good by year<lb/> 2012. &quot; (Ministry of Power, 2008)<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, the electrification programme as envisaged under RGGVY was too slow during the 10th<lb/> plan period. In January 2008, the RGGVY was further extended into the 11th plan period (2007-<lb/>2012) with the following new conditions for its better implementation:<lb/></p>

			<p> States are to ensure a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of power supply;<lb/>  States are to ensure quality and reliable power supply at reasonable rates;<lb/>  The deployment of franchisees is mandatory for the management of rural distribution;<lb/>  Introduction of the three-tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism to ensure quality of<lb/> materials and implementation; and<lb/>  States are to notify their rural electrification plans to the Rural Electrification<lb/> Corporation (REC) 40 within six months.<lb/></p>

			<head>Means of electrification in rural areas under the RGGVY<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RGGVY, projects would be financed for provision of the following systems:<lb/>  A Rural Electricity Distribution Backbone (REDB) with 33/11 kV (or 66/11 kV) sub-station<lb/> of adequate capacity in every block where none exists;<lb/>  Village Electrification Infrastructure (VEI) with provision of distribution transformer of<lb/> appropriate capacity in villages/habitations; and<lb/>  Decentralised Distributed Generation (DDG) systems based on conventional sources<lb/> where grid supply is not feasible or cost-effective.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the RGGVY scheme, the first approach to village electrification will be through grid extension. Where<lb/> grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective, then stand-alone systems are considered which<lb/> can be powered by renewable energy sources or conventional sources, namely through DDG systems. All<lb/> infrastructures must be grid-compatible in order to ensure that when a village is ultimately connected to<lb/> the grid, prior investments are not lost. In DDG projects of the RGGVY, the renewable energy technologies<lb/> currently used are diesel generating sets powered by biofuels (non-edible vegetable oils), diesel generating<lb/> sets powered by producer gas generated through biomass gasification, solar photovoltaic, and small<lb/> hydropower plants. Other technologies, such as diesel generating sets powered by biogas (from animal<lb/> waste), wind hybrid systems or other hybrid systems, including any &quot; new &quot; technology, are currently not yet<lb/> popularly used for DDG in India, but may be used in the future. Moreover, although diesel is the easiest<lb/> form of decentralised power generation, the government of India encourages its use only for stand-by<lb/> options or in the case of temporary disruption of renewable energy supply. The general rule of thumb<lb/> supposes that the technology with the lowest marginal cost and which is considered the most appropriate<lb/> and effective technological option for the area will be chosen.<lb/></p>

			<head>Achievements of the RGGVY<lb/></head>

			<figure>During the 10th plan, 235 projects sanctioned at an investment of INR 97.33 billion 41 (approximately<lb/> USD 2.43 billion) covered the electrification of 65 419 un-electrified villages and provision of free<lb/> electricity connections to 8.31 million BPL households (Ministry of Power, 2009a). At the end of the<lb/> 10th plan period (31/03/2007), 38 525 villages were electrified and 672 000 BPL households had<lb/> been provided with electric connections (see <ref type="table">Table 22</ref>).<lb/> After approving the continuation of RGGVY in the 11th plan, in September 2009, the MoP had sanctioned<lb/> 332 projects for the period covering the electrification of 49 736 un-electrified villages, the intensive<lb/> electrification of 242 439 electrified villages and free electricity connections to 16.2 million BPL households<lb/> (see <ref type="table">Table 21</ref>). During the 11th Five-Year Plan, focus has been on states that had a heavy backlog of un-<lb/>electrified villages and BPL households, as well as on special category states (such as north-eastern states,<lb/> Himachal, J &amp; K and Uttarakhand), border districts and districts led by left wing extremism.<lb/> In September 2009, a total of 567 projects had been sanctioned under the RGGVY, covering the<lb/> electrification of 118 499 villages, the intensive electrification of 354 375 already electrified villages<lb/> and the free electricity connections of 24.6 million BPL households at an estimated cost of<lb/> INR 262.56 billion (approximately USD 5.421 billion) as show in <ref type="table">Table 21</ref>.

			<head>3.2.2 The Remote Village Electrification (RVE) Programme<lb/> <ref type="table">Targets<lb/> Since 2005</ref>, the RVE programme of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energies (MNRE) has been<lb/> supplementing the efforts of the Ministry of Power (MoP) through complementary measures for<lb/> the provision of basic lighting/electricity facilities through renewable energy sources. The Remote<lb/> Village Electrification programme (RVE) is responsible for electrifying un-electrified remote census<lb/> villages (with a population of less than 100 inhabitants 42 ) and remote un-electrified hamlets of<lb/> electrified census villages where grid connection is either not feasible or not economical (because<lb/> they are located in forests, hills, deserts or islands) and where DDG projects are not implemented<lb/> by the RGGVY of the MoP. The scope of the RVE is the provision of electricity for:<lb/></p>

			<table> &quot; All un-electrified remote census villages by 2007;<lb/> 42 The electrification of villages comprising more than 100 inhabitants will usually be undertaken by the<lb/> RGGVY scheme through its DDG (decentralised distribution and generation) projects. To avoid overlap of<lb/> efforts, close co-ordination between the RRGVY and the MNRE is ensured mainly through the Rural<lb/> Electrification Corporation.<lb/> Page | 70<lb/>  All households of un-electrified remote census villages by 2012; and<lb/>  All un-electrified remote hamlets of electrified census villages by 2012. &quot; (Ministry of<lb/> New and Renewable Energies, 2003-2004)<lb/></table>

			<p>The RVE programme is implemented in the states by state-notified implementing agencies, which<lb/> receive 90% capital subsidy from the MNRE. A remote village or remote hamlet will be considered<lb/> electrified if at least 10% of the households are provided with lighting facility. Under the RVE<lb/> programme, the electrification process entails choosing the most adequate energy technologies<lb/> through the identification of locally available energy resources. However, in the case where these<lb/> solutions are proven unfeasible, and if the only means for electrification is through use of isolated<lb/> lighting systems (such as solar PV), these should be taken up. However, the remote villages<lb/> receiving them should not be declared electrified. In fact, where the population is scarce and<lb/> remote, there is often no other renewable energy option but the installation of solar photovoltaic<lb/> (SPV) home lighting systems. According to the MNRE, a total of 95%, a large share of remote census<lb/> villages are provided with solar photovoltaic home lighting systems. However, these villages are not<lb/> considered properly electrified until further solutions are implemented (Ministry of New and<lb/> Renewable <ref type="biblio">Energies, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Means of electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RVE programme, solar photovoltaic home lighting systems, small hydropower plants,<lb/> biomass gasification systems in conjunction with 100% producer gas engines or with dual-fuel<lb/> engines using non-edible vegetable oils, non-edible vegetable oil-based engines, biogas engines,<lb/> solar photovoltaic power plants are the most commonly used by the MNRE (Ministry of New and<lb/> Renewable <ref type="biblio">Energies, 2007</ref>). However, the vast majority, 95%, of remote census villages taken up for<lb/> electrification under the programme are provided with SPV home lighting systems.<lb/> Many villagers in remote areas serviced under the RVE programme that are not recipients of grid-<lb/>distributed power feel discriminated against when they are provided with what they feel is &quot; second-<lb/>class electricity &quot; . Such complaints have been taken up by some political parties which have been<lb/> exerting pressure for grid power to reach their constituents, as opposed to stand-alone systems. As<lb/> a consequence, the list of villages to be electrified under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE)<lb/> scheme is being shortened each year. In any case, such electrification is still considered an interim<lb/> solution as, ultimately, the grid is expected to reach these regions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Achievements of the RVE<lb/></head>

			<figure>The RVE programme of the MNRE covers remote un-electrified villages which are not covered under<lb/> the RGGVY. In March 2009, the cumulative sanctions under the RVE programme had reached<lb/> 9 355 villages and hamlets of which 5 410 have been successfully electrified.

			<head>3.2.3 The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM)<lb/></head>

			<p>The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission was launched on 23 November 2009 in a statement to<lb/> Parliament by the Union Minister for New and Renewable Energies. This mission is part of the 2008<lb/> Indian National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which seeks to reduce India&apos;s future<lb/> reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Although the JNNSM has not been established to foster<lb/> rural electrification per se, it does mention the use of solar energy as a means for rural<lb/> electrification, thus helping the MNRE with its electrification goals. By the end of the 13th Five-Year<lb/> Plan, in 2022, the JNNSM should have led to an installed capacity of 20 000 MW and the<lb/> deployment of 20 million solar lighting systems in rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.4 Description of the expected end-use of the electricity provided<lb/> under RGGVY and RVE<lb/></head>

			<p>Before 2004, rural electrification efforts were geared towards the electrification of villages and the<lb/> energisation of irrigation pump sets. The main use of electricity in rural settings was for irrigation<lb/> which allowed for the optimisation of crop yields and consequently grain production self-<lb/>sufficiency. Previously suffering from food deficits, India became a food surplus country thanks to<lb/> rural electrification efforts geared towards the agricultural sector. But this major economic benefit<lb/> was captured mainly by already well-off farmers, leaving aside rural industries and trades which<lb/> were not targeted by the electrification process (<ref type="biblio">Bhattacharyya, 2006</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the RGGVY and the RVE, villages should be provided with electricity not only for domestic<lb/> lighting, but also for productive end-uses, specifically targeting the development of economic<lb/> activities within a given rural area. Electrification is expected to reverse the downward trend in<lb/> agricultural growth which is plaguing rural India. Access to affordable and reliable electricity is<lb/> expected to meet the energy requirements of the agricultural sector by energising irrigation pump<lb/> sets as well as small and medium-sized industries, cold chains, health centres, schools, etc. Rural<lb/> households are expected to play an active role in the region&apos;s economic development, which should<lb/> lead to an increase in the revenue deriving from these activities. The final goal is the development<lb/> of productive activities which will generate funds to cover the costs incurred by power supply,<lb/> operation and maintenance of the systems.<lb/></p>

			<p>Some states, such as Punjab and Tamil Nadu, have decided to provide free electricity to farmers to<lb/> support their agriculture. In these states, other categories of customers, such as the domestic and<lb/> industry sectors, have been burdened with heavy tax rates to support the deficits created by the<lb/> provision of free electricity to agricultural consumers. According to the Associated Chamber of<lb/> Commerce of India (Assocham), these losses reach each year around USD 400 000 (22 % of annual<lb/> sales of power) in Punjab and USD 235 000 (6% of annual sales of power) in Tamil Nadu (<ref type="biblio">Assocham,<lb/> 2008</ref>). As a consequence of this free power provision, utilities in these states have been unable to<lb/> supply reliable electricity to their industrial sector, thus reducing their competitiveness vis à vis<lb/> other states, as noted by the Assocham. In addition, controversies over the allocation of free power<lb/> to farmers have worsened because farmers are using their electric pump sets for other purposes<lb/> than irrigation.<lb/> Page | 72<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 Institutional structures for rural electrification<lb/> 3.3.1 India&apos;s power sector reforms, and policy reforms to promote<lb/> electricity access<lb/></head>

			<p>The government of India has reformed the institutional and regulatory framework of its power<lb/> sector. Reforms have ranged from unbundling of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs), increased<lb/> involvement of the private sector in generation, transmission and distribution, to freer setting of<lb/> electricity tariffs (Asian Development <ref type="biblio">Bank, 2008</ref>). These reforms have led to furthering<lb/> electrification efforts in rural areas. The &quot; Power for All by 2012 &quot; initiative was launched by the<lb/> central government in 2001. The objectives of the programme are to ensure &quot; sufficient power to<lb/> achieve a GDP growth rate of 8%, reliable and quality power, optimum power costs, commercial<lb/> viability of the power industry as well as power for all &quot; (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Power, 2009c</ref>). The Electricity<lb/> Act of 2003 followed. It is currently the major piece of legislation covering generation, transmission<lb/> and distribution of electricity in India which compels utilities to supply electricity to all (including in<lb/> rural areas). Moreover, the National Electrification Policy (NEP) of 2005 (which states that the key<lb/> objective of the power sector is to supply electricity to all areas, including rural areas), the</p>

			<table>Rural<lb/> Electrification Policy of 2006 (provision of electricity to all households by 2009, quality and reliable<lb/> power at reasonable rates and minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day as a<lb/> merit good by 2012) and the National Tariff Policy of 2006, were all policies encouraging<lb/> electrification efforts in rural India. These policies have improved the financial and institutional<lb/> status of the state utilities, and of the state-level generation, transmission and distribution utilities.<lb/> They have widened the state governments&apos; scope of action in rural electrification efforts. As a result<lb/> of the power sector reform process, most state utilities have been unbundled and split into<lb/> separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution of power.<lb/></table>

			<head>3.3.2 The central and state governments&apos; responsibilities in rural<lb/> electrification programmes<lb/></head>

			<p>The launching of the RGGVY scheme in 2005 marked a turning point in India&apos;s rural electrification<lb/> efforts. In accord with the Electricity Act of 2003, the role of the central government became larger,<lb/> as both central and state governments took over joint responsibility for rural electrification. State<lb/> governments are now required to prepare rural electrification plans designed to assess in detail the<lb/> means by which electricity is to be delivered − i.e. through grid extension or stand-alone systems −<lb/> to the un-electrified households in their constituency. These plans also describe which available<lb/> technologies will be considered, how compliance with environmental norms will be met, as well as<lb/> more general information such as the number of un-electrified households in the target region and<lb/> their distance from the grid. These plans are then co-ordinated between state governments, state<lb/> utilities and other agencies by the Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), a governmental<lb/> body under the Ministry of Power that acts as the nodal agency for the RGGVY. State governments<lb/> are also required to ensure revenue stability of their state utilities if electricity is provided at a tariff<lb/> below what is set by the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, to supply electricity to rural and<lb/> urban households without interruption, to deploy franchisees and to appoint independent<lb/> franchisees for monitoring the work. At the central level, the MoP develops rural electrification<lb/> policies, monitors the programme&apos;s progress, sanctions projects and releases funds for project<lb/> implementation.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.3 Institutional structure – implementing agencies<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RGGVY, state governments through their State Power Utilities (SPUs) are responsible for<lb/> implementing the RGGVY in their territory. Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) 43 can also<lb/> assist the states in carrying out rural electrification projects through project formulation, planning<lb/> and monitoring, and the provision of goods and services. The Rural Electrification Corporation (REC)<lb/> has therefore entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with some PSUs, namely NTPC,<lb/> Powergrid, NHPC and DVC to make available management expertise and capabilities to the states<lb/> that wish to work with them. The REC, as the nodal agency of the RGVVY, not only acts as a lending<lb/> agency, but also co-ordinates activities between the MoP and the MNRE, sets the framework for<lb/> project implementation and monitors and evaluates projects to ensure their timely<lb/> implementation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Under the Remote Village Electrification programme, state nodal agencies are responsible for the<lb/> implementation of rural electrification projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.4 Institutional structure – lending agencies<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RGGVY, the MoP grants 90% of the cost of rural electrification projects. States are<lb/> supposed to cover the remaining 10% of the cost either from their own funds or through loans from<lb/> the REC or other institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The three main financial agencies in the power sector are the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd.<lb/> (REC), the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency<lb/> (IREDA). Only the REC is authorised to act as the nodal agency or lending agency for rural<lb/> electrification projects under RGGVY. IREDA supports a much wider range of projects in rural areas,<lb/> including minor-scale rural electrification schemes through renewable energy applications focusing<lb/> mainly on biomass and solar PV lighting systems. The PFC lends only to major generation and<lb/> transmission projects, but not to rural electrification programmes.<lb/> The Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd. was created in 1969 as a wholly government-owned<lb/> enterprise or nodal agency exclusively responsible for the implementation of rural electrification<lb/> schemes, through long-term financing and promotion of rural electrification projects in India.<lb/> Through the development of the power infrastructure in rural India, it has participated in the<lb/> development of the agricultural sector. Since its creation, the REC is India&apos;s main financing<lb/> institution for rural electrification and benefits from strong support from the government of India.<lb/> Today, although the REC continues to foster the development of rural electrification in India, it also<lb/> finances other segments of the power sector. The REC administers grants and provides loan<lb/> assistance to the State Electricity Boards/State Power Utilities for investment in rural electrification<lb/> schemes through its head office and 17 field offices. These field offices are essential to the work of<lb/> the REC as they collaborate with the state governments in which they are settled to help them<lb/> formulate various schemes and loan sanctions. On the basis of the proposals made by the states,<lb/> the REC divides responsibilities for electrification between the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of<lb/> New and Renewable Energies. In this respect, the REC decides which villages or hamlets will be<lb/> considered remote (where grid connection is either not feasible or not cost-effective) and therefore<lb/> which will be electrified through either the RGGVY or the Remote Village Renewable Energy<lb/> Programme (RVREP).<lb/></p>

			<head>Page | 74<lb/></head>

			<p>The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) was established in 1987 under the<lb/> administrative control of the MNRE for the promotion of financial assistance in favour of renewable<lb/> energy and energy efficiency projects. One of the main objectives of IREDA is to act as a fund for the<lb/> financing and promotion of new and renewable energy sources and to assist in their rapid<lb/> commercialisation. In this respect, IREDA has found its role in providing financial support for the use<lb/> of renewable energies in the electrification of remote villages under the RVE programme of the<lb/> MNRE.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3.5 Institutional structure – monitoring and quality check<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to keep up the pace of electrification, the MoP has asked the states to form state-level<lb/> Coordination Committees. These committees are required to meet regularly in order to resolve any<lb/> potential issue that could slow the pace of project development. States are also required to form<lb/> District Committees with representatives from various stakeholders, including elected members<lb/> and local communities. These District Committees help in the co-ordination and review of the<lb/> coverage of electrification within the district. The Ministry of Power has noted that where these<lb/> Committees were active and met regularly, progress in rural electrification projects had improved<lb/> (Press Information <ref type="biblio">Bureau, 2009</ref>).<lb/> In addition, a milestone-based monitoring mechanism has been introduced to monitor the progress<lb/> of RGGVY projects from project sanction up to project completion. A web-based monitoring system<lb/> has also been introduced which works at village level. Through this monitoring system,<lb/> implementing agencies are supposed to provide all the data relating to activities carried out at<lb/> village level, the result of quality inspections, the state of fund utilisation, the state of village<lb/> electrification, etc.<lb/> Page | 75<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4 Costs, incentives and tariffs<lb/> 3.4.1 Costs of the RGGVY<lb/></head>

			<p>The total costs of schemes under RGGVY have recently been estimated to reach USD 11.3 billion,<lb/> one-tenth of which is allocated to decentralised distributed generation (DDG). This includes projects<lb/> under both 10th and 11th Plans to be completed by March 2012. Total grants allocated by the<lb/> central government are expected to amount to USD 10.2 billion (INR 459 billion)</p>

			<head>. 44<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RGGVY scheme, 90% of the project costs is funded by the Ministry of Power. The state<lb/> governments fund the remaining 10% through either long-term loans from the REC or other<lb/> financial institutions, or out of their own budgets. However, government subsidies under the<lb/> RGGVY are expected to be allocated only once to finance the least-cost village electrification<lb/> projects. At the same time, rural households are expected to play an active role in the region&apos;s<lb/> economic development, which should lead to an increase in the revenue arising from productive<lb/> activities. The purpose is that the development of productive activities will generate enough<lb/> revenues to cover the costs incurred in power supply, operation and maintenance, and will also<lb/> ensure that no additional government money will be needed to fund the replacement in the future<lb/> of any part of the system. In the event the RGGVY scheme is not implemented in a satisfactory way,<lb/> capital subsidies will then be converted into interest-bearing loans as an incentive to correct the<lb/> implementation of the scheme. Up to 1% of the total subsidy will be allocated to research and<lb/> technology development, capacity building and, inter alia, the financing of pilot studies and<lb/> complementary projects under the rural electrification scheme.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For un-electrified households below the poverty line (BPL), electrification projects are 100%<lb/> financed by capital subsidies up to approximately USD 45 (INR 2 200) per rural household. <ref type="table">Table 25<lb/></ref> shows the cost norms defined by the Ministry of Power for village electrification.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4.2 Costs of the RVE programme<lb/></head>

			<p>The total cost for the implementation of the</p>

			<table>Remote Village Electrification programme (which<lb/> focuses on those remote villages that are not targeted by the RGGVY), is estimated to amount to<lb/> INR 17 750 million (USD 354 million) over the 11th Five-Year Plan. Similarly to the RGGVY, Central<lb/> Financial Assistance (CFA) of the MNRE grants a subsidy covering up to 90% of the cost of the<lb/> project implementation, up to a predefined maximum of INR 18 000 (USD 360) per household<lb/> (Ministry of Power, 2008). In line with current practice under the RGGVY, the MNRE also offers a<lb/> 100% capital subsidy for BPL household connections.<lb/></table>

			<head>3.4.3 Framework conditions and business incentives<lb/> Lending agencies<lb/></head>

			<p>To encourage banks and other lending institutions to consider rural electrification initiatives<lb/> favourably, the government of India has been working with the National Bank for Agriculture and<lb/> Rural Development (NABARD) and the Reserve Bank of India to facilitate norms, guidelines and<lb/> limits for capital costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Business incentives<lb/></head>

			<p>The Electricity Act of 2003 has contributed to increase competition in the electricity sector. This act<lb/> has given private investors access to all power sector operations. As a consequence, state<lb/> governments encourage the private sector to invest in rural electrification projects. To do so, many<lb/> state governments have established administrative mechanisms to facilitate the process of approval<lb/> and clearance for the setting-up of small and medium-sized industries. Those specifically targeted<lb/> are industries that seek to use local resources for decentralised generation projects and stand-alone<lb/> systems. In this respect, a &quot; special enabling dispensation &quot; is considered for stand-alone systems of<lb/> up to 1 MW which use locally available resources and are based on proven cost-effective<lb/> technologies. Such projects will receive immediate approval for the following issues:<lb/>  &quot; Change of land-use area as long as norms are satisfied;<lb/>  Pollution clearance if the technology is proven to be within norms;<lb/>  Safety clearances on the basis of self-certification conveyed to concerned authorities<lb/> (such certification making the developer fully liable for any infraction to safety<lb/> regulations). &quot; (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Power, 2005</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<p>State governments are also responsible for setting up institutional arrangements for any<lb/> maintenance service or technical support for renewable energy systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>After sales approach (spare parts, maintenance)<lb/></head>

			<p>To make sure that an after sales approach is integrated in the design of the project before its<lb/> implementation, the RGGVY stipulates that any project seeking financial support must incorporate<lb/> plans for regular maintenance and upgrading. Moreover, the projects should demonstrate that<lb/> measures will be taken to minimise technical and commercial losses.<lb/></p>

			<p>To ensure project sustainability under the RVE, annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a<lb/> minimum 10-year duration warranty must include the replacement of parts or components such as<lb/> batteries, electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. These AMCs guarantee efficient after-sales support. They<lb/> will be further detailed below.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4.4 Customer tariff setting<lb/></head>

			<p>A major problem in India&apos;s electricity market is that electricity is often not paid for. Either electricity<lb/> is not billed for or when it is, it is not paid. Also, electricity theft is rampant, with annual losses<lb/> amounting to USD 4.5 billion, roughly 1.5% of GDP (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2004</ref>). This loss of revenues<lb/> amounts to a mass of implicit government subsidy, as noted in Electricity in India (IEA, 2002b), and<lb/> undermines the efficiency and long-term sustainability of the supply system, and in the long run<lb/> does not benefit electricity consumers.<lb/> Electricity tariffs are also a sensitive issue in India. Below poverty line households will be provided<lb/> with free electricity connections. By 2012 these electricity connections will be financed with<lb/> government capital up to INR 2 200 (approximately USD 45) per household in all rural habitations.<lb/> Those households</table>

			<p>above the poverty line will pay for their connection at prescribed connection<lb/> charges and no government subsidy will be released for this purpose. In the case of decentralised<lb/> systems, capital subsidies should not give rise to too many differences between the price that<lb/> remote villages powered by DDG systems will pay for electricity, and the price paid by villages<lb/> connected to the grid. But rural electricity tariffs are often lower than the average cost of electricity<lb/> supply, and state governments are responsible for making budgetary provisions for subsidised<lb/> electricity supply.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.5 Country-specific challenges and how they were addressed<lb/> Franchisees and ownership<lb/></head>

			<p>The creation of franchisees for the management of local power distribution in rural settings is a<lb/> requirement under the RGGVY. Because these structures reduce commercial losses through more<lb/> efficient billing and revenue collection, they ensure stable delivery of electricity. Franchisees can be<lb/> different legal entities, such as non-governmental organisations, co-operatives or individual<lb/> entrepreneurs. While their exact nature or structure may vary from one franchisee to another, they<lb/> all have common activities: they must purchase bulk power, and see to routine operation and<lb/> maintenance of the distribution infrastructure. Franchisees are granted a distribution licence<lb/> through a competitive bidding process. Those offering the cheapest bulk supply tariff will be<lb/> allowed to operate under a contract with the state governments. Franchisees are particularly<lb/> effective in the management of electricity provision and recovery as they are in close contact with<lb/> the targeted communities, and this has led to a stronger sense of ownership of the electrification<lb/> process.<lb/></p>

			<head>Management and reduction of losses<lb/></head>

			<p>Illegal hooking is still rampant in India, particularly in the rural villages, which are by definition<lb/> difficult to control. Through the 2003 Electricity Act, the Indian government made a fundamental<lb/> amendment to the Electricity Act of 1910, rendering theft of electricity a heavily penalised criminal<lb/> offence. Moreover, under the RGGVY, to prevent illegal hooking and so reduce commercial,<lb/> transmission and distribution losses, high-voltage distribution systems (HVDS) are being installed.<lb/> Through HVDS, the voltage profile is also improved and electricity supply is more reliable.<lb/> Franchisees also play an important role in reducing electricity theft, since they are responsible for<lb/> recovering payments and are in close contact with the targeted communities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Corruption and mismanagement of funds have also been plaguing the system, which has caused the<lb/> RGGVY to progress unevenly in the states. To balance this, the release of funds by the REC under<lb/> the RGGVY scheme is now linked to the achievement of predetermined milestones, leading to more<lb/> control of the system. Also the electronic transfer of funds is used right up to the contractor level to<lb/> counter losses from fund mismanagement.<lb/></p>

			<head>Participation of local communities for operation and maintenance<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the Remote Village Electrification (RVE) programme of the Ministry of New and Renewable<lb/> Energies, effective operation, maintenance and sustainability of the projects is the responsibility of<lb/> Page | 78<lb/> the state governments. The participation of the local community is sought at the inception of the<lb/> project and efforts are made to ensure at least 15 years of operation and maintenance. To this end,<lb/> state governments aim to organise the training of local youth and to set up village committees.<lb/> However, as renewable energy systems develop rapidly, there is often an insufficient number of<lb/> trained workers who know how to maintain and operate systems such as, for instance, solar PV. A<lb/> more systematic approach to training would ensure better maintenance of the installed systems<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Baker and McKenzie, 2008</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Progress monitoring and maintenance<lb/></head>

			<p>A Three-Tier Quality Monitoring Mechanism (TTQM) for the projects under the RGGVY has been put<lb/> in place (Ministry of <ref type="biblio">Power, 2009e</ref>). For the first tier, a project implementing agency (PIA) works<lb/> with a third-party inspection agency to ascertain that all the materials used in the projects and<lb/> workmanship are conform to specifications. The REC is responsible for the second tier and will<lb/> inspect works and materials. It will also include quality checks of materials at the pre-shipment<lb/> stage. In the third tier, independent evaluators will be contracted by the Ministry of Power for<lb/> random evaluations (1% of villages) of the supply and construction of the projects. These<lb/> independent evaluators will report back to the REC or to the responsible supervisors in the second<lb/> tier, and the REC will make sure that the negative reports are followed up on. This monitoring<lb/> system has been set up to ensure that projects are properly implemented and to contribute to their<lb/> efficiency and long-term sustainability.<lb/></p>

			<p>The RVE also encourages the setting-up of annual maintenance contracts (AMC) with a minimum<lb/> 10-year warranty which includes the replacement of parts or components such as batteries,<lb/> electronics, lamps, bulbs, etc. to secure proper and sustained energy supply services. If some<lb/> projects are not covered by the 10-year AMC, sustainability is ensured through revenue collection<lb/> from electricity consumers, which should cover operational expenses. After the AMCs expire,<lb/> revenues could also be used to cover maintenance and repair expenses or replacement of spare<lb/> parts and defective components.<lb/></p>

			<head>Availability and sufficiency of power supply<lb/></head>

			<p>Under the RGGVY, state governments are responsible for providing adequate supply of electricity<lb/> with hours of supply being equal for rural and urban dwellers. States are responsible for ensuring<lb/> that at least 6 to 8 hours/day of electricity are supplied in rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implementation of other policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Energy efficiency clauses are one of the keys to the success of a rural electrification policy. The<lb/> government of India has made sure that productive processes are efficient or less energy-intensive<lb/> than standard ones. This applies particularly to the agricultural sector, which has been encouraged<lb/> to use economically viable irrigation pump sets and other energy-efficient farming equipment.<lb/> According to the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), correct implementation of demand-side<lb/> management policies could save up to an estimated 15% of electricity consumption. The legal<lb/> framework for this IEP was provided by the Indian Energy Conservation Act 2001 the aim of which<lb/> was to accelerate energy efficiency in India. Since 2002, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has<lb/> been the governmental agency responsible for implementing the Energy Conservation Act. Some of<lb/> the major initiatives led by the BEE include:<lb/></p>

			<p> Bachat Lamp Yojana: Promotion of energy-efficient and high-quality compact<lb/> fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to replace incandescent bulbs in households;<lb/>  Standards &amp; Labelling Scheme: Targeting high energy end-use equipments and<lb/> appliances for minimum energy performance standards;<lb/> households, remains to be seen. A minimum of 20 000 MW of power is estimated to be required to<lb/> meet the needs of the RGGVY alone (<ref type="biblio">Vidyasagar, 2007</ref>). The productive use of electricity at the<lb/> household level would support load development and secure the viability of the electrification<lb/> efforts. Without a defined strategy for encouraging productive use of electricity at the household<lb/> level, the viability of the RGGVY scheme may be undermined. Moreover, the economic<lb/> sustainability of the electrification efforts is also undermined by the lack of systematic evaluation of<lb/> how operations&apos; costs can be recovered. Failure to assess the real potential for cost recovery may<lb/> lead to the need for-long term provision of government grants, way beyond the end of the<lb/> programme (<ref type="biblio">Vidyasagar, 2007</ref>). Equally critical is the issue of the effective maintenance and proper<lb/> upgrading of the rural electricity infrastructure as well as its economic sustainability, which will<lb/> depend on the states and utilities&apos; long-term involvement. Finally, to reach the targets set under the<lb/> RGGVY in 2012, it is estimated that state utilities would have to &quot; gear up their effort by ten times &quot;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Vidyasagar, 2007</ref>) and provide substantial financial commitment.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 South Africa<lb/></head>

			<p>Since 2000, the government of South Africa has been seeking to provide universal access to basic<lb/> services, including electricity. In 2009 South Africa achieved 75% electrification with 88% urban and<lb/> 55% rural populations who gained access to electricity services (IEA, 2009b). South Africa&apos;s<lb/> electrification has been achieved mainly through grid extension. In the future, more renewable<lb/> sources may facilitate further electrification if barriers to their widespread use are overcome. South<lb/> Africa&apos;s energy sector, electrification efforts and remaining challenges are described below.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Introduction and country description<lb/></head>

			<p>Rural electrification in South Africa is part and parcel of the transformation of South African society.<lb/> Since the first free election in 1994, all South African policies − including those of electricity<lb/> provision − contain an element of change. The objective is to eradicate historical inequalities based<lb/> on ethnicity. While a large proportion of poor people live in rural areas, there are also very many of<lb/> them in urban areas. The urban poor live predominantly in townships or in informal settlements.<lb/> During the Apartheid years, Black, Coloured and Asian people were not allowed to live in the same<lb/> areas as the white part of the population. Consequently each city, town and village had established<lb/> areas with good service delivery, and areas with poor or no service delivery. To date, there are still<lb/> areas without basic services such as water, sanitation and access to electricity. This chapter focuses<lb/> on the experience with electrification of the poor who live mainly, but far from exclusively, in the<lb/> rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>South Africa is known for its diversity in cultures, languages and religious beliefs. Eleven official<lb/> languages are recognised. English is the most commonly spoken language in official and commercial<lb/> public life. Yet English is only the fifth most–spoken home language (South Africa <ref type="biblio">Info, 2008</ref>). The<lb/> population is mostly composed of Africans, Coloured and Asians (see <ref type="table">Table 26</ref>), who are still often<lb/> living in different geographical zones from the Whites.

			<p>Most of South Africa&apos;s energy supply comes from coal (see <ref type="table">Table 27</ref>). South Africa ranks fourth in<lb/> the world in the production of hard coal, and is the fifth-largest exporter of hard coal in the world<lb/> (IEA, 2008). In 2007, South Africa&apos;s electricity generation reached 266 Twh (IEA, 2009a). South Africa<lb/> has an installed capacity of 43 650 MW (<ref type="biblio">Platts, 2008</ref>) which represents close to 34.5% of the African<lb/> continent&apos;s total installed capacity. Electricity is produced mainly from coal (94%). Eskom – the<lb/> national power utility – generates 97% of the electricity. Around 55% of the distribution is managed<lb/> by Eskom and 45% by the municipalities (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006a). Since<lb/> 1994 no new generation capacity has been built. Because of strong economic growth, rapid<lb/> industrialisation and a massive electrification programme, Eskom&apos;s surplus capacity has been<lb/> reduced to below safe production levels. In January 2008, massive power outages occurred<lb/> nationwide. South Africa has since embarked on aggressive demand-side management (DSM),<lb/> energy efficiency, as well as planning new generating capacity programmes. South Africa has one of<lb/> the lowest electricity tariffs in the world with an average selling price at around USD 0.027 per kWh.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2000 the South African government declared that everybody should have access to basic<lb/> services, including electricity and water. Access to modern energy and water has become a social<lb/> right that must be addressed at national, provincial and municipality levels. The electrification rate<lb/> of South Africa is 75% in 2009. (Electrification is registered as electrification of households and not<lb/> as the number of people). But there is a great variation in the electrification rate between the<lb/> provinces, with Eastern Cape being mainly a rural area and having the lowest electrification rate<lb/> (60%) and Western Cape having the highest rate (86%) as shown in <ref type="table">Table 28</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Institutional structures for rural electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>The governance of the electricity sector is the responsibility of the Department of Energy (DoE).<lb/> Before 1994 Eskom was responsible for the electrification of the country. Eskom held a state-<lb/>supported monopoly and would electrify an area upon instruction from the government or connect<lb/> a consumer if the consumer would pay. There was systematic neglect of full service delivery to the<lb/> Coloured, Black and Asian communities. In 1994, after the first free election was held, it was<lb/> estimated that approximately 6 million households (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2009b</ref>) were without<lb/> electricity. The backlog in electrification was largely race-based and hence electrification became<lb/> part of the national priorities to redress the errors and inequalities of the past.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 1994, Parliament approved a plan to ensure equal access to basic services for all South Africans.<lb/> The National Energy Regulator 47 was given the task to develop and oversee the implementation of<lb/> the Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP). Eskom was tasked by NERSA to undertake<lb/> the implementation through the use of contractors as part of any other Eskom business. In 2001 it<lb/> was decided that the DoE would be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the<lb/> electrification programme.<lb/></p>

			<p>Municipalities are now responsible for reticulation and distribution of electricity to households as<lb/> well as to small businesses. Eskom maintains direct supply of electricity to larger industries. In 2008,<lb/> Page | 85<lb/> Eskom generated approximately 97% of the electricity and distributed some 55% to end-consumers<lb/> while the rest was sold to the municipalities, that in turn distributed it to the end-consumers<lb/> (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2006b).<lb/> In 2001 the DoE mandated that not only Eskom but also registered municipalities could receive<lb/> national funding to roll out the national electrification programme. DoE is responsible for<lb/> monitoring their actual performance and ensuring that corrective measures are taken in case of<lb/> poor or non-performance. Such poor or non-performance occurs in municipalities that are licensed<lb/> but not yet experienced in rolling out grid connections. For this reason, DoE has occasionally<lb/> provided one-off capacity building support to such municipalities.<lb/></p>

			<p>The electrification programme benefits from a special allocation from National Treasury and not<lb/> funded through cross-subsidies. Once households are electrified, consumers are billed by the<lb/> municipalities. The main funding of the National Electrification Programme is through the National<lb/> Budget. External donor agencies, in particular the German KfW, support the electrification of<lb/> schools and clinics. Also NORAD, the Norwegian agency for development co-operation, provides<lb/> support in the form of capacity building, for example to monitor sale and management of<lb/> electricity, also at the municipal level.<lb/></p>

			<p>In remote rural areas, where the lowest-capacity grid system cannot be supplied within the capital<lb/> expenditure limit and outside the 3-year grid electrification plan, provision is made for non-grid<lb/> electrification through solar home systems (SHS) (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2009c</ref>). An amount<lb/> equivalent to the lower end of average electrification costs is fully subsidised by the government to<lb/> cover part of the capital costs of non-grid electrification. Rural end-users will purchase non-grid<lb/> electricity from the service provider who will, among other things, provide maintenance for the<lb/> SHS. Since these cannot meet the cooking/thermal needs of households, one of the requirements of<lb/> the DoE is that the suppliers of non-grid technologies augment their services by selling thermal fuels<lb/> such as paraffin and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The installation of SHS must be such that the<lb/> maximum densification of the installed base is achieved in a specific area. The service provider, who<lb/> holds a monopoly for servicing an area, must make sure that universal access is achieved in a village<lb/> identified as a non-grid area. In early 1999, the DoE issued a call for proposals for non-grid rural<lb/> electrification. Of the 28 responses received, six consortia were selected through an open bidding<lb/> process to participate in the first phase of a programme to provide non-grid electricity services to<lb/> identified areas. The six private companies are Summer Sun Trading (Pty) Ltd; Shine The Way cc;<lb/> ILITHA Cooperative; Electricité de France; Total Fina Elf Group; Nuon RAPS Utility (Pty) Ltd; Solar<lb/> Vision (Pty) Ltd, and a EUR 50 million support from KfW.<lb/></p>

			<p>The electrification programme deadline has been moved from 2012 to 2014 by which time the<lb/> backlog in electrification should be completed.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Description of current electrification programmes and<lb/> objectives<lb/></head>

			<p>The Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP) consists of a grid-connection programme,<lb/> a non-grid programme, household connections, electrification of schools and of all registered<lb/> clinics. The main focus is the grid connection, and non-grid connection is only used if there are no<lb/> other feasible options to extend the grid within a foreseeable future.<lb/></p>

			<p>Before 1994, South Africa only focused on electrification of urban areas. In 1993, some 30% of<lb/> households were electrified. Since 1994, there has been a fundamental shift towards electrifying all<lb/> households, including those living in rural areas. The grid electrification rate has since then<lb/> increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in March 2008 (Department of <ref type="biblio">Minerals and Energy, 2008b</ref>),<lb/> that is 4.5 million more households (<ref type="table">Table 29</ref>). The increase in coverage is the result of both<lb/> extending the grid to new communities such as rural areas and connecting the unconnected in<lb/> already electrified areas. The electrification rates vary depending on the complexities of grid<lb/> extension and population density, with the relatively higher-density areas having been electrified<lb/> first.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2009, 3.4 million households still remain to be electrified in South Africa (<ref type="biblio">Mketsi, 2009</ref>) of which<lb/> about half (1.7 million) live in informal settlements. It is a priority of the South African government<lb/> that the problems faced by the 1.7 million households living in informal settlements be resolved by<lb/> their municipal councils, before electrification can be implemented. The areas must either be<lb/> formalised, or the households must move to other formalised human settlements before they can<lb/> benefit from the national electrification programme. This is because it is not cost-effective to<lb/> electrify an unstable dwelling that may be demolished or destroyed by any climatic occurrence. For<lb/> the 1.7 million households in formal settlements, a plan, including budget, is in place to ensure<lb/> connection before 2014. A major challenge in the household electrification programme is the actual<lb/> housing backlog, for which a special policy has been drawn up (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2009d</ref>).<lb/> The INEP includes special plans for electrification of all clinics and all schools to catch up with all<lb/> remaining backlogs. Schools and clinics can be electrified by using funds from the INEP or through<lb/> donor funding. Adherence to all agreed technical standards is required, whether for grid or non-grid<lb/> connections. By 2007, full electrification of all registered health clinics in the country had been<lb/> successfully completed one year ahead of schedule. By 2007, 700 schools had been electrified but<lb/> the programme has been behind schedule, largely because of poor information abut the number of<lb/> schools to be dealt with in the smaller municipalities (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2009b; Seshotlho,<lb/> 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past years, the DoE has undertaken systematic monitoring of the INEP&apos;s socio-economic<lb/> impact (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2009j</ref>). Monitoring is carried out among newly electrified<lb/> consumers. (In the longer run it will be interesting to undertake broader economic assessments to<lb/> locate possible long-term changes.) This monitoring exercise has revealed that the majority, 96%, of<lb/> electrified households use electricity for lighting and TV; 63% use electricity also for cooking; a large<lb/> proportion of the population, 34%, use electricity for heating. In comparison, the majority of un-<lb/>electrified households use candles for lighting, use wood or paraffin for cooking and wood for<lb/> heating (see following charts).<lb/></p>

			<p>The costs of non-grid electrification, generally viewed as a temporary solution, are less than 10% of<lb/> full electrification costs. The ambition is to achieve a national grid-based supply, and the plan is to<lb/> complete the full-scale national electrification by 2014. However, the currently approved budget<lb/> cycle covers the period up to March 2008-2012 (see <ref type="table">Table 31</ref>).<lb/> As can be seen from <ref type="table">Table 31</ref>, future expenditures are expected to increase, partly because of<lb/> higher costs and partly because the number of connection activities has increased. The costs per<lb/> connection vary greatly from province to province and from year to year and the differences in<lb/> costs are largely caused by infrastructure specifics (<ref type="table">Table 32</ref>).<lb/> Adherence to all agreed technical standards is required, whether electrification takes place through<lb/> grid connection or through non-grid specifications. Specific standards adopted as national standards<lb/> under the auspices of the South African Bureau of Standards exist for the full electrification<lb/> installation.<lb/> decided that basic services are to be provided by the government, the concern is on optimising and<lb/> providing long-term best economic solutions rather than short-term financial solutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pricing<lb/></head>

			<table>Sustainable implementation and possible adjustment of current tariff policies are open for<lb/> discussion. Eskom&apos;s average selling price was ZAR 0.26 (USD 0.034) in 1979, dropping to ZAR 0.17<lb/> (USD 0.022) in 2005 (Molefe, 2008). These low tariffs are one of the causes of the current electricity<lb/> shortage across South Africa. 49 Because Eskom has sold electricity at ZAR 0.20 (USD 0.027)/kWh and<lb/> imported electricity from neighbouring countries at prices around ZAR 0.05 (USD 0.007</table>

			<p>), it has not<lb/> been financially feasible for South Africa − as it would not be for any country − to install new power<lb/> generation. In South Africa alone, the generation margin was only 4% in 2008, leading to endless<lb/> power cuts and systematic load shedding. It is now generally accepted that tariff changes are<lb/> needed on top of tariff increases. It is estimated that tariffs will double over a three-year period<lb/> with the first average 28% increase having already taken effect in 2008. The current debate includes<lb/> considerations on differential tariff increases to protect the poor, a &quot; home-light &quot; tariff for the low-<lb/>income sector, a similar tariff for small, micro and medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs), and time-of-<lb/>use tariffs. This debate is in line with South Africa&apos;s rural electrification agenda, as new power<lb/> generation will be necessary to service more households.<lb/></p>

			<head>Employment<lb/></head>

			<p>Employment is a major challenge in South Africa. The average official 50 unemployment figures are<lb/> above 20% (see <ref type="table">Table 33</ref>), excluding the under-employed in the rural and urban areas or those who<lb/> are not registered in employment agencies.<lb/></p>

			<p>As indicated by the results of the 2009 Socio-Economic Survey undertaken by the Department of<lb/> Energy, the rural electrification programme has generated 32 995 jobs over the last eight years.<lb/> Payment for electricity is an issue for people who have no or very little income. Many cases of<lb/> domestic violence in newly electrified households have been amply documented. It is argued that<lb/> domestic trouble starts over priorities when resources are scarce (Habitat for Humanity, 2009).<lb/> However, the long-term effect of ensuring universal access to electricity should lead to general<lb/> opportunities for a broad-based economic development. Providing an area, including a rural area,<lb/> with modern energy can be seen as a tool to attract businesses that can generate jobs locally, for<lb/> example in tourism. There are many examples of increased tourism along the entire coastline of<lb/> South Africa. These jobs and facilities could not have been created without the provision of<lb/> electricity in the area. The impact on long-term economic development will be interesting to follow<lb/> and assess.<lb/></p>

			<head>Capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>Current generating capacity in Southern Africa is insufficient to meet the demand and the reserve<lb/> margin is below a safe 10% operating margin. In 2009, South Africa&apos;s maximum installed capacity<lb/> reached 36 208 MW. National plans are in place to expand the power supply, effectively doubling<lb/> installed generation to some 80 000 MW by 2025 with associated grid expansion and strengthening,<lb/> but the implementation of these plans is surprisingly slow. South Africa has not built a power plant<lb/> in over 20 years 51 and, in the meantime, the national expertise to plan, take decisions and manage<lb/> the complex implementation process has eroded.<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy efficiency<lb/></head>

			<p>The productive economy, including the building stock and residential appliances, was established in<lb/> an environment of low tariffs and abundant supply. The principle &quot; save power &quot; was virtually<lb/> unheard of until 2005 when South Africa launched its first national strategy for energy efficiency.<lb/> Despite this new strategy, it was not until 2008 − when severe blackouts hit the country − that<lb/> South African decision makers were able to win support for changes in the tariff regime and for the<lb/> creation of energy efficiency targets. The shortage of power is now so severe that nationally<lb/> mandated energy efficiency measures have been introduced. Large users of energy have been<lb/> instructed to save 10% power, and municipalities have also asked local customers to reduce<lb/> electricity consumption. There has been some confusion in the public debate in South Africa where<lb/> some argue that supplying electricity to the poor is the cause of the present shortage. However, this<lb/> is unlikely because of the relatively low consumption of poor households. Industry and urban<lb/> residents are the largest consumers and have been benefiting for a long time. National energy<lb/> efficiency efforts should be directed primarily to those who consume the most electricity and<lb/> whose potential for savings are the greatest. In an attempt to maximise and accelerate the<lb/> reduction of the housing backlog, energy efficiency has largely been overlooked in the design and<lb/> construction process. Principles are now established to correct these errors and ensure that all<lb/> houses, including the very small ones, comply with the best-practice energy efficiency standards.<lb/> South African standard SANS204 does prescribe maximum standards for energy consumption.<lb/> National departments and donor agencies are ready to support municipalities&apos; efforts to upgrade<lb/> the housing and building stock so as to prevent future negative impacts on climate change for<lb/> having neglected the construction industry. The DoE launched the appliance labelling programme<lb/> for energy efficiency in 2004 in accordance with the EU standards and labelling programme.<lb/> Unfortunately, there is no financial support to roll out the programme. This is regretful as South<lb/> Africa and the whole of Africa increasingly receive outdated appliances. The DoE will soon start an<lb/> industrial energy efficiency programme focusing on system optimisation with the support of the<lb/> United Nations Industrial and Development Organization (UNIDO), the Swiss State Secretariat for<lb/> Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Finally, the<lb/> DoE is also in the process of signing an energy efficiency project for the building sector to improve<lb/> efficiency in the construction of buildings and houses, including the use of appliances.<lb/></p>

			<table>Page | 94<lb/> Non-grid electrification programme<lb/> Off-grid electrification is carried out by private-sector service providers (concessionaires) who have<lb/> successfully tendered for concessions in designated areas. The non-grid electrification programme<lb/> which expected to install 300 000 solar home systems (SHS) in 1998 has not managed to reach its<lb/> objective. To date, only around 50 000 SHS have been installed and programmes are running in only<lb/> a couple of provinces. Lack of political will and government support has thwarted the process. Some<lb/> concessionaires have been providing maintenance for the systems, charging on a fee-for-service<lb/> basis, while others have not provided this service. Non-payment of bills has also been a cause for<lb/> concern in most concessionaires and lack of expected government capital subsidies has delayed<lb/> much of the work. Decision making concerning the definition of a non-grid area has also caused<lb/> delays and costs to the concessionaires. These difficulties have weakened the financial stability of<lb/> the concessionaires and delayed the installation process.<lb/></table>

			<head>Renewable energy<lb/></head>

			<p>Poor policy implementation and lack of clear financial and legal regimes have constrained the<lb/> development and introduction of new renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, modern<lb/> bioenergy, etc. Only in 2009 has renewable energy officially been accepted as &quot; real &quot; power and the<lb/> first national feed-in tariff scheme was established (National Energy Regulator South Africa, 2009).<lb/> South Africa has one of the best sun regimes in the world. Yet it has one of the lowest penetrations<lb/> of solar water heaters (SWH). Experience with non-grid electrification through solar heating systems<lb/> (SHS) has taught a lesson that solar panels are subject to theft and vandalism. Information<lb/> campaigns and community development programmes help reduce vandalism.<lb/></p>

			<head>Poor perception of renewable energy<lb/></head>

			<p>Further, there is a perception that solar energy is not &quot; real &quot; energy; and SHSs are viewed as a<lb/> temporary solution until the grid can be extended. Some municipalities have begun to install SWH<lb/> in an effort to prevent load shedding. These efforts are seen to contribute positively to securing<lb/> sufficient electricity on the grid and to change the perception that renewable energy is not &quot; real &quot;<lb/> electricity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Electricity losses<lb/></head>

			<p>Total electricity losses other than technical vary from between 10% and 15%, which includes system<lb/> losses and theft (<ref type="biblio">Seshotlho, 2009; Madzhie, 2009</ref>). Bypassing of meters is frequent by tapping at the<lb/> supply points, and is generally well organised by groups of individuals &quot; assisting &quot; members of the<lb/> local community, usually for a nominal fee. Law enforcement is applied, but illegal reconnections<lb/> occur with minimum delay, often at the request of the households concerned. The reasons<lb/> variously cited are inability to pay for supply, or the &quot; entitlement &quot; to a basic right enshrined in the<lb/> Constitution. Cable theft is a national problem and there is no evidence to support that rural areas<lb/> or poor areas are more subject to cable theft than other areas (<ref type="biblio">Seshotlho, 2009</ref>). Eskom runs<lb/> regular campaigns to report cable theft, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and<lb/> municipalities to detect and avert theft. Despite the national power generation shortage, a number<lb/> of municipalities use 24-hour street lighting as an early warning system of supply interruptions due<lb/> to cable fault or theft.<lb/></p>

			<head>Prepaid electricity meters<lb/></head>

			<p>Prepaid electricity meters form part of the installation for all new connections under the INEP<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Smuts, 2007</ref>). Initially, their introduction aimed at displacing &quot; conventional &quot; credit meters in order<lb/> to reduce the administrative costs associated with monthly readings and billings. Further, credit<lb/> meters were generally mounted on external walls of dwellings (in all residential areas), and<lb/> suspicion was widespread that supply was accessed by unauthorised users. Hence, prepaid meters,<lb/> mounted inside dwellings, offered security while also affording the opportunity for consumers to<lb/> monitor the consumption of the appliances they use. These meters also reduced the problem of<lb/> non-payment. When selling prepaid electricity, the challenge of providing a convenient payment<lb/> point close to every home can easily be underestimated. In most instances, the change from credit<lb/> meters to prepaid meters was started with a focus on the installation of meters, but it was soon<lb/> found that the system only started to operate smoothly once the focus included the sales channel<lb/> as well. From an end-user&apos;s perspective, the real delivery process has much more to do with the<lb/> logistics of moving vouchers (sometimes called &quot; tokens &quot; or &quot; PINs &quot; ) from a computer where they are<lb/> generated, to the user&apos;s home and moving the cash from the user&apos;s pockets to the utility&apos;s bank<lb/> account. However, in the disadvantaged communities targeted by the INEP, few residents have<lb/> bank accounts. They receive their salaries in cash (often daily or weekly) and when they purchase<lb/> electricity they do frequent (once a week) small (about ZAR 30) transactions and pay in cash. In<lb/> most municipalities, this group forms the bulk of the clients. Since either a mechanism (such as an<lb/> unattended vending machine) or a person is needed to collect the cash during the transaction, this<lb/> also forms the most challenging part of the community to sell to. However, as long as there is cell<lb/> phone reception, cell phone vending has few boundaries and can reach informal settlements and<lb/> newly developed suburbs with very little infrastructure.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implementation capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>A major challenge in South Africa is lack of human technical capacity and accurate information from<lb/> the municipalities. The problem relates to all aspects of electricity markets: number of customers,<lb/> monitoring of losses, collection of revenue and also information about the number of schools and<lb/> their electrification status. This is a major reason why school electrification has not yet been<lb/> completed. Some municipalities have weak institutions and have constrained capacities to provide<lb/> basic information, thus failing to receive the necessary attention. In very special cases the DoE has<lb/> allocated funds to build up capacity to manage the electricity supply and collection of revenues.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.6 Rural electrification progress assessment and conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The South African national electrification programme has shown impressive results. The<lb/> electrification rate has increased from 30% in 1993 to 73% in 2008 (Department of <ref type="biblio">Energy, 2008a</ref>).<lb/> Ambitious plans are in place to achieve full national access to modern energy, mainly through<lb/> provision of connection to the national grid by 2014. Policies and funds are also allocated to ensure<lb/> that areas or individual houses that cannot be connected to the grid can be serviced through<lb/> different means of modern energy applications such as solar PV.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cost per connection in 2008 was on average around USD 1 000. The costs vary depending on<lb/> population density and terrain but the average cost is kept within the planned budgets.<lb/> The DoE is responsible for managing the INEP. The programme is carried out through grid<lb/> connections by Eskom and those municipalities that have been licensed to roll out electrification,<lb/> while non-grid electrification is provided by concessionaires.<lb/> The DoE monitors the implementation through field checks and similar direct follow-ups and<lb/> initiates corrective measures when results are not as planned. But there has been an<lb/> implementation deficit at the DoE because of insufficient capacity and poor co-ordination between<lb/> the non-grid component of INEP and the Renewable Energy Directorate, which is impeding the<lb/> efficiency of the Department.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several reasons why completion of the national electrification programme has had to be<lb/> postponed from 2012 to 2014.<lb/> Household electrification − the main component of the INEP − is under pressure. A major challenge<lb/> in the household electrification programme is a severe housing backlog. It is estimated that around<lb/> 1.7 million households (half the estimated total of non-electrified households in May 2009) live in<lb/> informal settlements. This means that their dwellings are built illegally and are not classified as<lb/> &quot; houses &quot; because of their unsatisfactory construction. Although households in these informal<lb/> settlements are entitled to equal access to electricity, it would not be cost-effective to electrify a<lb/> shack dwelling that may be demolished at any time or destroyed in the next rainstorm. Hence, it is a<lb/> key government priority that the issues around the 1.7 million households living in informal<lb/> settlements be addressed first (by their respective municipal councils): either the areas must be<lb/> formalised, or the inhabitants must be moved to other formalised human settlements before they<lb/> can be included in the INEP. The DoE&apos;s policy guideline addresses this matter, and a plan and its<lb/> budget are in place to enable connection before 2014 if the Department of Housing or the<lb/> municipality arrange for people to live in formalised housing.<lb/></p>

			<p>A second challenge is the municipalities&apos; capacity to deliver and oversee delivery of quality<lb/> electrification. The DoE, which is also facing capacity deficits, seeks to monitor actual performance<lb/> and to make sure that corrective measures are taken in case of under-or non-performance. Under-<lb/>or non-performance occurs in those licensed municipalities whose officials are inexperienced in the<lb/> rolling-out of grid connections. Instead of contracting nationally well-established service providers<lb/> for the physical implementation of electrification schemes, municipality officials may succumb to<lb/> pressure by the local communities to support local contractors. The combination of local pressure,<lb/> weak technical know-how, and stretched municipal capacity in general leads to delays in the<lb/> implementation or in failure to meet quality criteria. Corrective measures are then required before<lb/> the DoE releases more funds. In order to accelerate implementation and quality delivery, the DoE<lb/> has established guidelines for all the stages of the electrification programme and occasionally<lb/> provides one-off capacity building support to weaker municipalities. In the case of non-grid<lb/> electrification, non-acceptance of renewable energy systems as a solution for the provision of<lb/> electricity is slowing down the electrification process.<lb/> Electrification of registered clinics has been successfully completed ahead of schedule.<lb/> Electrification of schools, however, is facing problems largely stemming from lack of information<lb/> about the number of schools and their electrification status. Some municipalities fail to report the<lb/> number of schools in their area or fail to provide accurate information on whether the schools are<lb/> electrified or not. It is clear that this poses a major constraint for the entities in charge of the<lb/> electrification of the as-yet un-electrified schools. The lack of proper information is indeed one of<lb/> the many capacity shortfalls at municipality level. Other capacity gaps are improper recording of<lb/> sales of electricity leading to sub-optimal income streams, and sub-optimal network maintenance.<lb/> Both the DoE and the National Energy Regulator (NERSA) recognise these challenges and, in very<lb/> special cases, the DoE has allocated funds to build up capacity to manage electricity supply and the<lb/> collection of</p>

			<table>revenues.<lb/> An important by-product of the INEP is the adoption of standard methodologies, coupled with a<lb/> greater awareness of technology options. The standards were established after broad stakeholder<lb/> consultations, including electricity utility practitioners, equipment suppliers, regulatory bodies and<lb/> end-user representatives. These standards are now widely used not only in South Africa but also<lb/> throughout the Southern African region. The INEP provides incentives for a range of new<lb/> technologies, including planning tools, to meet a variety of site-specific conditions during the roll-<lb/>out of the programme.<lb/> In the case of South Africa&apos;s electrification programme the policy of &quot; inventing &quot; technologies<lb/> specifically for the poor has not been successful. If solar water heating had been used by the richer<lb/> households and in the cities, then the technology could have been extended to the poorer<lb/> communities. The rapid flow of information has determined electrification preferences of the<lb/> people. Cities have been electrified through grid extension. Renewable energy is publicly called<lb/> &quot; rural energy &quot; , and this has led to the negative image attached to all renewable energy applications.<lb/> The implementation of the DoE programme for renewable energy has been slow and the share of<lb/> renewable energy in power supply is still insignificant. In 2008, Eskom launched a programme to<lb/> subsidise solar water heating (SWH), but the subsidy level was too low and required massive<lb/> administration and control systems so that the programme has had little success. Since 2008 some<lb/> municipalities have introduced SWH as a way of avoiding load shedding by Eskom. In early 2009<lb/> South Africa announced a feed-in tariff for grid-connected renewable energy.<lb/></table>

			<p>Finally, the South African example confirms what some documentation has revealed: that rural<lb/> electrification in itself does not lead to economic growth or business development. Rural<lb/> electrification does not generate local jobs – except those jobs created for the implementation of<lb/> the electrification schemes. This was confirmed by the Socio-Economic Surveys undertaken by the<lb/> DoE. Rural economic development needs more than just household electrification. Constraints on<lb/> the availability of energy and its affordability affect economic development, especially in rural<lb/> areas. Modern energy services promote economic development by enhancing the productivity of<lb/> labour and capital. There are important development benefits to be gained from expanding access<lb/> to modern energy services. In order to achieve rural development objectives, however, there needs<lb/> to be an integrated approach to the provision of modern energy services and improved information<lb/> and telecommunication, education, health and transport services. The long-term effect on the<lb/> population of smoke-free kitchens, and the benefits of being able to read in the evening, watch<lb/> television, or charge a cell-phone will be interesting to follow. In the case of South Africa, the<lb/> national electrification plan is an integral part of a broader national development plan. Other<lb/> initiatives are in place to promote growth and job creation, such as through the development of<lb/> tourism. Electrifying a new area will open many doors to take advantage of the parallel government<lb/> initiatives to stimulate economic growth. These initiatives will have more success if they include<lb/> energy access in their overall objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 Conclusions and recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>The detailed country profiles for Brazil, China, India and South Africa shed light on the main issues<lb/> that arose as their governments shaped and implemented their rural electrification strategies.<lb/> These profiles have also served to show successful examples in overcoming major challenges.<lb/></p>

			<p>The keys to the successful setting-up and implementation of rural electrification policies are drawn<lb/> from these profiles. Their aim is to encourage policy makers in developing countries who strive to<lb/> attain the same goals to take time during the electrification process to consider collaborating with<lb/> one another and within the various IEA energy technology Implementing Agreements or Working<lb/> Parties.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Preconditions to successful rural electrification measures<lb/> 5.1.1 Sound statistical data to map out the populations&apos; geographical<lb/> distribution and electrification status<lb/></head>

			<p>A prerequisite to any rural electrification policy is the collection of sound statistical data to map out<lb/> the electrification needs of a country. The shaping of the policy (including the choice of technologies<lb/> for electrification and deadlines) will greatly depend on the geographical distribution of the rural<lb/> population and of the existing grid, the density of this population and its level of electrification.<lb/> First, lack of information about the location of populations without access to electricity will cause<lb/> serious delays in the implementation of an electrification policy not to mention the risk of<lb/> overlooking small-scale infrastructures (isolated schools, health centres, etc.) or remote<lb/> communities unable to inform about their needs because of their geographical distance. Secondly,<lb/> the choice of the suitable technology for electrification can only be done efficiently when targets<lb/> are clearly defined, such as the expected use of electricity and particularly its productive use<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2 Sustained government support and long-term commitment of<lb/> funds<lb/></head>

			<p>Page | 100<lb/> A successful rural electrification programme needs long-term strategic planning and financial<lb/> resources for its implementation and for long-term maintenance and repairs. Before 2007, lack of<lb/> sufficient funds was the main reason for the slow implementation of rural electrification in India<lb/> during the 10 th Five-Year Plan. Moreover, if secure and dedicated funds are not available for the<lb/> longer term once the project is implemented, there will be financial losses and perhaps the de-<lb/>electrification of previously newly electrified villages. This has occurred in China, where &quot; system<lb/> integrators &quot; were responsible for the maintenance of their stand-alone systems for only three years<lb/> after installation. This resulted in some systems being abandoned because of lack of ownership and<lb/> funds for repairs and maintenance. Such funds need to be included in the electrification plan and<lb/> made available over a longer period, say 5 to 10 years after installation. Whether these funds are<lb/> provided through subsidies or through loans, governments should aim at the maximum level of<lb/> certainty concerning the long-term commitment. Available funds should be &quot; ring-fenced &quot; so that<lb/> there is no risk of having them misdirected to other government-led activities (GNESD, 2006).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.3 Dedicated institutional structures and independence from political<lb/> agendas<lb/></head>

			<p>The creation of transparent and dedicated institutions such as rural electrification agencies (or co-<lb/>ordinating agencies) and/or a rural electrification fund, largely autonomous and responsible for<lb/> implementing the country&apos;s rural electrification strategy, is strongly recommended (<ref type="biblio">Barnes &amp; Foley,<lb/> 2004</ref>). Such agencies ensure that funds are allocated directly to rural electrification and not<lb/> reallocated over time to various national priorities. Their apolitical nature should guarantee the<lb/> durability of efforts independently of any other political or social goal. They should also develop the<lb/> necessary standards and guidelines for the implementation of rural electrification programmes. For<lb/> example, the establishment of the Rural Electrification Board in India has proven to be an effective<lb/> means of furthering electrification efforts independently of political pressures.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the same vein, it is also essential that rural electrification efforts remain independent from<lb/> politicians&apos; personal agendas. Not uncommon are cases where politicians, eager to gain their<lb/> constituents&apos; support for a renewed mandate, interfere with the electrification process. This has<lb/> occurred in Bangladesh, where one village, and no other, was provided with access to electricity for<lb/> the satisfaction of politicians&apos; agendas. The government of Bangladesh has also pledged to<lb/> construct new lines servicing areas in the constituencies (whose selection was not justified on<lb/> commercial grounds) of all Members of Parliament (<ref type="biblio">Taniguchi &amp; Kaneko, 2009</ref>). The consequences<lb/> of such administrative corruption are well known, and hinder the development process. When<lb/> political pressures interfere with the distribution planning, they cause financial difficulties to the<lb/> utilities or distribution companies if they are forced to operate in a non-commercial manner or are<lb/> unable to cut the power supply to non-paying customers. For this reason, rural electrification<lb/> efforts should follow a predetermined, inviolable plan that involves a structured institutional<lb/> setting. An apolitical monitoring of how rural electrification progresses is recommended. This task<lb/> can be undertaken by independent institutions created or designated for that purpose.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.4 Establishment of a strong market infrastructure to attract private<lb/> investors<lb/></head>

			<p>Participation of the private sector is important when electrifying remote villages, particularly with<lb/> stand-alone systems. But for the private sector to participate, governments must ensure the<lb/> Page | 101<lb/> existence of a secure market infrastructure, as all electrification projects need to be viable in order<lb/> to be sustainable. And as the private sector&apos;s viability depends on profits, it will participate in the<lb/> electrification process only if money flows easily from customer to supplier. As a market in<lb/> transition, China has tried to encourage private-sector involvement in the electrification process of<lb/> rural areas through stand-alone systems (although the boundary between privately owned and<lb/> publicly owned enterprises is not always clear). In cases where revenues are too insecure to attract<lb/> the private sector, governments could grant subsidies to enterprises that wish to engage in rural<lb/> electrification programmes. Such policy however has had mixed results (<ref type="biblio">Martinot et al., 2000</ref>) and<lb/> should only be a transitional incentive to encourage private engagement.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.5 Related laws and/or regulations to be carried out alongside the<lb/> electrification process<lb/></head>

			<p>First, measures including complementary economic development programmes, alongside the<lb/> provision of electricity in rural areas, should be introduced to foster business. These measures<lb/> should ensure that rural areas are governed by good rural markets and have access to credit<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Barnes, 2007</ref>). Without such complementary measures, business development initiated by the<lb/> electrification process is likely to slacken. Joint efforts with other ministries or development<lb/> agencies are therefore recommended to enhance the economic benefits of electrification, as Brazil<lb/> has done. Through its Territories of Citizenship Programme, a joint ministerial effort to promote<lb/> economic growth through territorial development, Brazil is in fact striving to improve the quality of<lb/> life of households in rural or poorer regions.<lb/> Secondly, in parallel to the electrification process, the implementation of energy efficiency policies<lb/> or measures is recommended. Energy efficiency measures such as the use of energy-saving<lb/> appliances, simple demand-side management measures, or energy conservation in buildings,<lb/> significantly reduce electricity demand. The Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for example<lb/> has taken many energy conservation measures to control electricity consumption in parallel to the<lb/> country&apos;s electrification efforts. But this was not the case in South Africa, where energy efficiency<lb/> measures were launched only after the 2008 blackouts, during which it appeared that South Africa<lb/> could not meet its growing demand for electricity. In fact, during South Africa&apos;s electrification<lb/> efforts, energy efficiency measures were largely overlooked. The government, aware of the need<lb/> for energy efficiency measures, is now working to ensure that all houses comply with best-practice<lb/> energy efficiency standards. This late compliance, however, has had costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.6 Electricity affordability<lb/></head>

			<p>The issue of electricity affordability is recurrent in the context of rural electrification, as the target<lb/> groups are usually the rural poor. This said, rural households are usually very willing to pay for<lb/> access to energy services. When they do not have access to electricity, they often contribute much<lb/> of their time and revenue to buying or collecting energy sources for their day-to-day needs (<ref type="biblio">Barnes,<lb/> 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The first hurdle is the connection. Initial payments for the connection are often high for the rural<lb/> poor. They may have enough to pay for the regular use of electricity but may not be able to afford<lb/> the connection fees. In such cases, any subsidised electricity is useless for them. When connections<lb/> are free of charge for the very poor, as in South Africa and India, this first problem is tackled. If<lb/> funds are not available, spreading the connection costs over several years will enable larger<lb/> numbers of customers to be wired, while ensuring the costs are recovered over time by the utility.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second hurdle is setting the tariff. There is no made-to-measure tariff and there is no good way<lb/> to set tariffs. Three points however need to be raised. First, there is a widespread belief that, to<lb/> benefit the rural poor, electricity needs to be sold at a very low price; facts often prove the<lb/> contrary. In reality, richer communities will benefit more than the poorer ones since they can afford<lb/> to buy electric appliances, which the very poor cannot. In addition, subsidies should be designed in<lb/> such a way that only the poorest segments of society benefit from them, and not the better-off<lb/> communities. Secondly, if the &quot; natural &quot; price is charged, the electricity supplier will be able to<lb/> effectively and sustainably supply electricity while making a profit that will ensure the sustainability<lb/> of the electrification process (<ref type="biblio">Barnes &amp; Foley, 2004</ref>). Thirdly, rural households are often able to pay<lb/> for their electricity consumption.<lb/> Involving these communities in the tariff-setting process will secure better and more adequate tariff<lb/> systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.7 Effective metering, billing and payment recovery<lb/></head>

			<p>The effective recovery of customer payments allows electricity companies to supply reliable and<lb/> sustainable power. Lack of payment for electricity use not only weakens the financial stability of the<lb/> electricity provider (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2000</ref>), but also discourages investors to join in on the rural<lb/> electrification efforts because of uncertain revenues. Adequate metering, billing and payment<lb/> recovery are fundamental to a sustainable electrification system. When meters do not function<lb/> correctly, are not properly read or billing is incorrect, then the customer&apos;s actual consumption will<lb/> not be paid for. Adding to these technical or organisational challenges is petty corruption at the<lb/> interface with customers, including bribes paid to or requested by meter readers. To tackle these<lb/> issues, measures such as the creation of franchisees (India), the part-time recruitment of farmers<lb/> for meter reading (China), or the use of prepaid meters (South Africa and Brazil) as well as stricter<lb/> management rules (such as random controls) all help to improve the recovery of customer<lb/> payment, a necessary condition for successful rural electrification efforts.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.8 Full involvement of the rural community throughout the decision-<lb/>making process<lb/></head>

			<p>Involving rural communities in the decision-making process has substantially contributed to the<lb/> effectiveness of these electrification programmes. One tends to believe that rural electrification is<lb/> the outcome of the sole efforts of governments (central, local or regional) and/or of international<lb/> development or funding agencies. But the involvement of rural communities in the process,<lb/> particularly their participation in decision-making committees, has added value to the planning<lb/> process and given the communities a sense of ownership of the process. Because of their intrinsic<lb/> characteristics, rural community workers have invaluable knowledge of their region&apos;s consumption<lb/> patterns, have authority to educate consumers in how to use electricity, can support the utilities in<lb/> encouraging customers to connect and in training in the use of energy efficiency measures, etc.<lb/> Both India and Brazil have taken this into account. India, acknowledging that most of the burden of<lb/> doing without electricity falls on women, has arranged for women to be represented in District<lb/> Committees, thereby helping in the co-ordination and control of electrification extensions within<lb/> their district. These committees also check the quality of power and consumer satisfaction, and<lb/> promote energy efficiency measures. According to the government of India&apos;s statement, the<lb/> &quot; participation of women in meeting energy needs, especially electricity, is essential for effective,<lb/> efficient and sustainable implementation of rural electrification programs. &quot; Similarly, Brazil through<lb/> its Luz para Todos programme has ensured the involvement of rural communities in Management<lb/> Committees which work to prioritise activities within the electrification process.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Stand-alone systems: conditions for successful rural<lb/> electrification efforts<lb/></head>

			<p>Different issues need to be addressed to secure the sustainability of the electrification process<lb/> through stand-alone systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.1 Locally produced and resource-specific technologies for<lb/> electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>If grid extension is not chosen to electrify a targeted region, then the choice of a stand-alone system<lb/> − whether small, mini or micro-hydro, PV systems, wind energy, hybrid systems, diesel generators,<lb/> etc. − will depend on many factors. No single technology is to be recommended. Aspects such as<lb/> the geographical dispersion of the local population, the community&apos;s estimated electricity needs<lb/> and ability to pay, availability of local resources, all factor into the decision-making process. Also,<lb/> long-term investment from the private sector depends on the climate profile of the territory; the<lb/> private sector will invest in the safest places as regards climate impacts and will favour climate<lb/> change-resilient regions. Therefore, decisions will be region-specific, resource-specific, technology-<lb/>specific (hydro plants in water-rich regions and PV systems in sunny regions, as is the case in China).<lb/> Rural electrification programmes will also favour locally-manufactured technologies to reduce<lb/> transportation or import costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.2 Management and maintenance require adequate training,<lb/> guaranteed assistance structures and customer-supply chains<lb/></head>

			<p>Once systems are installed and the electricity service is provided, it is important to make sure that<lb/> the rural communities – or the actors responsible – are sufficiently skilled to operate and maintain<lb/> the systems. Lack of any basic skills (including the ability to read the maintenance handbook) may<lb/> lead to the system being abandoned in case of malfunctioning. It is therefore essential that<lb/> adequate training be provided to the maintenance actor while the stand-alone system is being<lb/> installed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, accessible guaranteed assistance structures in support of maintenance and repair should<lb/> be established at the outset of the electrification effort. It is recommended that the target<lb/> communities − or the responsible maintenance actors − be informed by the installer of how to<lb/> contact assistance structures. Without such assistance structures and guidelines, there is a risk that<lb/> the system be abandoned in the longer run.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, just as clear assistance structures are a necessary condition for the sustainability of stand-<lb/>alone systems in remote areas, it is recommended that maintenance actors should be given clear<lb/> guidelines as to where and how to obtain spare parts and maintenance materials. In addition,<lb/> governments should ensure that suppliers are committed to provide adequate after-sales services.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.3 Sufficient long-term financing to ensure system maintenance<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial provision should be made at the outset for the long-term maintenance of the systems. To<lb/> ensure projects&apos; sustainability, financial support (whether through loans, subsidies or other) should<lb/> be provided for the installation of stand-alone systems and long-term (5 to 10 year) annual<lb/> contracts for the maintenance and upgrading of the systems so as to prevent any system failure. In<lb/> addition, electricity supply can be partially directed towards the development of productive<lb/> activities to generate funds and so to cover the costs incurred by power supply, operation and<lb/> maintenance, particularly once the annual maintenance contract has come to an end.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.4 Dealing with the misconception that stand-alone systems provide<lb/> &quot; second-class &quot; electricity<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity supplied through stand-alone systems is not to be regarded as &quot; second class &quot; provision, a<lb/> problem that is currently observed in South Africa. Appropriate information dissemination and good<lb/> performance of the stand-alone systems will do away with such issues as lack of ownership, and<lb/> long-term deterioration or abandonment of the systems will be avoided. Decision makers are to rely<lb/> on the members of the rural communities sitting in the various supporting committees to redress<lb/> this misconception within their communities.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3 Grid extension: conditions for successful rural<lb/> electrification efforts<lb/> 5.3.1 Reducing transmission and distribution losses<lb/></head>

			<p>Long transmission lines (when extending the grid to rural areas) are at risk of high transmission and<lb/> distribution (T&amp;D) losses. Line quality and the quality of transformers will also impact the efficiency<lb/> of T&amp;D. Regular maintenance and upgrading of power lines and transformers will significantly<lb/> reduce such losses.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.2 Reducing losses from electricity theft<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity theft occurs through many different channels. Meters are tampered, or meter readers<lb/> are corrupt, billing is inadequate or non-existent, revenue is not collected or is not passed on to the<lb/> utility. Electricity theft can also take the form of illegal hookings (a small metal hook is slung to an<lb/> overhead power cable and then linked to a house through a cable) which are difficult to prevent or<lb/> control. All these losses add up and electricity companies are seriously weakened when their service<lb/> is not paid for. Although theft takes place just as often in urban centres as in rural areas, measures<lb/> to control and reduce electricity theft are more difficult to apply in rural areas. The introduction of<lb/> India&apos;s 2003 Electricity Act, a law in which theft is considered a criminal offence heavily penalised,<lb/> dissuades electricity thieves. Other means are the installation of high-voltage distribution systems<lb/> Page | 105<lb/> (HVDS) which are difficult to hook cables on to. In the case of stand-alone systems in China, PV<lb/> modules have in some instances been welded to the main structure to create additional hindrances<lb/> for potential thieves. In South Africa, Eskom, the national power utility, runs regular campaigns for<lb/> cable theft to be reported, and security patrols are used by both Eskom and municipalities to detect<lb/> and avert theft.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.3 Use of low-cost technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>Through the use of low-cost technologies such as single-wire earth return (SWER) as currently used<lb/> in South Africa for the electrification of rural households, costs of electrification remain controlled.<lb/> Other standards that allow for cost-effectiveness are the adequate location of transformers, which<lb/> could depend on current assessed and future electricity demand (GNESD, 2006). Such standards will<lb/> contribute to moderate electricity prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4 Three rural electrification boosters<lb/> 5.4.1 Social fairness can be one of the initial driving motivators in the<lb/> first stages of electrification<lb/></head>

			<p>A 2009 case study of Bangladesh showed that the total income gain following electrification<lb/> reached up to 30% (<ref type="biblio">Khandker et al., 2009</ref>). But this was not the result of directing electricity to<lb/> productive end-uses. In fact electricity provision led to a significant improvement in total study time<lb/> for children in rural households coupled with an increase in the number of completed school years.<lb/> The income generated was shown to be sustainable over as long as 8 years. These encouraging<lb/> results are real incentives to target household electrification as a means of attaining social equity<lb/> which in the long run will lead to economic growth. Indeed, considering only the productive end-<lb/>uses of electricity as useful for development is obscuring the actual proven development capacity of<lb/> health services and education (<ref type="biblio">Cabraal et al., 2005</ref>). This also may slow down the electrification<lb/> efforts. For this reason, social equity can be one of the initial driving motivators of electrification.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4.2 Minimising trial and error through benchmarking and exchange<lb/> with other countries<lb/></head>

			<p>Though not all emerging economies face the same challenges when working to expand rural<lb/> electrification, many of the challenges are similar. Whether they live in Brazil, South Africa, China or<lb/> India, or any developing country, rural populations have the same main characteristics, namely they<lb/> are often dispersed, difficult to reach, have low electricity consumption needs and low capacity to<lb/> pay. In addition, countries face the same dual choice between grid extension and stand-alone<lb/> systems (whatever their size or energy source) and also the same questions regarding the means for<lb/> financing their electrification efforts (subsidies, loans, grants or other). Often institutional structures<lb/> or regulatory frameworks need to be introduced or strengthened to encourage investors or the<lb/> private sector to participate in the electrification scheme. Given the similarity of problems, it is<lb/> recommended that countries with active rural electrification policies benchmark their activities with<lb/> those of other countries at similar or more advanced stages. Such information exchange between<lb/> countries with similar objectives should take place before and during the implementation of rural<lb/> electrification policies 52 to minimise trial and error.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4.3 Co-operation within IEA Implementing Agreements for exchange<lb/> on technologies and support on policy formulation<lb/></head>

			<p>Finally, co-operation within the framework of the IEA Implementing Agreements (IA) will provide<lb/> support to countries seeking to develop their electrification policies. IAs are collaborative<lb/> programmes whose members 53 participate in some or all of the following activities: research<lb/> projects, programmes for information exchange, policy analysis, technology assessments, feasibility<lb/> studies, environmental impact studies, market analysis, and more. Benefits of collaborating with<lb/> other countries within these programmes are &quot; reduced cost and less duplication of work, greater<lb/> project scale, information sharing and networking, linkage between IEA member countries and non-<lb/>member countries of the IEA, linkage between research and industry, accelerated development and<lb/> deployment, harmonised technical standards, strengthened national RD&amp;D capabilities &quot; (IEA, 2007).<lb/> Members of these collaborative programmes are able to influence the direction of the work of the<lb/> IAs. It is thus recommended that countries wishing to engage in rural electrification efforts consider<lb/> participating in these IAs to learn from other countries and share their experience with other<lb/> country participants. 54 A list of the relevant IAs can be found in the proceedings of the 2008<lb/> workshop on &quot; IEA Sustainable Rural Energisation in Major Emerging Economies &quot;<lb/> http://www.iea.org/textbase/work/workshopdetail.asp?WS_ID=379.</p>
