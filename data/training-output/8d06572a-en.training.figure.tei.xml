Terms and conditions were tight following the economic recession and financial institutions<lb/> managed risk by extending less financing to SMEs in general. However, terms and conditions improved for tourism<lb/> SMEs in 2011. Fewer tourism SMEs (45.3%) were required to pledge collateral in 2011 compared with other SMEs<lb/> (67.3%). In addition, SMEs in both tourism and other industries were offered lower interest rates. However, tourism<lb/> SMEs requested less financing, on average, and received less than what they requested in 2011.Tourism SMEs had<lb/> a lower total financing authorisation-to-request ratio (85.0%) than other SMEs (94.8%) in 2011, suggesting tourism<lb/> SMEs had more difficulty obtaining debt financing than other SMEs.<lb/> Source: Industry Canada (2015) www.ic.gc.ca</figDesc>

The programme has been designed by the Federal Government, the Secretariat of Energy,<lb/> the National Commission for the Efficient Use of Energy and the United Nations Development Program, with the<lb/> purpose of decreasing the environmental footprint of the tourism sector by reducing greenhouse emissions. The<lb/> programme intends to extract successful lessons from this pilot initiative, to assess the viability of expanding it<lb/> across the whole Mexican territory. The pilot project was launched in the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, and<lb/> Yucatán, providing financing support to small, medium and large hotels that are not part of hotel chains.
