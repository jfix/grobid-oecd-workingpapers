			<body>Belgium&apos;s Flemish government recently approved a EUR 1 billion investment in school infrastructure <lb/>through public-private partnerships, its first major initiative of this kind. The Flemish Community&apos;s <lb/>variant of public-private partnerships in school building allows the government to meet urgent needs <lb/>in the short run, but also to spread the costs over a longer period. <lb/>Over the past few decades, investments in school infrastructure in Flanders have not been sufficient to <lb/>meet demands. According to the latest estimates, EUR 1.9 billion are needed, of which EUR 1.4 billion <lb/>must be financed by the Flemish government in respect of European legislation, compared to the 2005 <lb/>budget for school infrastructure of only EUR 140 million. The regular budget clearly does not provide <lb/>enough funds to clear the existing backlog of necessary construction work. <lb/>The current Flemish government is allocating new funding for school building projects. The budget for <lb/>school construction is to increase by EUR 50 million in both 2006 and 2007 and by EUR 75 million in <lb/>2008 and 2009. These funds will be used for regular investments (i.e. standard government subsidies <lb/>and budgets allocated directly to schools) and will prevent the backlog from growing further. <lb/>Apart from this rise in regular investments, the Flemish government plans to eliminate the existing <lb/>backlog through alternative financing. To do so, the government will select a single consortium to be <lb/>responsible for the design, construction, financing and maintenance of all school building projects. <lb/>The consortium will consist of private financial partners (e.g. banks and insurance companies) with the <lb/>government representing 25%. The consortium will not own the buildings but will receive financial <lb/>compensation over a period of approximately 30 years in exchange for making the buildings available <lb/>to the schools. <lb/>The building projects themselves will be launched by means of separate tenders, in order to <lb/>guarantee best value for money through competition between several contractors and architects. A <lb/>special committee, representing the different stakeholder organisations in Flemish education, will be <lb/>responsible for deciding which projects are eligible for the new financing. This committee will first <lb/>define the selection criteria, paying close attention to design quality, sustainability and the role of the <lb/>school in the community. A government architect employed by the Ministry of the Flemish Community <lb/>will ensure the architectural quality of the projects. (See Figure 1.) <lb/>It is expected that there will be other advantages. All the investments will be made at nearly the same <lb/>time and by the single public-private consortium, leading to lower costs. Also as the government will <lb/>be in a stronger position to guarantee projects are carried out quickly, school boards will be relieved of <lb/>managing the building projects and will be able to fully concentrate on the provision of education. <lb/>The Flemish Minister of Work, Education and Training, Frank Vandenbroucke, expects that, from <lb/>2008 on, EUR 250 million in school building projects can be completed every year. In the meantime, <lb/>the government is working to prepare projects – establishing regulations, naming the public-private <lb/>PEB Exchange 2006/6 – ISSN 1609-7548 – © OECD 2006 <lb/>Public-Private Partnerships in Flanders <lb/>• Figure 1• <lb/> The Flemish project for design, construction, financing and maintenance: <lb/>actors and relationships<lb/>AGIOn (Flemish government) <lb/>Suppliers of services <lb/>Architect-contractor <lb/>Maintenance <lb/>Private financial partners <lb/>Public-private consortium <lb/>School <lb/>Flemish government <lb/>architect <lb/>consortium, selecting and prioritising the school building projects, developing output specifications, <lb/>etc. – together with the different stakeholders in Flemish education. <lb/>AGIOn, the new Flemish Agency for Infrastructure in Education and successor of the DIGO (former <lb/>infrastructure agency for private and communal institutions), will participate in the public-private <lb/>consortium assuming 25% of the budget and will ensure that the design, construction, financing and <lb/>maintenance initiative is correctly implemented. The agency will also be in charge of the subsidies that <lb/>will enable schools to pay the long-term financial compensation to the public-private consortium. <lb/>In difficult economic times, the investment is expected to give an important boost to the Flemish <lb/>Community&apos;s building sector. <lb/>For further information, contact: <lb/>Geert Leemans <lb/>Assistant to the Director <lb/>Agentschap voor Infrastructuur in het Onderwijs (AGIOn) <lb/>Brussels, Belgium <lb/>Tel.: 32 22 221 05 20 </body>
