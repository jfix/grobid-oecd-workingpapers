Nevertheless, continuous reallocation is a key feature of well-functioning market<lb/> economies and aggregate productivity will be improved if resources are reallocated away from less<lb/> productive to more productive businesses and activities over time. The key mechanisms through which this<lb/> process occurs are firm turnover (i.e. entry and exit), shifts in resources across incumbent firms and<lb/> resource reallocation within firms.</table>
