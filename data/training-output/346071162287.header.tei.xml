	<p type="introduction">ABSTRACT<lb/> This paper describes and assesses pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies in Canada,<lb/> considering them in the context of the broader policy and market environment in which they operate, and<lb/> investigating their role in contributing to Canada&apos;s achievements in meeting a range of objectives relating<lb/> to the pharmaceutical policy. The federal government regulates prices of patented pharmaceutical products<lb/> with the objective of protecting consumers against excessive prices. Regulation has very likely been<lb/> responsible for bringing Canada&apos;s prices for patented medicines roughly in line with European<lb/> comparators. Prices of generic products, which are not regulated, are relatively high although high<lb/> penetration of the Canadian market has been achieved. All Canadians have coverage for drugs provided in<lb/> hospitals through a publicly financed scheme that furnishes hospital and physician services free of charge<lb/> to patients. Drugs dispensed outside the hospital setting are not included among the insured benefits<lb/> guaranteed by the Canadian Health Act. Consequently, two-thirds of the Canadian population, including<lb/> most employees and their families, obtains such coverage through private health insurance, while most<lb/> senior citizens, together with designated groups of vulnerable populations, are covered by provincial,<lb/> territorial or federal plans. In most cases, patients share in the costs of reimbursed medicines through co-<lb/>payments or co-insurance, sometimes after meeting a deductible. The lack of protection against the risk of<lb/> catastrophic out-of-pocket spending for drugs remains an issue for a small part of the Canadian population,<lb/> concentrated in the Atlantic Provinces. Reflecting these coverage and reimbursement arrangements, 54%<lb/> of drug expenditures are financed by private insurances and households. Drug expenditures have been<lb/> increasing very rapidly in recent years. Formulary management, now facilitated by a government initiative<lb/> to undertake common drug reviews, and the promotion of generic substitution have been the main levers<lb/> used by public plans to improve the efficiency of drug expenditures. Private plans have historically<lb/> covered all medicines authorised for sale in Canada, although this is changing in light of cost pressure.<lb/> Overall, new drugs are available in the Canadian market on a timely basis, but maintaining comprehensive<lb/> availability and accessibility may be an emerging challenge.<lb/> JEL Classification: I18, I11<lb/></p>
