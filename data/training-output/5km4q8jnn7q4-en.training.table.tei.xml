Greenhouse gas emissions from transport depend on transport volumes and on the<lb/> carbon-intensity of the various technologies used. Section 3 discusses how technologies in a number<lb/> of key market segments could evolve. Here, we ask how demand for transport might develop. Various<lb/> institutions publish global projections for transport demand with a 2030 or 2050 horizon, see e.g. IEA<lb/> (2009), ITF (2009), Exxon (2009). These projections are based on partial models of the transport</table>

According to the same exercise, the share of OECD countries in total transport emissions is<lb/> about 60% in 2010, declining to 45% in 2030 and 35% in 2050. The share of light-duty vehicle<lb/> emissions in the total is expected to decline from 42% in 2010 to 36% in 2030 and in 2050. The share<lb/> of aviation is set to grow, from 15% in 2010 to 22% in 2030 and in 2050.<lb/> These expectations are clearly not compatible with ambitious climate change mitigation<lb/> objectives, and the underlying transport volume growth also raises challenges in terms of other<lb/> transport related externalities, including noise, traffic safety, conventional air pollution and congestion.<lb/> The continuing trend towards urbanization and the particularly fast growth of the number of<lb/> megacities 2 further stresses the need to address local pollution and congestion problems.</table>

            <table>The present market shares of different modes differ strongly across countries. In 2005, private<lb/> passenger cars had a market share, in terms of passenger kilometre, of less than 20% in China and India<lb/> (IEA, 2009, p. 50). The other passenger kilometres were taken care of by minibuses, busses, rail and air.<lb/> In OECD Europe, cars account for 65% of total volume, bus and rail 15% and air about 15% as well. In<lb/> North America, cars take account of approximately 80%, bus and rail 5% and 15% is air transport (IEA<lb/> 2009). Congestion and air pollution problems are more acute in urban areas. Urban transport is a small<lb/> share of overall passenger transport (about 20 %) and also for urban transport modal shares are very<lb/> different across countries. One of the striking differences is the much higher share of busses and rail in<lb/> OECD Europe, China and India compared to many North-American cities.<lb/> 14<lb/> Proost, Van Dender — Discussion Paper 2010-14</table>

            <table>implies an equally strong causal connection in the sense<lb/> of higher density reducing travel distance; for a detailed review, see NRC, 2009. Work using<lb/> disaggregated data shows that this causal link exists but is not as strong as it appears at first sight. The<lb/> reason is that households sort into particular locations on the basis of their preferences (captured through<lb/> observed and non-observed characteristics), and those preferences partially explain transport choices<lb/> rather than density alone. The result is that no major reductions in transport volumes or energy consumption should be expected unless truly drastic changes in land-use are brought about (Bento et al.,<lb/> 2005, Brownstone and Golob, 2009). Brownstone and Golob (2009) find that, for two Californian<lb/> households that are otherwise identical in observed characteristics, a difference in residential density of<lb/> 1,000 housing units per square mile (40% of the sample mean) leads to 1,171 fewer miles driven and 64.7<lb/> less gallons of gasoline consumed per year; this is 4.7% and 5.5% of the sample mean, respectively. Of<lb/> the change in gasoline consumption, about 2/3 is due to less driving and 1/3 to the fact that households in<lb/> denser areas tend to own more fuel-efficient vehicles. Changing driving and energy consumption by about<lb/> 5% of course is not negligible, but it is highly doubtful that changing density by 40% is feasible in all but a<lb/> limited number of circumstances.
