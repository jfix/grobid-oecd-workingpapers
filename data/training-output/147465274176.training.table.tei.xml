Due to Dalian&apos;s<lb/> geographical proximity and historical links to neighbouring Japan and Korea, the region has a substantial Japanese<lb/> and Korean speaking population, which can be employed to supply voice-based and non-voice-based business<lb/> process services. It also hosts many universities and research institutes that provide plenty of graduates that form<lb/> the backbone in the outsourcing sector.<lb/> Exports have grown rapidly: after the first establishments of mostly domestic companies, Panasonic setup<lb/> operations in 2001 as the first Japanese multinational and GE Capital International Services arrived the following<lb/> year. In September 2006, 340 companies employed approximately 30,000 professionals in the DLSP and roughly<lb/> 40 percent of the companies were foreign-owned. Half of the companies supply BPS and ITS services to foreign<lb/> clients mainly in East Asia and Japan captures some 80 percent of exports. Revenue is to a large extent made up of<lb/> software application development (40 percent) and business process services (30 percent). Engineering services,<lb/> embedded software and R&amp;D make up much the rest. A joint venture between DLSP and a Singaporean company<lb/> is currently investing to develop the park by adding 9 km² to the current 3 km², which will make it the largest<lb/> software park in China. This project is to form an industrial arrangement enclosing a Software Development Zone,<lb/> a Research &amp; Development Zone, an Information Service Zone, an Education &amp; Training Zone, and a Corporate<lb/> Campus Zone, plus adjacent public services and housing.<lb/> DLSP offers companies a set of preferential policies. Foreign companies that operate in the DLSP can enjoy<lb/> preferential tax treatment during five years from the year the company starts making a profit: the taxes of the first 2<lb/> years are exempted and taxes for the following 3 years are reduced by 50 percent. Moreover, as long as exports<lb/> make up at least 70 percent of total production value, income tax is reduced from 33 percent to 10 percent and the<lb/> maximum VAT from 17 percent to 0-3 percent. For software products, VAT and export tax are exempted. For<lb/> technology exports, the sales tax and income tax are exempted. Companies that export software products for more<lb/> than US$ 1 million can conduct trade operations without having to make use of a third party export/import agent.<lb/> Furthermore, import tax and VAT are exempted for imported equipment used by software companies and for<lb/> technology, including software, and the parts and spare parts imported together with the equipment (with some<lb/> exceptions).</table>
