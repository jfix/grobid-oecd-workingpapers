	<titlePart>The euro changeover in the Slovak Republic: implications for inflation and interest rates<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<p type="introduction">In January 2009, the Slovak Republic will adopt the euro and become the 16 th member of the euro area. This<lb/> paper investigates the implications of euro adoption in the Slovak Republic for inflation and interest rates with an<lb/> attempt to quantify their likely size as well as their consequences for the general public. The empirical analysis –<lb/> which makes use of the experience of the first-wave euro area countries – suggests that the cash changeover will<lb/> most likely be associated with a moderate increase in consumer prices, estimated at around 0.3%. Policy measures to<lb/> reduce this effect include public information campaigns, the conversion of publicly administered prices with the exact<lb/> conversion rate and the reduction of administrative obstacles to increase supply. The minor purchasing power losses<lb/> associated with this price increase will not be evenly distributed across the population with higher income households<lb/> and families with children expected to be harder hit than others. Even though the exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro area<lb/> will be irrevocably fixed, past appreciations of the koruna are still likely to pass-through to some downward pressure<lb/> on consumer prices, with the cumulative effect estimated to amount to around 1.5% up to mid-2009. In the longer<lb/> run, the Balassa-Samuelson effect and other factors affecting catch-up economies may raise the Slovak inflation rate<lb/> above the euro area level. As capital markets have already fully priced in euro membership, no immediate effect on<lb/> short-and long-term interest rates in the wholesale markets is to be expected for January 2009. In the longer run, euro<lb/> adoption can be expected to foster financial integration, thereby leading to a convergence of Slovak retail interest<lb/> rates towards euro area levels. This reduction in retail interest rates will benefit the general public with mortgage<lb/> borrowers likely to reap the largest benefits. A potential risk of low real interest rates is the emergence of a boom-bust<lb/> cycle; prudent fiscal policy and further structural reforms, including enhanced competition, would help to counter any<lb/> such developments.<lb/> JEL classification: F36; E31; E43<lb/></p>
