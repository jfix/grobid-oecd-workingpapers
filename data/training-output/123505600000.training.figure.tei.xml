            <figDesc>ABSTRACT/RÉSUMÉ<lb/> COLLECTIVE PENSION FUNDS – INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE AND<lb/> IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA&apos;S ENTERPRISE ANNUITIES REFORM</figDesc>
        </figure>


        <figure>

            <figDesc>concept of occupational pensions (referred to as Enterprise Annuities – EA -in China) was<lb/> first introduced to the Chinese pension system in late 1990 when the Chinese authorities started to<lb/> implement the multi-pillar model recommended by the World Bank. After over 10 years of<lb/> development, many enterprises across the country have established complementary pension plans<lb/> on a voluntary basis. Most of these funds were set up before the Enterprise Annuity legislation of<lb/> 2004 was passed. Such funds are generally known as ―legacy EAs‖. Some, new EAs have also<lb/> been established under the new 2004 legislation. Currently, the ―legacy EA‖ market in China<lb/> comprises four players, namely:<lb/> a) The EA Administration Centres, which were purposely established to administer and manage<lb/> pension funds accumulated in a particular region. The most notable two are the Shanghai EA<lb/> Administration Centre and Shenzhen Administration Centre. These EA Administration Centres,<lb/> are de facto part of the local social security bureaus. As of 2006, the Shanghai EA Administration<lb/> Centre accumulated over RMB 10 billion of pension assets, while it was RMB 2.3 billion for the<lb/> Shenzhen Administration Centre.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In total, the EA schemes – currently primarily established by profitable enterprises/industries in<lb/> China – have accumulated RMB 91 billion assets 6 as of 2006 (75 billion of which are ‗legacy<lb/> funds&apos; held by EAs established before the 2004 pension legislation). Based on estimates by<lb/> Stirling Finance, Hong Kong, China 7 , the overall (legacy and new) EA assets in China could grow<lb/> to the level of RMB 700bn by 2015, although more optimistic estimates see RMB 700bn five<lb/> years earlier, i.e. by 2010, as indicated in the same report.</figDesc>

Pillar 1A provides defined benefits and operates on a PAYG basis, with contributions at 20% of payroll and<lb/> wholly from enterprises; the target replacement rate is 35% of the final-year salary. Pillar 1B should in theory be fully<lb/> funded with sole contributions of 8% of salaries from employees; the target replacement rate is 24.2%.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Concerning the new EA funds (i.e. those based on Decrees 20 and 23), statistics show that as of<lb/> June 2006, 263 enterprises (mostly large profitable companies) in China had established such<lb/> (single company) occupational pension plans. The corresponding number of participants was<lb/> 940,000 and total assets amounted to RMB 11bn. It is noted that before 2004, a large amount of<lb/> EA assets were managed by the local EA Administration Centres (part of the labour bureaus, and<lb/> whose main responsibility is to manage assets in pillars 1A and 1B). However, due to pension<lb/> investment scandals across the country (particularly that in Shanghai in 2006), the Chinese central<lb/> government has recently shown their willingness to transfer all those EA funds (i.e. currently<lb/> managed by the local social security bureaus) to the private sector by 2007. In this context, on 26<lb/> April 2007, one guideline from MOLSS was released, detailing how such legacy funds should be<lb/> transferred. The key message is that all assets (i.e. from a to d above) should be handed over to the<lb/> qualified institutions which implicitly refer to licensed financial institutions.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>For example the<lb/> local EA Administration Centres in different localities in China effectively operate collective<lb/> pension funds. The existing industry funds managing legacy EAs are the other main form of CPFs<lb/> in the country.<lb/> a) CPFs through local social security EA Administration Centres<lb/> The Administration Centres in Shanghai and Shenzhen were the largest such arrangements in<lb/> China. Beside these, similar centres have also been created in other parts of the country, e.g. in<lb/> Liaoning Province. Participating firms whose EA assets are managed by these local government<lb/> centres are not necessarily linked by common ownership, or in the same industry. However, the<lb/> majority of these participating firms are indeed profitable enterprises. The establishment of such<lb/> centres is a typical example of intervention of the Chinese authorities to facilitate the development<lb/> of chosen industries. However, based on the central government&apos;s plan to externalise the EA<lb/> assets currently under control by local governments, the EA Administration Centres in China have<lb/> been in the process of transformation. In principle, different options have been identified as<lb/> possible solutions:<lb/> a1) The EA Admin Centres terminate administering and managing EA assets by a date specified<lb/> by the central government, and all assets currently under management are returned back to the<lb/> participating firms; then the firms themselves choose licensed trustees and other qualified service<lb/> providers;<lb/> a2) Similar to the above, but the participating firms set up their own internal trustee boards, which<lb/> then select qualified service providers;<lb/> a3) All businesses of the EA Admin Centres are transferred to one or more licensed trustees;<lb/> a4) The local EA Admin Centres are restructured from being de facto local governmental agencies<lb/> to independent commercial trustees (i.e. collective pension trustees in a particular region).<lb/> It is noted that recently (i.e. January 2007) the Shenzhen Admin Centre adopted the a3) approach.<lb/> In this regard, all the EA assets were transferred to China Merchants Bank (as custodian and<lb/> account administrator), and Pingan Life (as trustee and asset manager). The transfer involved 250<lb/> participating firms with assets at RMB 2.3 billion. Although participating firms are allowed to</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Self managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) which are funds with fewer than five members,<lb/> where each member is also a trustee of the fund and none of the members are arms length<lb/> employees of other members.
