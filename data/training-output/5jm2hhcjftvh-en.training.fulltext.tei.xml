			<head>............................................................... 29<lb/> 1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Subjective well-being reflects the notion of measuring how people experience and evaluate their lives.<lb/> It includes evaluation of life as a whole (generally referred as life satisfaction), evaluations of particular<lb/> domains of life (for example, satisfaction with time available for leisure), feelings and emotions, as well<lb/> measures of &quot; meaningfulness &quot; or &quot; purpose &quot; in life. Subjective aspects provide important information about<lb/> quality of life but also a better understanding of its determinants and thus can complement other outcome<lb/> measures as an alternative yardstick of progress (<ref type="biblio">Stiglitz et al., 2008</ref>). In particular, measures of subjective<lb/> well-being are uniquely placed to provide information on the net impact of changes in social and economic<lb/> conditions on the perceived well-being of respondents, taking into account the impact of differences in<lb/> tastes and preferences among individuals (OECD, 2013).<lb/> The OECD framework to measure well-being at national level encompasses two dimensions that are<lb/> measured uniquely with subjective indicators, life satisfaction and social connections, and includes some<lb/> subjective indicators alongside with objective ones in the dimensions of health and environment (OECD<lb/> Better Life Index http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/). In recent years, several national and international<lb/> statistical offices have started producing subjective well-being data encompassing different measures as<lb/> recommended by the OECD Guidelines on measuring subjective well-being (</p>

			<table>OECD, 2013): Australia<lb/> (2014), Canada (since 1985), Israel (2006), Italy (1993), Korea (2013), Mexico (2012), New Zealand<lb/> (2014), Turkey (2013), United Kingdom (2012) and United States (2011). Subjective evaluations were<lb/> collected for the first time in European official statistics through the 2013 ad-hoc module of EU statistics<lb/> on income and living conditions (EU SILC) covering 25 European OECD countries (Eurostat, 2015).<lb/> While the domains and questions of the national surveys are getting more and more similar, a full<lb/> comparability across countries has not yet been established. The OECD still relies on the world-wide<lb/> Gallup survey for some of the subjective indicators in the Better Life Index.<lb/></table>

			<p>Data constraints prevented the inclusion of subjective measures in the OECD measurement of well-<lb/>being in regions (OECD, 2014). The World Gallup Poll is designed to be representative only at the national<lb/> level, few national surveys have been expanded to be representative at the subnational level (Italy, Mexico,<lb/> Turkey and the United Kingdom), and for some European countries included in the EU SILC module on<lb/> well-being regional identifiers are available. Currently, the measurement of well-being in OECD regions<lb/> includes eleven headline objective indicators to monitor outcomes in regions along nine well-being<lb/> dimensions (OECD Regional Well-Being http://www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org/index.html).<lb/> This paper provides, for the first time, subjective well-being indicators for 373 OECD subnational<lb/> regions, allowing comparison within and across all 34 OECD countries. These estimates are derived from<lb/> individual responses to the Gallup survey. Different weighting strategies as well as several robustness<lb/> checks have been carried out to ensure regional representativeness and to provide reliable indicators. It<lb/> should be noted that, in order to increase the sample size, all the annual waves of the Gallup survey<lb/> between 2006 and 2014 are pooled together; thus the results provide just one observation in time.<lb/></p>

			<p>Various questions from the Gallup survey are investigated in order to provide regional estimates of<lb/> different well-being dimensions, including life satisfaction, social connections, environment, safety, and<lb/> governance. In addition, regional variables are estimated for some European countries from the 2013<lb/> module on well-being of the EU SILC. The selected variables from EU SILC differ from Gallup and<lb/> include questions on life satisfaction, social connections, work-life balance, access to services, safety, and<lb/> governance. The regional coverage from EU SILC varies from 7 to 16 countries depending on the<lb/> questions. Robustness checks on the regional samples from EU SILC have not been carried out; instead the<lb/> regional estimates are used for comparison with the results derived from Gallup, when the questions and<lb/> measurements are similar, to test the goodness of fit to official statistics.<lb/></p>

			<p>The choice of the survey questions investigated derives from the following considerations. First, the<lb/> paper tests whether it is possible to expand the OECD regional well-being measurement to include two<lb/> dimensions, currently available only at the national level, which are measured through subjective<lb/> indicators: life satisfaction and social connections (meaning having someone to rely on in case of need).<lb/> Second, previous work at the subnational level has underlined the importance of including people&apos;s<lb/> evaluations of particular domains to complement objective indicators (OECD, 2014; OECD 2015a). The<lb/> paper provides regional estimation for a selection of subjective indicators, derived from Gallup or EU<lb/> SILC, in the dimensions of governance and civic engagement, access to services (including evaluations on<lb/> the quality of services), safety, environment, and work-life balance.<lb/> The results show that it is possible to obtain robust regional estimates of subjective well-being<lb/> through the Gallup Poll for six selected measures: life satisfaction, social connections, perception of<lb/> corruption, satisfaction with quality of water, satisfaction with quality of air, and feeling of safety. The<lb/> estimates are available for all the OECD TL2 regions with the exception of five: Yukon, Northwest<lb/> Territories, and Nunavut (Canada) and Helsinki-Uusimaa and Aland (Finland).<lb/> Regional values on life satisfaction from Gallup vary from 4.4 to 8.6 on a zero-ten point scale, a gap<lb/> that is 1.6 times larger than the one among countries. The regional values on life satisfaction from Gallup<lb/> are highly correlated with those derived from official statistics (either EU SILC or national surveys),<lb/> suggesting the possibility of using the Gallup estimates to add life satisfaction in the OECD Regional<lb/> Well-Being Database as &quot; place holder &quot; to be substituted by official statistics as they become available in<lb/> more countries. Similarly, regional values can be estimated for the social support network (social<lb/> connections) from Gallup, although the comparison with official statistics via EU SILC was possible only<lb/> for five European countries.<lb/> Finally, the paper suggests an additional set of self-reported indicators that could be made available at<lb/> the subnational level in the future. To this aim, it would be important to replicate the well-being module in<lb/> the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) and expand the geographical<lb/> coverage to regions, at least for those indicators, such as satisfaction with commuting, satisfaction with<lb/> services and living environment, or perception of safety in the area of residence, which are more<lb/> meaningful when measured at a more granular territorial scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paper is organised as follow. Section 2 provides a description of the main source of data (Gallup<lb/> World Poll) together with an assessment of the regional sample representativeness. Section 3 provides<lb/> comparative results across regions in OECD countries for the variables in the dimensions of life<lb/> satisfaction and social connections. This section also compares the results of the regional values for life<lb/> satisfaction obtained by the Gallup World Poll, the EU SILC and the national surveys with subnational<lb/> samples from Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Section 4 presents the results for a selection of<lb/> subjective variables, derived from Gallup or EU SILC that could be included in well-being dimensions<lb/> already measured at the regional level with objective variables. Section 5 concludes with suggestions on<lb/> possible uses of the results.<lb/></p>

			<p>The</p>

			<table>Gallup World Poll (Gallup) is a repeated cross-sectional survey that (following the Gallup<lb/> Macroeconomic Path framework) gathers people&apos;s opinions and self-evaluations on matters related to Law<lb/> and Order, Food and Shelter, Institutions and Infrastructure, Good Jobs, Well-Being, and Brain Gain 2 . As<lb/> of 2015, nine waves have been collected in which the survey has covered 165 countries and territories from<lb/> 2006 to 2014. Surveys are carried</table>

			<p>out face to face and/or via telephone depending on the country. All<lb/> samples are probability based and nationally representative (including rural areas) of the population aged<lb/> 15 years and above. The typical sample size is of 1 000 for a country-year combination. The 6 variables of<lb/> interest extracted from Gallup are life satisfaction, social connections, perception of corruption, feeling of<lb/> safety, satisfaction with quality of water and satisfaction with quality of air.<lb/> This paper focuses on the 34 OECD countries and more precisely on its 379 large regions, of which<lb/> 373 3 are identifiable and available in Gallup. Estimating subjective well-being indicators at the TL2 level<lb/> requires further splitting of the country samples, which for some low-populated regions might generate<lb/> considerably small samples and thus unreliable and/or unrepresentative indicators. The first step to tackle<lb/> this issue is to pool together the nine available waves of Gallup and to estimate indicators for the period<lb/> 2006-2014 (instead of annual indicators). 4 Nevertheless, since the variables of interest have not been<lb/> collected for every country every year, there are still a few regions for which small sample size might be a<lb/> concern. Survey sample sizes vary across regions and variables 5 , whereas the average sample size for the<lb/> variable life satisfaction is 727, the average sample size for satisfaction with air quality is 528. <ref type="figure">Figure 1<lb/></ref> shows the distribution of the regional sample sizes by variable. For any variable, at least 84% of the<lb/> regions (313 out of 373) have sample sizes larger than 100 observations. For life satisfaction, around 72%<lb/> of the regions have sample sizes larger than 200; while for the other variables only around 65% of the<lb/> regions do.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Distribution of sample sizes across regions<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from Gallup Poll (2006-2013).<lb/></figure>

			<p>In general the subjective well-being indicators from Gallup are estimated as in (1), where the<lb/> subjective well-being variable is first estimated for an individual í µí± of gender-age group í µí± and in region í µí±<lb/> (for a given variable í µí±, the sub-index í µí± won&apos;t be included to simplify the notation</p>

			<figure>) 6 :<lb/> í µí±í µí±í µí°µ í µí±í µí± =<lb/> ∑ í µí±¤ í µí±í µí±í µí± í µí±¥ í µí±í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí±=1<lb/> ∑ í µí±¤ í µí±í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí±=1<lb/></figure>

			<p>(1)<lb/></p>

			<p>Where í µí±¤ í µí±í µí±í µí± denotes the weights provided by Gallup 7 and í µí±¥ í µí±í µí±í µí± it&apos;s the value of the well-being measure<lb/> (for life satisfaction it is a value from 0 to 10, and for the other variables it is a value from 0 to 1). There<lb/> are 6 gender-age groups (í µí± ∈ (1, … , í µí°º = 6), which were determined based on the statistical analysis and<lb/> results presented in the following subsection) and 373 regions; í µí± í µí±í µí± stands for the sample size of the group<lb/> g in region í µí±. Once subjective well-being has been estimated by group and region, it is possible to apply<lb/> equation 2 to aggregate the groups of the same region by reweighting accordingly to the real population<lb/> shares of the 6 gender-age groups. Subjective well-being in region r is then obtained as:<lb/></p>

			<figure>í µí±í µí±í µí°µ í µí± = ∑ í µí¼ í µí±í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí°µ í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí°º<lb/> í µí±=1<lb/> (2)<lb/> where í µí¼ í µí±í µí± =<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> ∑<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> í µí°º<lb/> í µí±=1<lb/> is the real-population share of group g.<lb/></figure>

			<p>To assess and improve the reliability of these indicators, three analyses are carried out. First, for all<lb/> the OECD countries surveyed population shares by gender and age groups are compared to the real-<lb/>population shares of the same groups in the region. In the same vein, statistical tests are performed to<lb/> determine if the sample proportion of a given gender-age group is statistically the same as the population<lb/> proportion; this part of the analysis concludes with the decision of reweighting the indicators in a way that<lb/> they fit the distribution of the different gender-age groups observed in the real population. Second, for the<lb/> estimated indicators, 95% confidence intervals are built for every region. Finally, the estimated values of<lb/> life satisfaction and social connections from Gallup are compared to its counterparts from other official<lb/> sources. More precisely, life satisfaction at the regional level from Gallup is compared to the variable &quot; life<lb/> satisfaction &quot; from EU SILC (16 countries of the European Union) 8 , INEGI (Mexico&apos;s states), ISTAT<lb/> (Italy&apos;s regions), and ONS (United Kingdom&apos;s regions). On the other hand, because of lack of data from<lb/> national surveys, the variable on social connections in regions from Gallup is compared only to its<lb/> counterpart variable &quot; help from others &quot; from EU SILC (available at the regional level for 7 European<lb/> countries).<lb/></p>

			<head>Population comparison by gender-age groups<lb/></head>

			<p>To</p>

			<figure>perform this analysis eight gender-age groups are defined, for each gender there are the following<lb/> 4 age classes: between 15 and 34 years old, between 35 and 54, between 55 and 74, and between 74 and 99<lb/> years old. The sample shares come from Gallup and the real-population shares are the 2006-2014 average<lb/> population values from the OECD Regional Database. 9<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> displays descriptive statistics of the difference in percentage points of the proportion of<lb/> people in each group between the Gallup Poll and the official population data. Positive values indicate an<lb/> over sampling of that particular group in the survey, while negative values denote an under sampling. On<lb/> average almost all age groups are well represented, with average differences between the surveyed and<lb/> total population shares varying between 1.5 and 1.9 percentage points (in absolute values). However, the<lb/> max and min statistics reveal important deviations for some gender-age groups in certain variables. For<lb/> example, the group &quot; females 35-54 years old &quot; is oversampled by 35 percentage points in the Canadian<lb/> region of Prince Edward Island (CA11), mainly because of the relative importance of a deviation in the<lb/> sampling gains under such a small sample. Similarly, for the variable quality of water in the Mexican<lb/> region of Baja California Sur (ME03) the proportion of &quot; males 15-34 years old &quot; is 20.3 percentage points<lb/> lower than the population proportion observed in the census data.<lb/></p>

			<head>Estimation of confidence intervals<lb/></head>

			<p>Confidence intervals at the 95% by region and variable are estimated to be more precise about the<lb/> reliability of the regional estimates from Gallup. The confidence intervals of the proportion variables (i.e.<lb/> social connections, perception of corruption, feeling of safety, satisfaction with quality of water and<lb/> satisfaction with quality of air) are estimated as follows:<lb/></p>

			<table>í µí° ¶í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±<lb/> 95%<lb/> = 1.96√<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí± (1 − í µí± í µí±í µí± )<lb/> í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> (3)<lb/></table>

			<p>Where í µí± denotes the question and í µí± the region; while í µí± í µí±í µí± and í µí± í µí±í µí± denote respectively the proportion<lb/> of positive answers ( &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; ) and the sample size.<lb/></p>

			<figure>For the variable life satisfaction, which is measured on a zero-ten point scale the confidence intervals<lb/> are calculated as:<lb/> í µí° ¶í µí°¼ í µí±í µí±<lb/> 95%<lb/> = 1.96<lb/> í µí¼ í µí±í µí±<lb/> √í µí± í µí±í µí±<lb/> (4)<lb/> where í µí¼ í µí±í µí± denotes the sample standard deviation and í µí± í µí±í µí± the sample size.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the majority of the cases sample sizes are large enough to have acceptable margins of error; the<lb/> average values of the confidence intervals for the proportion variables lie between 4 and 6 percentage<lb/> points (see <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). There are, however, few regions in Chile, Italy, Mexico, Spain and the United States<lb/> where the confidence intervals are very high, mainly due to small sample sizes. 10 Caution is necessary in<lb/> interpreting results in these cases.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Adding new dimensions to the regional well-being: Life satisfaction and Social connections<lb/> Life satisfaction<lb/></head>

			<p>Promoting well-being is the ultimate goal of policies, stated, for example, in the 1993 Treaty of the<lb/> European Union, and well-being measurement would not be complete without considering a person&apos;s<lb/> overall assessment of their life. In the OECD Better Life Initiative, subjective well-being, or life<lb/> satisfaction, represents one of the aspects of well-being alongside other dimensions, such as jobs, education<lb/> outcomes, safety, health, etc. (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2015b</ref>). Therefore in the OECD framework the maximization of life<lb/> satisfaction is one of the goals of public policy together with other dimensions, as opposed to other<lb/> approaches where life satisfaction is considered the sole measure of overall well-being, with material<lb/> conditions and quality of life possible drivers of it. 11<lb/> Life satisfaction in Gallup is measured with the question &quot; Please imagine a ladder, with steps<lb/> numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for<lb/> you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder<lb/> would you say you personally feel you stand at this time? &quot; , answers take values from 0 to 10 (also &quot; don&apos;t<lb/> know &quot; and &quot; refused to reply &quot; ) at the individual level, while the indicator at the regional (country) level is<lb/> simply the weighted average of those individual who gave a response (from 0 to 10) in a given region<lb/> (country). The average values by country vary from 4.9 in Hungary to 7.6 in Denmark and Switzerland;<lb/> while the regional values range from 4.4 in the Mediterranean Region East (Turkey) to 8.6 in Campeche<lb/> (Mexico). The largest regional differences are found in Mexico, Chile and Turkey (<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. Regional variation in life satisfaction<lb/> Mean satisfaction with life; 0-10 points scale; average 2006-2014<lb/> Note: Countries are ordered by increasing regional variation.<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from Gallup World Poll data.<lb/> Regional responses on life satisfaction from the Gallup survey were benchmarked against the national<lb/> surveys of Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom whose samples are designed to be representative at the<lb/> subnational level, and, for the European countries, with the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions<lb/> (EU SILC). In general the formulation of the question on life satisfaction is similar in the different surveys,<lb/> although only Gallup uses the image of the ladder while the other surveys ask directly &quot; Overall, how<lb/> satisfied are you with your life nowadays? &quot; The answers are on an 11 points scale (from zero to ten) for all<lb/> the surveys, while the target population slightly differs in age (14 years and over in Italy, 15 years and over<lb/> in Mexico and 16 years and over in the United Kingdom). Other OECD countries have published official<lb/> data on subjective well-being at subnational level, although we could not use them for this paper. Since<lb/> 2013 the Life Satisfaction Survey in Turkey, for example, has been expanded to the regional and provincial<lb/> levels (corresponding to the TL2 and TL3 OECD regions). 12 However, the survey includes a question on<lb/> happiness on a 3 points scale but no questions on satisfaction with life. Evaluation of life satisfaction at the<lb/> provincial level in Canada (OECD TL2 regions) on an 11 points scale is available through the Canadian<lb/> Community Health Survey run by Statistics Canada. However, the provincial results are presented only as<lb/> number of people who reported to be satisfied or very satisfied. 13<lb/> Large regional variations exist in life satisfaction in Italy. On average in 2013, 39.5% of citizens from<lb/> the North express a high satisfaction with life, 34% from the Centre and 29.6% from the South; regional<lb/> differences have narrowed since 2009, because of the decrease in life satisfaction from the Northern<lb/> regions (Istat, 2014). On average life satisfaction was equal to 7.8 in the Province of Bolzano and 6.5 in<lb/> Campania in the period 2010-2014</figure>

			<p>, according to the Istat &quot; Indagine sugli aspetti della vita quotidiana &quot;<lb/> (Survey on Daily Life Aspects). Regional values are highly comparable with those from the Gallup Survey,<lb/> although the values from the latter are lower than those from the national survey (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). 14 The two<lb/> rankings are positively correlated with a 99% confidence interval: The Spearman&apos;s coefficient is equal to<lb/> 0.7 on a scale between zero (perfect independence between the two rankings) and one (perfect coincidence<lb/> of the two rankings) (<ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). 15<lb/></p>

			<p>Life satisfaction is generally high in Mexico: the average levels on a scale from 0 to 10 varied from<lb/> 7.6 in Oaxaca to 8.3 in Coahuila, according to the national survey BIARE average on the period 2012-<lb/>2014. The regional variation is larger according to the Gallup Poll, between 6.2 in Guerrero to 8.6 in<lb/> Campeche (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). According to the Spearman&apos;s coefficient, the two state rankings agreement is equal<lb/> to 0.33 on a scale between zero (perfect independence between the two rankings), and one (perfect<lb/> coincidence of the two rankings).The correlation among the rankings is statistically significant with a 95%<lb/> confidence interval but not with a 99% confidence interval. The relative rankings from Gallup and BIARE<lb/> differ mostly in the identification of the states with top and bottom values of life satisfaction. For example,<lb/> only the state of Tamaulipas is included among the top five states in both rankings and only the states of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Guerrero</ref> and Morelos are included among the bottom five states in both rankings. It should be noted, when<lb/> comparing the two rankings, that the reference period for Gallup is average of 2006-2013, while the<lb/> national survey&apos;s values are computed as the average of 2012 and 2014 (Table 5).<lb/> Figure 4. Life satisfaction in Mexican states<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from World Gallup Survey and INEGI BIARE 2012 and 2014.<lb/> Life satisfaction at the subnational level is collected in the United Kingdom through the Annual<lb/> Population Survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS, 2015).

			<head>The impacts of individual and regional characteristics on life satisfaction<lb/></head>

			<p>Existing literature has explored individual-level determinants of life satisfaction and results generally<lb/> hold across countries and time regarding the impacts of income, age, education, self-reported health, or<lb/> marital status on life satisfaction (<ref type="biblio">Bjørnskov et al, 2006</ref> for a review of literature). Fewer studies, instead<lb/> attempt to understand the impact of country or regional level characteristics on life satisfaction and results<lb/> are mixed (<ref type="biblio">Bjørnskov et al, 2006; Helliwell and Huang, 2011; Di Tella and McCulloch, 2006</ref>). This is,<lb/> however, a growing field, since a better understanding of the relationships between life satisfaction and<lb/> macro-level indicators -such as labour market performance, quality of government, quality of services and<lb/> education, can shed light on policy interventions to improve well-being, while individual-level<lb/> characteristics are much less amenable to change by policies (see OECD, 2015 for an example on<lb/> Mexico&apos;s states).<lb/></p>

			<p>In our empirical specification life satisfaction of the individual í µí± in region í µí± and in year í µí±¡ (í µí°¿í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ) is<lb/> associated to its individual characteristics (í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ), regional time-varying factors (í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ ), time fixed effects<lb/> (í µí»¾ í µí±¡ ), regional fixed effects (í µí¼ í µí± ) and unobserved individual characteristics (í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ ) (equation 5). Given the<lb/> available data, this is the specification that captures most of the variance in individual life satisfaction<lb/> (around 25%).<lb/></p>

			<figure>í µí°¿í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ = í µí»½í µí± í µí±í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¿í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ + í µí»¾ í µí±¡ + í µí¼ í µí± + í µí¼ í µí±í µí±í µí±¡<lb/> (5)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The simplest specification (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, column 1) we run a regression of life satisfaction against the set<lb/> of individual characteristics without including regional variables (í µí± í µí±í µí±¡ and í µí¼ í µí± ). The second specification<lb/> includes the regional fixed effects and two time-variant variables (population density and unemployment<lb/> rate). The comparison of column 1 and 2 of <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> provides insights on the contribution of regional<lb/> aspects in addition to individual-level characteristics to explain life satisfaction. Finally, the third<lb/> specification (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, column 3), substitutes the regional fixed effects with observable time-invariant<lb/> regional characteristics (í µí¼ í µí± is substituted with í µí¼í µí± í µí± ), the purpose of this estimation is to get an idea of the<lb/> part of the variance of the regional fixed effects that can be explained by observable (time-invariant)<lb/> regional characteristics.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the results of the three aforementioned specifications. In all three specifications, the<lb/> sign of the individual characteristics are as expected and confirm previous results; the magnitudes of the<lb/> coefficients, as well as their statistical significance, don&apos;t vary substantially across specifications. Higher<lb/> incomes, higher levels of education, being employed, having a good support network, feeling safe, being<lb/> satisfied with the quality of the environment (air and water) are all significantly positively associated to<lb/> higher levels of life satisfaction. On the other hand being unemployed, perception of governmental<lb/> corruption and being a male are negatively related to life satisfaction. Life satisfaction tends to decrease<lb/> with age until a turning point in which the marginal effect of an additional year yields an improvement in<lb/> the subjective evaluation (the relation between age and life satisfaction is not linear).<lb/></p>

			<p>Other empirical specifications with different regional variables have been tested; however, the lack of<lb/> data for all the OECD regions generates a trade-off between the geographical coverage (and sample size)<lb/> and the completeness of the model (the number of explanatory variables). Some of these regressions are<lb/> presented in the Annex (see <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>), although more refinements in data collection at the regional level are<lb/> still necessary for a more precise study of the regional determinants of individual subjective well-being.<lb/> The results show that the economic development and housing conditions affect positively and significantly<lb/> life satisfaction, and the lack of safety in urban regions has a significant negative impact. Whereas the size<lb/> of the coefficient of the number of rooms in a household is around one third the one of the unemployment<lb/> rate, the magnitude of the coefficient of the average regional GDP per capita is considerably and<lb/> surprisingly small.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social connections<lb/></head>

			<p>Good interpersonal relations, social network supports and general trust in others and institutions are<lb/> considered important sources of individual well-being and social cohesion. Not only they represent<lb/> additional resources to the material and cultural ones, but they can also improve performance of<lb/> institutions and reduce transaction costs (<ref type="biblio">Bourdieu, 1986; Helliwell, 2005; Putnam, 2001</ref>).<lb/> To measure social connections, the Gallup question selected is &quot; If you were in trouble, do you have<lb/> relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not? &quot; 18 In most OECD<lb/> regions, at least 80% of people report having someone to rely on in case of need. The exceptions are Korea<lb/> where the values range between 73% to 79%, and Mexico, Chile, Turkey and Greece where regional<lb/> differences are very large with some regional values well below 75% (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> 19 ).<lb/> Figure 7.

			<head>Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from Gallup World Poll data<lb/></head>

			<p>A similar question on the perceived social support is included in the 2013 EU SILC as well as a<lb/> question on trust in others. 20 Regional values, however, could be estimated only for the Czech Republic,<lb/> Finland, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. According to these values, on average around 90% or<lb/> more people feel they have friends to rely on; the largest regional differences are found in Spain, although<lb/> the three lowest values correspond to small regions (islands) and the estimates are less accurate. Feelings<lb/> of trust in others were the highest in Finland, on average 7.3 on a 0-10 points scale, and the lowest in<lb/> France, between 4.4 in Limousin and 5.6 in Corse.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Subjective indicators to complement objective indicators<lb/></head>

			<p>This section seeks to expand measures of quality of life introducing subjective indicators to<lb/> complement the objective ones already available in OECD regions via the OECD Regional Well-Being<lb/> Database. The well-being dimensions were selected with considerations on introducing evaluations of<lb/> particular domains of life (safety, work-life balance), evaluations on the quality of services (access to<lb/> services, environment) and measures of social capital and citizens&apos; feedback on government activities<lb/> (civic engagement and governance). 21 Five variables are derived from the Gallup Poll and computed at the<lb/> regional level; other relevant variables from EU SILC 2013 are discussed for future reflection, since<lb/> regional values are currently available only for a limited number of European countries (<ref type="table">Table 7</ref>). Some of<lb/> the subjective variables provide additional information on specific well-being dimensions not previously<lb/> captured with the objective variables (for example of trust, perception of corruption, satisfaction with<lb/> commuting, etc.), while others complement the objective measures on safety and environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Safety<lb/></head>

			<p>Personal safety is one of the most critical dimensions of well-being. Crime has not only a direct effect<lb/> on the victims and their families, but also on those who are not victims but live in the same community and<lb/> on the socio-economic development of these communities. Perception of safety complements objective<lb/> measures such as crime rates or homicide rates. Subjective measures of safety are also correlated to trust in<lb/> the public institutions and trust in the effectiveness of law enforcement (OECD, 2015a). Regional variation<lb/> in the perception of safety is large in many OECD countries. According to the Gallup measure at least 50%<lb/> of people do not feel safe to walk alone at night in 28 regions in Chile, Greece, Mexico and Turkey, and<lb/> also in Moravia (Czech Republic), Central Hungary (Hungary), Slaskie (Poland), and Bratislava (Slovak<lb/> Republic) (<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). 22<lb/></p>

			<p>A very similar question on perception of safety is included in the EU SILC 2013 and it was possible<lb/> to compute regional values for six European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and<lb/> United Kingdom). With the exception of Spain, the correlations among the rankings obtained with the EU<lb/> SILC and Gallup values are statistically significant at 99%.<lb/></p>

			<head>Civic engagement and governance<lb/></head>

			<p>Citizens&apos; feedback on public institutions and their expectations on government&apos;s activities are<lb/> important aspects of social cohesion and effective democracies. Many of the policies that bear most<lb/> directly on people&apos;s lives are put into effect at the local level and citizens&apos; experience with local<lb/> institutions have often a significant impact on their trust, behaviour and well-being (<ref type="biblio">Hudson, 2006; Tavits,<lb/> 2008</ref>). The variable chosen to be included in the Governance and civic engagement dimension refer to the<lb/> percentage of people who believe corruption is widespread throughout government in their country.<lb/> According to the Gallup results, in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, New<lb/> Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, corruption is low (below 40%) and with small regional variations. A<lb/> second group of countries includes the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy and Slovenia, where<lb/> corruption is high (between 75 and 90%) and with small regional variations. Finally, in Australia, Canada,<lb/> Chile, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the United States the perception of corruption is quite different<lb/> depending on the region of residence; although the country average values vary in these countries, regional<lb/> values differ everywhere by more than 20 percentage points (<ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/></p>

In the case of Canada and Italy the lowest values correspond to regions<lb/> that couldn&apos;t be reweighted, therefore the graph shows the second lowest value. In particular, the lowest value in Canada is Prince<lb/> Edward Island (31.7%) and in Italy is Aosta (75%).<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from Gallup World Poll data.<lb/> Trust in the political system varied between 1.5 in Cantabria and Galicia (Spain) to 6.3 in Helsinki<lb/> (Finland) among the five countries whose regional values are available from EU SILC 2013. 23 As<lb/> expected, the regional values of trust in the political system are highly negatively correlated with the<lb/> perception of corruption from Gallup (the correlation coefficient is -0.6 and -0.9 with the exclusion of the<lb/> Czech Republic).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Access to services<lb/></head>

			<p>Lack of adequate data has limited the development of national and international statistics on<lb/> accessibility to services at the sub-national level. In addition, different services (health, transport,<lb/> education, etc.) might be organised with different geographies of recipients in the same country making<lb/> difficult a common standard geography. Measures of physical accessibility are rare and even more so<lb/> measures of quality of services; satisfaction with the outcomes of certain services may provide indirect<lb/> information on the latter.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 23 out of the 34 OECD countries at least 80% of people are satisfied with the quality of water<lb/> according to the Gallup regional estimates. 24 At the same time, in around 10% of regions, concentrated in<lb/> Chile, Greece, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Spain and Turkey, less than 60% of people are satisfied with<lb/> the quality of water (<ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The EU SILC 2013 includes two questions on satisfaction with commuting time and satisfaction with<lb/> services and living environment, described as access to services, shops, and public transport as well the<lb/> presence of cinema, museums and theatres. Both questions would be very relevant at regional and city<lb/> levels, as national values may mask very different contextual conditions. Many studies find that commuters<lb/> report lower life satisfaction and higher anxiety on average than non-commuters (<ref type="biblio">Strutzer and Frey, 2004</ref>;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Lucas and Heady, 2002</ref>); that satisfaction with life decreases as commuting time increases (ONS, 2014);<lb/> and, when commuting by car, they are more likely to feel a sense of time pressure (<ref type="biblio">Hilbrecht et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> Satisfaction with commuting varied between 5.9 in Molise (Italy) to 8.7 in Northern Norway among the 14<lb/> European countries for which regional values were computed (<ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>). The regional values are<lb/> positively and significantly correlated with the values on life satisfaction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Environment<lb/></head>

			<p>People&apos;s satisfaction with the quality of air can complement objective measures of air pollution, such<lb/> as the average level of particulate matter (PM2.5) in a region, estimated through global satellite database<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Brezzi and Sanchez-Serra, 2014</ref>). As expected the two variables are significantly negatively correlated<lb/> although with differences across countries (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). While in some countries, such as Belgium, Finland,<lb/> France, Germany and the Slovak Republic, higher levels of air pollution in regions correspond to lower<lb/> subjective satisfaction with the quality of air, in other countries the two measures are not significantly<lb/> correlated, for example in Austria, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.<lb/></p>

			<head>Work-life balance<lb/></head>

			<p>Regional estimates on the satisfaction with time use are also available for 14 European countries<lb/> through EU SILC 2013. On a zero-ten points scale (with 10 completely satisfied), regional averages varied<lb/> between 5.6 in Basilicata (Italy) to 7.9 in Zealand and Nortern Jutland (Denmark) (<ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>From EU SILC 2013, it is possible to include a question on the share of people who have worked<lb/> more than 50 hours the previous week, as indirect measure of time available for non-work activities. The<lb/> available regional data from 12 countries vary from around 1% of employees worked more than 50 hours<lb/> in the previous week in Norrland (Sweden), Zealand (Denmark) and Western Slovenia, to more than 4%<lb/> employees in 10 regions in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland. In the future, regional<lb/> values of this variable may become available from national surveys on time-use or from labour force<lb/> statistics. 25<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>The paper assesses the use of the Gallup World Poll to provide subnational averages of subjective<lb/> well-being and self-reported indicators in the 379 OECD regions. Countries&apos; samples were reweighted to<lb/> increase the comparability with the demographic profile of a region. The results suggest good sample<lb/> representativeness at the regional level, at least when restricting the age of respondents to 15-74 years, and<lb/> very few missing regions.<lb/> 25 The OECD Better Life Index includes a similar variable at the national level from Labour Force Statistics (OECD<lb/> 2015b).<lb/></p>

			<p>When possible, regional estimates from Gallup are benchmarked with results derived from the 2013<lb/> module on well-being of the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC) and from<lb/> national surveys designed to be representative at the regional level.<lb/> Two main conclusions can be drawn. First, the variables satisfaction with life and social support<lb/> network can be estimated for all the OECD (TL2) regions. This will allow, for example, to expand the<lb/> OECD Well-Being Database to the subnational level to include two subjective dimensions, kept distinct<lb/> from the existing ones currently measured with objective indicators. Life satisfaction estimates from<lb/> Gallup are highly correlated with responses derived from official statistics (EU SILC 2013 and national<lb/> surveys) suggesting the possibility to use Gallup values as &quot; place holders &quot; while more regional values for<lb/> official sources become available.<lb/> Second, future replicates of the 2013 well-being module of EU SILC may include a selection of<lb/> indicators with subnational sample representativeness. In addition to life satisfaction and social support<lb/> networks, which are becoming standard measures in many surveys, this paper suggests few variables that<lb/> are particularly meaningful when measured at the city or regional levels: satisfaction with the living<lb/> environment, satisfaction with commuting time, trust in the political system, and perception of safety in<lb/> own &apos;s community. These variables could in the future complement objective indicators in the dimensions<lb/> of accessibility to services, environment, safety, and governance and civic engagement. Importantly, future<lb/> replicates would allow monitoring changes over time, which is currently limited to few countries.</p>
