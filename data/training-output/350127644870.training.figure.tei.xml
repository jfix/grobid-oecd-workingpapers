            <figDesc>Two 330-MW units were constructed by the national electric utility, Office National de l&apos;Electricité<lb/> (ONE), and placed in service in 1994 and 1995. During this period, the national legal framework was<lb/> modified to allow independent power production, and in 1994, ONE requested bids for the construction of<lb/> two additional units. Because the electricity law required that power assets be owned by ONE, the agency<lb/> sought a builder-operator team to construct the two new units and operate all four units with a 30-year<lb/> power purchase agreement.<lb/> ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd (Zurich) and CMS Morocco Operating Co., a wholly owned subsidiary<lb/> of CMS Energy Corporation (Dearborn, Michigan, USA) were the chosen bidders to build and operate the<lb/> power plant. These entities formed the jointly owned Jorf Lasfar Energy Company and entered into a long-<lb/>term agreement, which was a 30-year lease by the project company of the four units.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>USD 2.3 million Outsource<lb/> Sampling Program. TRC in turn contracted with a Filipino firm, Technical Experts on Environmental<lb/> Management (TEEM), to provide the manpower for data collection. The Outsource Sampling Program<lb/> involves four teams that are deploying mobile testing sets to measure stack emissions from about 1 000<lb/> sources in metropolitan Manila.<lb/> As of November 2005, 60% of the 500 emitters tested failed one or more criteria of the Philippine<lb/> clean air law. While no enforcement action has been taken to date, the initial results indicate that there is a<lb/> high rate of non-compliance. It is anticipated that the full data set and accompanying analysis will enable<lb/> the DENR to adapt appropriate enforcement protocols.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Oil companies have begun testing fuel at retail outlets, but it is believed that fuel adulterated by as<lb/> much as 30% still tests clean because of the range of values in the testing methods of the Bureau of Indian<lb/> Standards (BIS), and also because the high-quality fuels provided by oil companies can accommodate<lb/> significant adulteration without violating BIS specifications.<lb/> In 1999, CONCERT (the Center for Consumer Education, Research Teaching, Training and Testing)<lb/> in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu, took samples from 21 retail fuel outlets in Chennai. Using a<lb/> gas chromatograph method developed by a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, CONCERT&apos;s<lb/> research showed a high level of adulteration of diesel and gasoline in all 21 samples.<lb/> To more rigorously test for fuel adulteration, CONCERT proposed establishing a fuel-testing<lb/> laboratory with a gas chromatographic to compare fuel obtained from retail outlets with fuel obtained from<lb/> distribution depots and refineries. With funding and support from the Environmental Partnership Grant<lb/> Program of the U.S. Council of State Governments, the US-Asian Environmental Partnership and the<lb/> government of Tamil Nadu, and technical support and training from the California Air Resources Board,<lb/> the project broke ground in 2003 and began operating in 2004.</figDesc>
