			<body>MAIN POINTS <lb/>This report examines recent developments regarding the use of fibre to provide local access networks <lb/>(referred to inter alia as the last mile or local loop) for the provision of broadband access. Countries across <lb/>the OECD are adopting different approaches to stimulate investment and to define the terms of competition <lb/>to end-users in a Fibre to the Home/Building (FTTH/B) world. <lb/>There is no simple solution to the question of how to get FTTH/B networks built. The issues boil <lb/>down to having as much physical access competition as economically efficient, which in turn drives <lb/>investment and ultimately better deals for consumers both pre and post fibre deployment. The adoption of <lb/>FTTH/B solutions is normally preceded by strong broadband take-up. Broadband take-up is normally best <lb/>in competitive, dynamic markets with multiple fixed network competitors. Competition on the access <lb/>network is a key requirement to facilitate choice for consumers at the retail level when there is a single <lb/>Next Generation Networks (NGN) fibre access provider. Where there is more than one NGN fibre <lb/>provider, unbundling may have a role to play, but the case may be less compelling and more complicated. <lb/>Once FTTH/B is deployed, ensuring take-up, usage, innovation and consumer outcomes all benefit <lb/>from more competitive end-user markets. It can be observed from the data that there is a wide divergence <lb/>in take-up rates where fibre is deployed. Competition has consistently delivered better consumer outcomes <lb/>in terms of price and innovation and this in turn improves take-up rates. Higher take-up rates are also very <lb/>good for investors as this appears to be a key variable in determining the return period, even more so than <lb/>prices. <lb/>For those countries which do not have sufficient network competition and rely on unbundling of <lb/>existing networks, issues arise concerning how best to provide competitive access to the physical fibre and <lb/>these are related to the fibre topology. Two main topologies exist, point-to-point (PtP) or point-to-<lb/>multipoint (PtMP). In a PtP context the existing access regime can normally continue. Entrants can build <lb/>their own network utilising the incumbent&apos;s economies of scale (by renting the fibre loops, as they can <lb/>with copper today). In the event that a sufficient number of end-to-end network competitors exist, this <lb/>again does not raise an issue since competition does not depend on access. However, in the event that there <lb/>is not a sufficient number of network competitors and that competition requires access conditions on a <lb/>network, then a PtMP model presents challenges in the form of access that can be offered. Physical <lb/>unbundling does not appear to be a realistic option in most instances and virtual access products appear to <lb/>be preferable. Countries which have limited access competition today and do not have the prospect for <lb/>physical access competition in the future should ensure that such virtual access products are planned for, <lb/>and that they are the best available, so that competition to provide services to the end-user can continue. <lb/>In general end-to-end network competition is preferable to other forms of competition since <lb/>competitors compete over the entire value chain or access provision. Parallel networks may exist <lb/>independently of each other or they may be created by renting loops. One network can be shared by several <lb/>physical network access operators. This can reduce inefficient network duplication costs whilst still <lb/>allowing the benefits of economies of scale to be available to the market. <lb/></body>

			<body>Countries can take measures to lower deployment costs by giving access to existing passive <lb/>infrastructures, streamlining building permits and ensuring co-ordination of investments, all of which <lb/>should lower entry barriers. <lb/>While competition can drive FTTH/B in certain settings, it is unlikely to deliver FTTH/B universally <lb/>due to the very high costs associated with the &quot; last mile&apos; investments. Where population densities are low, <lb/>a viable business case will be especially challenging. This implies that subsequent government intervention <lb/>will be needed to deliver FTTH/B outside commercially viable areas. Significant positive externalities can <lb/>justify such interventions. However, it is important that public interventions do not interfere with or indeed <lb/>forestall private investment. Countries that clearly specify when and where they will intervene with public <lb/>finance can minimise these risks. <lb/></body>

			<front>Conditions should be attached to such public financing in order to foster future competition as much <lb/>as possible, so that consumers get the best outcomes. <lb/>Countries which wish to accelerate improvement in their FTTH/B deployment should consider <lb/>measures to improve access competition on current networks. The evidence suggests that the most <lb/>competitive access markets are making the most progress in deploying and adopting FTTH/B. <lb/></front>

			<body>Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployment and strategies <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Fibre has long been used for telecommunication networks. Since the mid-1980s it has been the <lb/>technology of choice for new backbone networks for both telecommunication and cable television <lb/>networks. More recently it has also been used to provide the final connections to some premises, first for <lb/>larger business users and now for some residential users. <lb/>The transition from copper access to fibre access networks is a source of great upheaval in the ICT <lb/>sector. It poses a series of challenges to industry and regulators to achieve the transition with positive <lb/>long-term results for consumers and society generally. This paper aims to update recent developments in <lb/>this area across OECD countries. It should be noted that the transition from copper to fibre is barely <lb/>underway in most of the World and though some countries are already making significant progress. The <lb/>drivers of investment in these new networks are multiple and it is not always possible to identify and <lb/>manage those drivers to achieve specific outcomes. However, this report seeks to examine the progress <lb/>made to date within the OECD and to look at what lessons might be drawn from that experience. <lb/>Though many specific challenges arise, the report seeks to look most carefully at two. The first <lb/>challenge, for policy makers, is to choose amongst the different approaches to encourage investments in <lb/>FTTH/B. These range from regulatory forbearance in the United States for instance, with the decision not <lb/>to extend competitive access products for third parties to fibre-based products, to an actively managed <lb/>competitive access regime in Japan. It can be observed that markets which have demonstrated the greatest <lb/>level of access competition on traditional broadband networks such as xDSL and cable television networks, <lb/>have not only delivered very good results to consumers but also seem to be leading the charge in terms of <lb/>FTTH/B investments. <lb/>This is a crucial observation because the competition on today&apos;s networks may drive itself onto <lb/>tomorrow&apos;s, ensuring not only that the networks are built but also that consumers are in a position to <lb/>exploit their potential benefits. It is also the case that take-up rates will be crucial to lower payback <lb/>periods, and indeed, to ultimately allow the existing copper networks to be switched off -to the benefit of <lb/>investors, consumers and society at large. <lb/>The second related challenge facing policy makers is how to ensure that adequate competition is <lb/>maintained on the FTTH/B networks once they are built. Two main deployment topologies are being used, <lb/>Point-to-Point (PtP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP). It is beyond the scope of this report to make an <lb/>assessment of the merits of the different topologies. Each topology has advantages and disadvantages and <lb/>OECD countries have in general given investing entities the freedom to choose their own preferred <lb/>topology. It is a fact, however, that the competitive physical access options today are much more limited <lb/>when a PtMP topology is deployed. It may be that this assessment will change as technologies develop and <lb/>improve. However, the competitive access limitations on a PtMP network may limit the scope of future <lb/>competition and this is a challenge which must be carefully assessed by policy makers. <lb/>This paper is organised as follows: first a review of where FTTH/B networks are being built is set out. <lb/>Then the drivers of investment and the deployment profiles are identified. The report looks at the sources <lb/>of funding and major investment projects currently pending. It also consider the types of networks being <lb/>deployed, whether PtP or PtMP and considers the implications for competitive access solutions. Finally, <lb/>some conclusions are synthesised into a number of policy suggestions. <lb/></body>

			<body>Defining FTTH/B <lb/>For the purposes of this study Fibre-to-the Home (FTTH) and Fibre-to-the-Building (FTTB) are <lb/>classified together as FTTH/B. <lb/>While it should be noted that, at the time of writing there are also two other network solutions <lb/>competing for customers and in places being installed – Fibre-to-the-Curb (FTTC) and Cable -these are <lb/>not the subject of this report (although cable&apos;s role as a driver of competitive effects is remarked upon). <lb/>In terms of network topologies (rather than technologies), the reader should be aware that there are <lb/>two main options. The first option, Point-to-Point (PtP), looks relatively similar to the existing copper <lb/>network topology insofar as each consumer has a dedicated fibre. The second topology is <lb/>Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP) where a portion of the access network is shared amongst a number of users. <lb/>See Annex 1 for a more detailed description of these items. <lb/>Where FTTH networks are being built <lb/>A distinction needs to be drawn between where networks are actually being built as opposed to being <lb/>planned. A number of countries and operators with minimal deployments today are planning very <lb/>extensive deployments in the immediate future. <lb/>An assessment of actual deployment today suggests that, with some notable exceptions, FTTH/B <lb/>deployments are still tentative or at an early stage. The exceptions are Korea and Japan who have achieved <lb/>extensive FTTH/B deployments. The data suggests that there are no &quot;rules&quot; regarding who deploys what <lb/>kind of network -new entrants are deploying PtMP networks, new government-owned corporations <lb/>building networks are opting for PtMP, some incumbent operators are deploying PtP networks. Even <lb/>though there are no easy classifications possible, it can be observed that there is a clear preference for <lb/>PtMP networks amongst incumbents and that, in general, entrants have opted for PtP deployments. <lb/>An initial review of deployments to date gives the following data set out in Table 1 below. Table 1 <lb/>seeks to give a broad overview of the current state of play in FTTH roll-out across OECD countries. <lb/></body>

			<body>In terms of volumes, clearly large countries are pre-eminent with Japan, Korea and the United States <lb/>leading the way. In percentage terms, Slovenia, Portugal and Sweden outperform any other European <lb/>country. The data regarding the conversion rates of homes passed into actual connections is very varied <lb/>across the OECD members with Korea, Japan and the United States performing best with the European <lb/>area members lagging. <lb/>Figure 1 below shows FTTH as a percentage of existing broadband lines and indicates clearly that <lb/>those networks where the most progress is being made are located in the Asia Pacific region, with Northern <lb/>European and more recently some Eastern European countries making significant progress. <lb/>Figure 1: FTTH as a percentage of existing broadband lines <lb/>0.0% <lb/>10.0% <lb/>20.0% <lb/>30.0% <lb/>40.0% <lb/>50.0% <lb/>60.0% <lb/>United Kingdom <lb/>Greece <lb/>New Zealand <lb/>Australia <lb/>Spain <lb/>France <lb/>Luxembourg <lb/>Austria <lb/>Ireland <lb/>Germany <lb/>Finland <lb/>Sw itzerland <lb/>Turkey <lb/>Poland <lb/>Italy <lb/>Netherlands <lb/>Portugal <lb/>United States <lb/>Iceland <lb/>Hungary <lb/>Czech Republic <lb/>OECD <lb/>Denmark <lb/>Norw ay <lb/>Sw eden <lb/>Slovak <lb/>Korea <lb/>Japan <lb/>Percentage of fibre connections in total broadband subscriptions, June 2010 <lb/>Note: Includes fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) and fibre-to-the-building (FTTB or apartment LAN) connections.

			<body>The availability of FTTH/B solutions does not therefore imply a rate of take-up; the normal drivers of <lb/>consumer participation such as pricing and content would appear to be at least as important in a FTTH/B <lb/>environment as in a more traditional broadband context. <lb/>Table 2: Top ten countries worldwide in terms of FTTH/B subscribers <lb/>1 <lb/>Japan <lb/>15 500 000 <lb/>2 <lb/>Korea <lb/>8 050 000 <lb/>3 <lb/>United States <lb/>4 800 000 <lb/>4 <lb/>Taiwan <lb/>1 345 000 <lb/>5 <lb/>Hong Kong <lb/>740 000 <lb/>6 <lb/>Russia <lb/>724 000 <lb/>7 <lb/>China* <lb/>612 000 <lb/>8 <lb/>Sweden <lb/>478 900 <lb/>9 <lb/>Italy <lb/>324 500 <lb/>10 <lb/>France <lb/>252 900 <lb/>*Not <lb/>included <lb/>are <lb/>China <lb/>Telecom&apos;s roughly 10 million <lb/>FTTx + LAN subs <lb/>Source IDATE. Data as of Mid 2009. <lb/>Investment funding and deployment profiles <lb/>The Asia Pacific is the region where the most advanced FTTH/B deployments have been made. <lb/>Reviewing the history of countries such as Japan and Korea can be instructive in terms of identifying <lb/>investment drivers. <lb/>In September 2000, the Japanese government directed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the <lb/>incumbent operator, to unbundle its copper local loop. In 2004, partial unbundling rates were JPY 120 <lb/>(USD 1.50) per month and JPY 1,300 (USD 16) per month for total unbundling. <lb/>Softbank, a major Japanese ISP, launched its DSL service in 2001 &quot;Yahoo! BB&quot; and invested heavily <lb/>in DSL technology. When SoftBank started its (12 Mbit/s) ADSL service at a price of around JPY 3000 <lb/>USD 30) it made a huge impact in the Japanese market. The price proposed by Softbank was <lb/>approximately half the prevailing price in the market and, coupled with aggressive marketing campaigns, <lb/>led to Softbank capturing a large share of the market such that, by 2003, it was already the largest DSL <lb/>operator, even ahead of the traditional incumbent. Competitors and Softbank each dropped prices in an <lb/>iterative fashion and repeatedly offered higher speed services to entice customers with offers that quickly <lb/>ran from12 Mbit/s to 24 Mbit/s and 50 Mbit/s. <lb/>In 2004, 52.1% of Japanese households had Internet access, with more than half of these using <lb/>broadband. By March 2005, DSL had more than 13.6 million customers in Japan and the development of <lb/>FTTH became part of the competitive landscape with the arrival of operators like TEPCO (Tokyo Electric <lb/>Power Company), allied to KDDI and NTT. Three million customers were wired with FTTH in March <lb/>2005 and by 2007 it had overtaken DSL in Japan. <lb/>As noted by Cave (2010) and Ida (2009) regarding Japan, it was the competition in the supply of <lb/>xDSL (driven by low unbundling charges) which was then followed by competition in capacity that <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2010)10/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>ultimately drove fibre deployment. This allowed high fibre penetration rates to be established without <lb/>government subsidies, which were largely confined to taking high speed broadband into rural areas. <lb/>Therefore it can be observed that in Japan, the primary driver of deployment was market based <lb/>competition on the access network and that finance was privately sourced. A second step in deployment <lb/>was driven by government as concerns regarding a digital divide emerged. The Next Generation <lb/>Broadband Concept 2010 published in 2005 by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and <lb/>Communications (MIC) in Japan, identified two important steps, first, to ensure that every municipality in <lb/>Japan had broadband access by 2008 and second hat with respect to FTTH networks, over 90% of Japanese <lb/>homes had access to access networks capable of &apos;upload speeds in excess of 30 Mbps&apos; by 2010. This is <lb/>implicitly a significantly higher target than specifying a download speed and effectively excludes at a <lb/>minimum FTTC and Wireless solutions from the plan. As noted in Table 2 above, the competitive process <lb/>behind deployment seems to have also ensured a significant take-up rate with regard to the FTTH/B that <lb/>has been deployed. <lb/>The Korean Government was also very proactive in terms of ensuring first broadband and then <lb/>FTTH/B developments. In 2003 the government published the Broadband IT Korea Vision 2007 and after <lb/>the successful rollout of the broadband network, the government set out its goal for the future broadband <lb/>policy in the so-called u-Korea Masterplan (2007). <lb/>The development of the Korean fibre optic network can also be divided into two stages. The first, <lb/>starting in 2004, included the extension of the fibre network without focusing on the direct connection of <lb/>households to the new network. Development in this period was driven by policy decisions. In 2003, the <lb/>Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) amended the Facility Sharing Directive. For fibre <lb/>optics deployed before 2004, the MIC imposed obligations on Korea Telecom (KT) to open its fibre optics <lb/>to alternative operators, with regulated wholesale charges set by the MIC. For KT, fibre optics deployed <lb/>after 2004, the MIC did not impose any regulations on KT (cf. Twist, 2007). Regulatory forbearance was <lb/>also applied for the fibre deployed by other operators. Many operators started to roll out their own fibre <lb/>optic networks after this decision. For all broadband networks (copper-and cable-based), the MIC had an <lb/> &quot; open access &quot; regulation in place. In contrast to most other economies, which have only unbundled the <lb/>local loop, Korea went one step further by also unbundling the cable loop. This early competitive access <lb/>policy on broadband networks resulted in fierce competition among service providers (ITU, 2005). Again, <lb/>public finance followed in the wake of this competitive process. <lb/>In the 2003 Triennial Review Order (TRO) the United States found that &quot; excessive network <lb/>unbundling requirements tend to undermine the incentives of both incumbent LECs and new entrants to <lb/>invest in new facilities and deploy new technology. &quot; 2 The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <lb/>found in the TRO that competitive access was not appropriate for most fiber loops used to serve enterprise <lb/>and mass market customers, and reinforced that finding in 2004. 3 <lb/>On 20 March 2006, Verizon&apos;s petition for forbearance from dominant carrier regulation of high-<lb/>capacity broadband services – fiber circuits used to serve enterprise customers and as inputs by competitive <lb/>carriers – was &quot; deemed granted &quot; by operation of law. 4 The FCC granted comparable forbearance relief to <lb/>AT&amp;T 5 , Qwest 6 , and Embarq and Frontier 7 in subsequent orders in 2007, stating that &quot; [f]orbearance in <lb/>these circumstances also will increase [their] incentives to invest in advanced network technologies that <lb/>will enable it to provide enterprise customers with increasingly innovative services. &quot; 8 <lb/>Clearly, significant progress in terms of investment and homes passed has been achieved, as shown in <lb/>Figure 2 below, and the regulatory action in the United States was accompanied by a significant period of <lb/>investment where cable and telecom networks competed directly. It should be noted, again by reference to <lb/>Table 2 above, that despite the levels of FTTH/B deployment noted in the United States, take-up rates lag <lb/></body>

			<body>someway behind leaders in the OECD though, as noted by IDATE (2010) &quot;The United States, Canada and <lb/>Mexico have connected 27% more users with fibre than all of the countries in West, Central and Eastern <lb/>Europe combined&quot;. On the other hand, performance in terms of fibre access investment in the United States <lb/>is greater than in Canada and Mexico and these countries also have limited or no third-party access via <lb/>policies such as unbundling, and it is difficult to assess the effects of the global economic crisis on <lb/>demand. <lb/>At the same time, Hong Kong, China, a location with some of the most competitive broadband offers <lb/>in the world, relies almost wholly on network competition. In the OECD, Korea has been very successful <lb/>with end-to-end network competition. Geographic and demographic factors are clearly important in Korea, <lb/>Hong Kong, China and China – with high population densities -the proclivity of apartment-style <lb/>residential properties have no doubt been key factors. In these countries encouraging apartment buildings <lb/>to have &quot; points of access &quot; to which any provider can connect, have further encouraged competition. <lb/>Figure 2:United States FTTH/B homes passed <lb/>Source: RVA and FTTH Council North America. <lb/>In 2010, the effectiveness of forbearance of regulation in the United States as a driver of investment is <lb/>under renewed scrutiny. A study carried out by the Berkman Center, reviewing experience around the <lb/>world, suggested that competitive access regimes outside the United States have led to better price/quality <lb/>outcomes which may go some way towards explaining the relative under-performance of FTTH/B take-<lb/>up. 9 <lb/>In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 10 , the United States Congress directed the <lb/>FCC &quot; … to ensure that all people of the United States have access to broadband capability and [to] <lb/>establish benchmarks for meeting that goal. &quot; In support of that goal, they tasked the FCC with i) evaluating <lb/>the status of deployment, ii) analysing the most effective mechanisms for achieving broadband <lb/>access, iii) developing a strategy to ensure affordability and maximum utilisation of broadband <lb/></body>

			<body>access, and iv) providing a plan whereby broadband would further consumer welfare, civic participation, <lb/>public safety, homeland security, health care delivery, energy independence, education, and a host of other <lb/>public policy goals. <lb/>The FCC published the National Broadband Plan (NBP) in 2010. Through it, the United States <lb/>government has made a forward-looking statement of its long-range plans and has earmarked a level of <lb/>finance to encourage more marginal investments, as noted in Table 3 below. <lb/>In Europe similar considerations were given to the possibility of using regulatory forebearance as a <lb/>means to accelerate investment. The Dutch Regulator, OPTA, took the lead in this debate since it was <lb/>faced with a similar market situation to that prevailing in the United States -widely deployed (and <lb/>technologically advanced) cable networks competing directly with a traditional telecoms incumbent. In that <lb/>market, a decision was taken to forsake bitstream access for the mass market and to oblige entrant <lb/>operators to build competing networks based on Unbundling of the Local Loop (ULL) for access. ULL is <lb/>well developed in the Netherlands and as the incumbent operator signalled its intention to redesign its <lb/>network, OPTA took a considered view on regulatory forbearance. The resulting policy paper, &quot;Is two <lb/>enough&quot;, concluded: &quot; On balance the conclusion of the assessment is that in the relevant scenario there <lb/>is a significant risk that competition is not effective. &quot; <lb/>More generally in the European Union, the &quot;Europe 2020 Strategy&quot; was launched in March 2010 with <lb/>the aim of preparing Europe&apos;s economy for the next decade. In May 2010 the Commission published its <lb/>Digital Agenda element which detailed how ICT would contribute to the overall EU2020 Strategy vision <lb/>through the creation of advanced networks. Seven target areas are specified, including the need to increase <lb/>Europeans&apos; access to fast and ultra fast Internet. The target set in these policy documents is for Europe to <lb/>achieve Internet speeds of 30 Mbps or above for 100% of European citizens, with 50% or more of <lb/>European households subscribing to connections of 100Mbps or higher. <lb/>The European Commission believes it can attract investment in broadband through better and more <lb/>consistent regulation and through more operational measures such as credit enhancement mechanisms and <lb/>guidance on how to encourage investments in fibre-based networks. The vehicles to achieve these aims are <lb/>the &quot;Next Generation Access (NGA) Recommendation&quot; and the &quot;Broadband Communication&quot;. <lb/>In September 2010, the European Union published the Commission Recommendation on regulated <lb/>access to NGA networks which seeks to guide National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) as to what are the <lb/>appropriate remedies to be imposed for NGA Networks. This is a non-binding Recommendation based on <lb/>Article 19 11 of the Better Regulation Directive. NRAs must &quot;take utmost account of&quot; these guidelines <lb/>when selecting remedies as part of their analysis of Markets 4 and 5. 12 <lb/>As noted elsewhere (Cave and Shortall, 2010) preservation of competition is the European <lb/>Commission&apos;s preferred approach and access in the form of fibre unbundling and/or active access is <lb/>proposed to continue as previously. Any suggestion of regulatory forbearance in Europe has been soundly <lb/>dismissed. Access conditions on fibre based networks will include risk premiums to entice investment. <lb/>The Recommendation also puts significant emphasis on remedies which are aimed at lowering <lb/>deployment costs such as granting access to passive infrastructures. Also in September 2010, the European <lb/>Commission published its Communication &quot;European Broadband: investing in digitally driven growth&quot;. <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2010)10/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>As part of that Communication the Commission committed itself to make a proposal, in co-operation <lb/>with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2011: <lb/>• For broadband financing. <lb/> • To issue guidance for local and regional authorities on the use of European Union funds for <lb/>broadband project design and preparation. <lb/> • To adopt investment guidelines on broadband for local and regional authorities to facilitate full <lb/>absorption of European Union funds.<lb/>The European Commission also committed itself to: <lb/>• Complete a review of cost-reduction practices [for NGA deployment] by 2012. <lb/> • Reinforce and rationalise the use of funding of high-speed broadband through European Union <lb/>instruments under the current financial framework (e.g. the European Regional Development Fund <lb/>(ERDF), the Eastern Recovery Development Programme (ERDP), the European Agricultural Fund <lb/>for Rural Development (EAFRD), the Trans-European Networks (TEN) and the Competitiveness <lb/>and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) by end 2013.<lb/>In turn, the European Commission asks that its Member States: <lb/>• Set national broadband targets and adopt operational plans that are in line with the European <lb/>broadband target; the European Commission will review the national plans in 2011, <lb/> • Take national actions to reduce broadband investment costs.<lb/>Taken as a whole, the European public policy position is seeking to ensure that NGA and especially <lb/>FTTH are facilitated by lowering deployment costs, making finance available and co-ordinating <lb/>information and operators. However, while the reliance in Europe on competitive dynamics in the market <lb/>to be the main driver of FTTH/B deployment remains, there is renewed emphasis now on the need for <lb/>publicly funded investment beyond areas where competition is viable. <lb/>It is also clear within Europe that those countries that are making the most progress are precisely those <lb/>countries where physical access based competition is strongest. <lb/>Figure 3 below shows the retail share of broadband of alternative providers. In Europe different <lb/>access products are available as a means of delivering services to end users, with those access products <lb/>being on a scale between bitstream and full ULL. Figure 4 below shows the number of broadband lines <lb/>based on full ULL. Full ULL allows an entrant to build its own network by buying the economies of scale <lb/>available to the incumbent (by renting local loops at cost). Where entrants enjoy a high share of the retail <lb/>market and that share is principally based on full ULL, it is fair to conclude that that represents situations <lb/>where access competition is strongest, subject to two caveats. The first concerns the presence of cable <lb/>networks which tends to be stronger in Northern Europe and weaker in the South. The second concerns <lb/>Eastern Europe where self supply (new network construction) is often preferred, facilitated by lighter <lb/>planning requirements. <lb/></body>

			<body>Many of these initiatives are seeking to use public finance as a catalyst for private sector investment <lb/>in more marginal areas. Portugal represents a good example of such a project where the regulator has <lb/>divided the country into two regions, competitive and non-competitive. Currently, in the competitive <lb/>region operators will have regulated access to civil engineering (passive) infrastructure and the main <lb/>operators are obliged to deploy their own networks. In the non-competitive areas, where there is currently <lb/>no other basic broadband infrastructure than the network of the incumbent operator, the State is seeking to <lb/>accelerate a single NGN shared infrastructure open to all operators, through a series of tenders. In the <lb/>remaining non-competitive areas, regulated unbundled fibre access and fibre bitstream access are options <lb/>that might be imposed by the regulator following market analysis. <lb/>The Australian investment is the most ambitious public intervention in the OECD, with the Australian <lb/>Federal Government&apos;s plan to build a National Broadband Network (NBN) with fibre-to-the-premises <lb/>(FTTP) technologies delivering broadband to 93% of homes with an investment of up to USD 43 billion. <lb/>In most OECD countries, private-led investment is the main vehicle for achieving a transition from <lb/>copper-based networks to networks which are primarily FTTH/B. <lb/>In addition to government-level interventions a great many local investments are taking place, often <lb/>by energy utilities with large infrastructural project experience, sometimes with and sometimes without <lb/>public financial support. One striking feature of FTTH/B deployments is the observation that a large <lb/>number of local initiatives of different shapes and sizes where consumers, although willing to pay for <lb/>FTTH access, cannot elicit supply through traditional means. Since their demand is not being met in the <lb/>market, consumers are obliged to revert to a model which seeks supply from non-traditional sources. Two <lb/>such examples, one in Sweden and one in the United States, are described below. <lb/>Mälarenergi Stadsnät -Västerås, Sweden <lb/>In 2000, the city of Västerås in Sweden, with a population of 130 000, decided to build an open-access fiber optic <lb/>network. The city tasked its power utility, Mälarenergi, with the responsibility of building and operating the network. <lb/>Mälarenergi, in turn, created a subsidiary: Mälarenergi Stadsnät (The &quot; Malar Energy City Network &quot; ) or MSN. The <lb/>financing of local access was a shared responsibility with the home owners involved. The price of access was set at <lb/>USD 3 900 for an SDU, while MDU prices were set at USD 429, reflecting the different costs involved. The topology is <lb/>PtP and the network was sold as an open-access network which any service provider could then contract directly with <lb/>end users. Benefits identified to end users included: increased home valuations, radically improved service quality and <lb/>competitive prices for ongoing services. In practice, for users taking telephony and a 100Mbs broadband connection <lb/>service the estimated return on investment was as little as 4 years. <lb/>Utopia Network, Utah, United States <lb/>A similar initiative in the United States concerns an attempt by 16 Utah cities to provide FTTH infrastructure to their <lb/>residents. The local power utility has been used as the vechicle to roll-out and manage the infrastructure. Residents <lb/>pay for the local access connection through payments added to their utility bills, spread over a number of instalments. <lb/>Recently, public funding through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was allocated in order to allow <lb/>connection of nearly 400 schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community college <lb/>locations, government offices and other important community institutions in sections of Perry, Payson, Midvale, <lb/>Murray, Centerville, Layton, Orem, and West Valley City. In turn, the extended reach of the network will give more <lb/>private residents the option to connect to the extended network. <lb/>As noted earlier, Sweden has shown that that these small initiatives can scale-up with perhaps as <lb/>much as 40% of Swedish deployments falling into such a category. The European Commission for its part <lb/>believes that Europe can scale-up local initiatives with the support of public finance and publicly funded <lb/>investment mechanisms such as the EIB. 14 <lb/></body>

			<body>The topologies of the FTTH/B networks being deployed <lb/>The topology of deployment has a determinative impact on the form of competitive access that can be <lb/>achieved on FTTH/B networks. In terms of physical access remedies that could be imposed on a FTTH/B <lb/>network, only PtP deployments have the possibility to give physically unbundled access equivalent to the <lb/>kind historically available over the copper network. <lb/>In general end-to-end network competition is preferable to other forms of competition since <lb/>competitors compete over the entire value chain or access provision. End to end network operators enjoy <lb/>technical independence in all aspects of service provision, which is not a feature of virtual access solutions. <lb/>While parallel networks may exist independently of each other, they may also be created by renting loops. <lb/>One network can be shared by several physical network access operators and this can reduce inefficient <lb/>network duplication costs whilst still allowing the benefits of economies of scale to be available to the <lb/>market. Hence, many public policy makers that do not have sufficient existing network competitors to <lb/>ensure competitive retail conditions express a preference for PtP where it is feasible. Wavelength Division <lb/>Multiplexing (WDM) solutions have the possibility to deliver the benefits of a PtP access network over a <lb/>PtMP access network but they are mostly unproven and lack scale in the access network for the moment. <lb/>For PtMP topologies, the currently available access remedies are more limited. While in theory, and <lb/>indeed in practical deployment terms, it is possible to deploy multiple PtMP networks simultaneously <lb/>which would be managed by alternative operators, it is not obvious what incentives exist for such an <lb/>approach. <lb/>It is more likely that access remedies will need to be based on different forms of virtual access, either <lb/>forms of &apos;bitstream&apos; access or more advanced access products based on wavelength unbundling. These <lb/>access options are considered further in the following section of this report. <lb/>An assessment of Table 1 above indicates that 20 countries have PtP as the main topology, 11 with <lb/>PtMP and 1 which can only be classified as a mixture. In practice only 9 (4 PtMP and 5 PtP) of the 32 <lb/>countries have opted for one or other technology, whilst the other countries have opted for a mixture. <lb/>It should also be noted that the current picture may be distorted to some extent by the stage of network <lb/>development. As noted already, Europe lags some way behind other regions in terms of network <lb/>deployment for a variety of reasons. The early stage of FTTH\B deployment in Europe and indeed in <lb/>Australasia suggests that the currently identified topology may change in the not-too-distant future. A good <lb/>case in point is the United Kingdom where, to date, network deployment has been carried out mainly on <lb/>the basis of local initiatives and localised commercial deployments 15 . However, BT in the United Kingdom <lb/>has indicated that it will deploy 4 million FTTH/B lines in the coming years and that the topology will be <lb/>PtMP 16 . Such a deployment is likely to dwarf any other deployment in terms of size. <lb/>Similarly, Deutsche Telekom in Germany has announced its intention to deploy FTTH to 4 million <lb/>homes by 2012 and in Italy, a consortium of alternative operators have announced plans to deploy a further <lb/>(PtP) FTTH network in the principle 15 Italian cities or to about 4 million homes, also reinforcing the <lb/>existing deployment model. Telecom Italia at the same time has proposed a mixed PtMP and FTTN <lb/>deployment to about 50% of Italian homes at a cost of USD 11.8 billion so the final deployment mode <lb/>remains uncertain. <lb/>There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty particularly given the early stage of FTTH deployments <lb/>in Europe so that the European market could change quite radically in the coming years. Within Europe, <lb/>PtMP has increased from 15% to 17% 17 of all deployments and as incumbents, who to date have expressed <lb/></body>

			<body>a strong preference for PtMP deployment topologies, commence deployment, the share of PtMP can be <lb/>expected to accelerate rapidly. <lb/>It should be noted from the above that there is no strict correlation between topology and the nature <lb/>of the party deploying, which suggests that other factors are driving the commercial decision regarding <lb/>deployment technology. Each topology has advantages and disadvantages and countries have in general <lb/>given investing entities the freedom to choose their own preferred topology. <lb/>Table 4: Relative advantages of PtP and PtMP 18 : <lb/>PtMP <lb/>PtP <lb/>Future <lb/>Proof <lb/>Bandwidth <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>Symmetry <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>Geographical Reach <lb/>4 <lb/>4 <lb/>Reliability <lb/>4 <lb/>4 <lb/>Operational <lb/>Efficiency <lb/>4 <lb/>2 <lb/>Cost of Deployment <lb/>1 <lb/>0 <lb/>Competitive Access <lb/>1 <lb/>4 <lb/>Table 4 above seeks to set out some of the basic elements under consideration and to try to weigh the <lb/>relative advantages of each on a scale from 0 to 4. In general, PtP is more future proof but PtMP is often <lb/>cheaper 19 to install and run. In areas with low population densities, where overhead network deployment is <lb/>often a feature, these cost differences can be even more pronounced. Competitive access products are <lb/>better on a PtP network and future network management can be achieved under more competitive <lb/>conditions. The incremental costs of choosing between building PtMP and PtP vary but seem to range <lb/>between 5% and 15% while the additional cost of deploying multiple PtMP networks simultaneously <lb/>seems to be in the same range 20 . <lb/>Nevertheless, it is a fact that the competitive access options today are much more limited when a <lb/>PtMP topology is deployed. This assessment may change as technologies develop and improve. The <lb/>various access options and practices are discussed in more detail in the following section. <lb/>Accommodating competitive access <lb/>Regulatory responses <lb/>In the European Union a series of documents released in 2010 have sought to clarify the mode of <lb/>regulation for fibre and to outline, or request Member States of the European Union to outline, their <lb/>broadband plans for reaching certain predefined targets. In particular, the Recommendation on NGA seeks <lb/>to clarify the terms for private investors investing in fibre-based networks in Europe. That document seeks <lb/>to smooth the transition from copper to fibre based networks. In relation to existing copper network based <lb/>competitors, the Recommendation sets out the migration regime and sets minimum conditions for <lb/>migration from copper-based wholesale products to fibre ones. <lb/>The umbrella Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications of the European Union <lb/>(BEREC), an advisory body to the European Commission, conducted a comprehensive survey of the <lb/>access products available in a FTTH/B context. As part of that exercise, a simplified and stylised ladder of <lb/>investment for NGA products was identified which is depicted in Figure 5 below, some of these elements <lb/></body>

			<body>may be merged together or further split, depending upon a national solution, therefore a concentration <lb/>point can be the same as a cabinet: <lb/>Figure 5: NGA ladder of investment <lb/>Source: BEREC : BoR (10) 08 BEREC Report on NGA wholesale products. <lb/>The architecture of a fibre network differs from that of a copper one. Current generation broadband in <lb/>Europe, as elsewhere, is often supplied by competitors who have built out to the incumbent&apos;s local <lb/>exchange, where they rent local loops. That point may disappear in a fibre network, being replaced with <lb/>different exchange points in a PtP network, while in a PtMP network unbundling the fibre loop in a manner <lb/>similar to unbundling copper loops is difficult or impossible. Regulators need to devise strategies which <lb/>will permit the transition of competition on FTTH/B networks to go ahead. <lb/>In a PtP network, it is possible to unbundle the network in more or less the same fashion as on a <lb/>copper network. Some issues have arisen about how large an optical distribution frame (ODF) needs to be <lb/>in order to credibly be able to host one or more competitors. Certain national regulators 21 have specified <lb/>minimum criteria in respect of ODF size and guidance may also be proffered regarding the location of <lb/>access points. <lb/>In Japan and the Netherlands fibre loop unbundling regimes are in place. In Europe, while PtP is the <lb/>dominant deployment technology to date, it is frequently deployed by entrant operators rather than the <lb/>(normally) dominant incumbent implying that access obligations will not arise. <lb/>In the United States unbundling decisions and regulatory forbearance have generally eliminated <lb/>regulated access to fibre and in Korea regulatory forbearance for fibre investments exists since 2004. <lb/>As noted already, incumbent operators are opting more and more for PtMP-type topologies. They are <lb/>not alone and while some entrants 22 have opted for PtMP deployments so too has the Australian <lb/>Government. In general, therefore, a very significant proportion of access obligations within the OECD <lb/></body>

			<body>will be based on PtMP networks. Since physical unbundling is virtually impossible on such networks, <lb/>regulators need to consider the scope for virtual access remedies to replace physical unbundling. <lb/>Regarding PtMP networks, two broad types of virtual access products can be identified. The first is <lb/>wavelength unbundling -often referred to as &quot;wave division multiplexing (WDM)&quot;. As its name suggests, <lb/>WDM involved splitting the lightwave into its constituent colours (with many shades of primary colours <lb/>being possible). Once split, the individual wavelengths can then be allocated to different services or <lb/>operators. In this sense lightwave unbundling could allow multiple operators full control of a wavelength <lb/>without access to the physical fibre. From a technical independence perspective, this form of unbundling is <lb/>likely to give access seekers a degree of independence comparable to physical unbundling. <lb/>WDM in the fibre access loop is a technology which is established but has not been standardised and <lb/>perhaps more tellingly, has not reached any level of scale economies. In its assessment of the various <lb/>technical options for FTTH roll-out in the United Kingdom. 23 Analysys Mason found that WDM had the <lb/>least favourable economic profile of the different deployment options. There remains uncertainty about <lb/>how significant scale economies for active network components will be in the future for WDM, but if <lb/>significant, these results could change. <lb/>In 2010, WDM usage is very limited but it holds out the exciting prospect of technical independence <lb/>for access seekers on a single infrastructure and the ability to take access relatively high in the network <lb/>(i.e. further away from the end-user). This should allow viable entry with larger numbers of addressable <lb/>consumers at access points. The possibility is that once WDM technology matures, light-wave unbundling <lb/>may be functionally equivalent to physical unbundling holds out the best future hope for competitive <lb/>access seekers on PtMP networks. It may be that networks built with a PtMP topology might be more, or <lb/>less, capable of upgrading to a network which can support a WDM solution 24 . <lb/>The second main access product that can be envisioned on PtMP network topologies is a <lb/>bitstream-type access product. Ofcom in the United Kingdom has required 25 a bitstream product Virtual <lb/>Unbundled Local Access (VULA) provide access seekers a wholesale product that allows a degree of <lb/>control similar to that achieved in local loop unbundling as physical access is not possible. RTR in Austria <lb/>made a comparable proposal more or less at the same time 26 . While both proposals raised comments from <lb/>the European Commission about the need to move to unbundling as soon as the technology enabling fibre <lb/>unbundling is available, both were considered appropriate as transitory measures. Regulators need to <lb/>ensure that by introducing virtual solutions due to the limitations for physical competition, they do not <lb/>become embedded in the regulatory approach rather than be transitory arrangements. Otherwise, with a <lb/>move to fibre, the entrant community may face a step (or half-step) back down the &quot;ladder of <lb/>investment&quot;&apos; 27 where they have built out their own networks on the basis of ULL but will be forced to <lb/>move back along the value chain and accept bitstream and bitstream variants in the future. <lb/>Market developments <lb/>In choosing the appropriate form of regulation, there are trade-offs at two levels. The first level <lb/>concerns choosing between network duplication costs and dynamic efficiency. If the access market is <lb/>viewed from a static perspective, building multiple networks increases the costs of delivery significantly. <lb/>The additional costs incurred can be viewed as costly and inefficient where each network delivers the same <lb/>basic services. <lb/>From a more dynamic perspective, multiple networks will compete vigorously with each other and <lb/>will ensure that any inefficiency is competed away on the individual networks and that innovation will be <lb/>important as network operators seek to differentiate themselves from each other. <lb/></body>

			<body>In the past, the costs of duplicating copper-based networks, or PSTN, were so high that considerations <lb/>of dynamic efficiency rarely arose. However, since the topology of copper networks was universally PtP, <lb/>in practice the efficiencies of building a single network single network build and the benefits of multiple <lb/>competing networks, could be achieved simultaneously (through ULL). With technological evolution and <lb/>convergence, cable networks also found themselves competing with traditional PSTN -and with the <lb/>evolution of DSL, the PSTN could in turn compete with cable networks. Where competition is strongest <lb/>between platforms and within platforms, product innovation and take up have been markedly better than <lb/>where limited or no access competition has existed. <lb/>Where PtMP topologies are deployed the more optimum solution of sharing a single build network to <lb/>achieve multiple competing end-to-end networks is not generally cost effective today. Therefore policy <lb/>makers require a view of how large the costs of deployment will be (and can they be made smaller) and <lb/>how large the benefits of dynamic efficiency will be. By facilitating the sharing of passive infrastructures <lb/>and the co-ordination of investments where appropriate, policy makers can lower replication costs and <lb/>encourage infrastructure-based competition and investment. There is significantly more scope for end-to-<lb/>end competition emerging in a FTTH/B context than existed in a copper world. However, achieving such a <lb/>competitive roll-out is not obvious. <lb/>Allowing access to passive infrastructure and sharing certain network elements (such as in-building <lb/>wiring) can greatly facilitate entry. Co-ordinating and facilitating co-operative roll-outs can also <lb/>significantly enhance the possibilities for end-to-end competition. <lb/>However, it is clear that investment incentives are also coloured by the alternative access regimes. <lb/>Most European regulators that have fibre deployments have signalled that regulated bitstream products are <lb/>either not available over the new infrastructure 28 or such availability is limited at least for the moment, so <lb/>as to preserve entrants&apos; incentives to invest (particularly when facing a PtMP deployment). Those <lb/>regulators that judge the scope for infrastructure based competition to be very limited have opted to try and <lb/>develop bitstream products ahead of time 29 . Policy makers therefore seek to protect competition in the <lb/>market but in doing so must take a forward-looking view on the market developments and make trade-offs <lb/>on access products where necessary. The appropriate policy response is further complicated by the fact <lb/>that, even under optimal conditions, competitive roll-outs are likely to be relatively limited in their <lb/>geographic scope and indeed, many countries have to deal with less than optimal conditions. The <lb/>implication therefore is that some virtual access products will be needed in order to avoid re-<lb/>monopolisation of significant parts of the market. Therefore geographic limitation of remedies is becoming <lb/>more prominent over time. <lb/>In countries where a PtP deployment is taking place, that singular infrastructure allows many <lb/>operators to build their own networks by renting the fibre loops and adding their own network elements. In <lb/>countries where a PtMP topology is being deployed this option is not available and the choice will be <lb/>between multiple parallel networks and competition based on virtual remedies. Unless there is a credible <lb/>threat of alternative, competing investments, the incentives for incumbent operators to move first are weak. <lb/>This in turn suggests that, absent competitive pressure, incumbents may choose to delay the <lb/>installation of fibre even when investment in a fibre network has a positive expected net present value as <lb/>compared with maintaining the copper network in place. This is because delaying the fibre until <lb/>uncertainties about execution, demand and regulation are removed has an option value to the investor from <lb/>which it has to be bought out for the investment to go ahead. <lb/>In order to restore incentives, regulators could commit to access pricing policies which encourage <lb/>investment by competitors. A problem with such an approach is that the pricing of wholesale products can <lb/>change quickly and that regulators have often reneged on commitments to withdraw access products or <lb/></body>

			<body>worsen the terms on which they are available. 30 Often, a more fundamental problem arises when <lb/>competitors on the market do not hold a sufficient scale to make large scale investments credible. Strong <lb/>competitors on today&apos;s networks give policy makers greater opportunities in terms of stimulating an <lb/>investment dynamic. <lb/>From a demand perspective, service development, innovation and above all pricing of fibre-based <lb/>access products are likely to be critical to take-up. A number of market analysts have identified the take-up <lb/>rate of fibre as being of far greater importance than the prices charged when assessing payback periods. <lb/>The relationships between prices, take-up and payback periods are non-linear, i.e. a percentage increase in <lb/>take-up rates leads to a several percentage points decrease in price (holding the payback period constant). <lb/>Figure 6 below from Yankee Group depicts their assessment of the relationship between prices, take-<lb/>up rates and the time needed for investment payback. This suggests that ensuring a competitive <lb/>environment is not only the best way of justifying the investments but is also likely to drive outcomes of <lb/>lower prices and higher take-up beneficial to consumers, ensuring shorter payback periods for investors. <lb/>Figure 6: Discounted FTTH payback (w. USD 1000/home costs, 45% cash margin and 12.5% WACC) <lb/>Source: Source: Yankee Group, 2009. <lb/>Therefore, an access model which seeks to ensure cheaper access rates is likely to see higher take-up <lb/>which becomes self sustaining. A higher take-up not only facilitates a more rapid transition to FTTH/B but <lb/>also the retirement of the copper network. <lb/></body>

			<body>Policy suggestions or guidance based on the results of the research <lb/>The evidence to date suggests several points of guidance for policy makers. First, while an equation <lb/>seeking to explain the adoption of FTTH/B solutions would have many explanatory variables it is normally <lb/>preceded by strong broadband take-up. Broadband take-up is normally best in dynamic markets with strong <lb/>competition with more than two fixed network competitors. Competition on the physical access network <lb/>(whether via ULL, based on cable/other networks or both) is a key requirement to facilitate broadband <lb/>take-up. This suggests that regulation that ensures competitive markets is as important as ever if FTTH/B is <lb/>to be achieved. Once FTTH/B is deployed, ensuring take-up, usage, innovation and consumer outcomes <lb/>generally, will all benefit from more competitive markets. <lb/>Second, competition can drive FTTH/B in certain settings but is unlikely to deliver FTTH/B <lb/>universally, implying that some subsequent government intervention will be needed to deliver FTTH/B <lb/>outside commercial areas. Significant positive externalities can justify such interventions 31 . However, it is <lb/>important that public interventions do not interfere with or indeed forestall private investment. Policy <lb/>makers who clearly specify when and where they will intervene can minimise these risks. <lb/>Third, public finance given to encourage FTTH/B rollouts should have open access requirements. <lb/>Consistent with maintaining incentives to invest, policy makers should seek to ensure that the best access <lb/>options are available on future access networks where they can influence the outcomes. <lb/>Fourth, FTTH deployment is expensive and choosing the right technology is best left to market <lb/>players to decide in national circumstances. However, physical access products available today on PtMP <lb/>networks are inferior to those available on PtP networks. PtMP networks that anticipate, by installing <lb/>splitters that allow multiple frequencies through, an upgrade to WDM at the point of deployment, can be <lb/>upgraded much more readily than networks that do not. <lb/>Fifth, countries hoping to achieve a radical improvement in FTTH/B deployment should consider <lb/>measures to improve access competition on current networks. The evidence suggests that not only is this <lb/>important in terms of stimulating investment, it is also critical to ensuring a strong take-up of the network <lb/>once it is available, which in turn will allow shutting down parallel networks in a timely fashion. <lb/>Finally, countries should take all reasonable measures to lower deployment costs by ensuring <lb/>information transparency on network evolution, setting out clearly migration paths to new access products <lb/>and by giving access to existing passive infrastructures, streamlining building permits and co-ordination of <lb/>investments. <lb/></body>
