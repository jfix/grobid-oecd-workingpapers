			<head>.............................................................. 29<lb/> Executive summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently<lb/> preparing intended nationally determined contributions for the post-2020 period, as part of the new climate<lb/> change agreement to be adopted at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 21) in<lb/> Paris in 2015. The reporting and accounting 1 framework for these post-2020 nationally determined<lb/> contributions has yet to be agreed. An important part of this reporting and accounting framework will be<lb/> how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land use<lb/> (AFOLU, hereafter referred to as the &quot; land sector &quot; ) are treated.<lb/> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that anthropogenic GHG emissions<lb/> from the land sector are currently around 10-12 GtCO 2 -eq per year – the second largest source of<lb/> anthropogenic GHG emissions after the energy sector. Further, non-CO 2 emissions from agricultural<lb/> activities such as enteric fermentation in livestock, manure management, rice cultivation and agricultural<lb/> soils now exceed CO 2 emissions from deforestation and other land use changes. Mitigation and adaptation<lb/> in the land sector are therefore essential if the goal to limit the rise in global average temperature to below<lb/> 2 °C above pre-industrial levels is to stay within reach, and the worst impacts avoided.<lb/> Several sets of arrangements currently exist for reporting and accounting of anthropogenic GHG emissions<lb/> and removals from the land sector. These include reporting via GHG inventories under the Convention,<lb/> reporting and accounting for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities by Annex B<lb/> Parties 2 under the Kyoto Protocol (KP), and recognition of reduced emissions from deforestation, forest<lb/> degradation and related activities (REDD+) in developing countries. Under the KP, special accounting<lb/> rules have been established for LULUCF activities while non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture are treated<lb/> the same way as other inventory categories for national accounting purposes. Project-level reporting and<lb/> accounting methodologies have also been developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)<lb/> and by the voluntary carbon markets.<lb/> The LULUCF part of the land sector has some special features that distinguish it from other sectors such as<lb/> agriculture, energy, transport, industry and waste. It is particularly difficult to separate anthropogenic from<lb/> natural emissions and removals for LULUCF. The effects of past management decisions can have a<lb/> particularly strong influence on emissions and removals from forests, since they determine the age-class<lb/> structure and harvesting cycles of forests – this is known as the &quot; legacy effect &quot; . Removals of CO 2 by<lb/> vegetation and soils are not necessarily permanent, and reversals can be triggered by natural disturbances<lb/> or human activities. Further, uncertainties tend to be high and some of the emissions are the result of<lb/> essential activities such as food production. Consequently, the existing reporting and accounting<lb/> arrangements are complex, not applicable to all Parties, and provide limited flexibility for pursuing more<lb/> cost-effective accounting approaches that would enable developing countries to address potentially<lb/> conflicting policy objectives such as addressing climate change while increasing agricultural output.<lb/> Possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting are presented in this<lb/> paper. The vision is of a multi-dimensional land sector reporting and accounting framework that is<lb/> applicable to all countries and increases in comprehensiveness over time. The long-term vision builds on<lb/> the conclusions of other recent studies in this area and respects the special features of the LUCUF part of<lb/> the land sector outlined above. The overarching objective of the reporting and accounting framework is to<lb/> 1<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper, reporting refers to the measurement and reporting of information on GHG emissions and<lb/> removals, and is largely technical in nature. Accounting refers to what counts towards the achievement of<lb/> mitigation commitments and how implementation of commitments is tracked, and is more political in<lb/> nature.<lb/></p>

			<head>7<lb/></head>

			<p>build trust between Parties by tracking progress in implementation of mitigation contributions in the land<lb/> sector. The possible elements identified are:<lb/></p>

			<head>Generic elements (relevant to all sectors)<lb/></head>

			<p>• Use of IPCC 2006 Guidelines by all Parties (with flexibility for least developed countries and<lb/> small island developing states) to measure and report information on key sources and sinks, with<lb/> different Parties using different tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity.<lb/> • Increasing quality and accuracy of reporting for land sector sources and sinks (i.e. using higher<lb/> IPCC tiers for key categories where possible).<lb/> • Provision of up-front information alongside intended nationally determined contributions that<lb/> promotes transparency, clarity and understanding.<lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of<lb/> different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances<lb/> and capacities of countries.<lb/> • Focus on cost-effective reporting and accounting.<lb/> • Recognition of need for means of implementation to increase reporting and accounting capacity<lb/> in developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Land-specific elements (relevant to the land sector only)<lb/></head>

			<p>• Increasing coverage over successive cycles of nationally determined contributions for accounting<lb/> for anthropogenic sources and sinks (with existing accounting of non-CO 2 emissions from<lb/> agriculture to continue for Annex B Parties).<lb/> • Provisions to address age-class structure effects in forests and the risk of natural disturbances and<lb/> reversals of sequestered carbon from forests and other land sinks.<lb/> • Use of a &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule for coverage of sources and sinks.<lb/> • Accommodate mitigation contributions expressed relative to reference levels or using intensity<lb/> metrics relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective<lb/> accounting options that take into account national circumstances.<lb/> • Technical assessment of reference levels where appropriate to increase confidence in the baselines<lb/> against which progress is tracked.<lb/> • Reporting of qualitative information on a Parties&apos; vision for the land sector and the multiple<lb/> benefits of policies and environmental and social safeguards (where applicable), to complement<lb/> the quantitative accounting framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>The long-term vision can be depicted as a multi-dimensional matrix, with various dimensions for reporting<lb/> and accounting. Two of the most important dimensions could be the coverage of accounting for key<lb/> sources and sinks and the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting (<ref type="figure">Figure</ref> ES.1). Parties could<lb/> agree shared direction of travel for all Parties over time, in terms of increasing the coverage of accounting<lb/> for key sources and sinks and increasing the quality and accuracy of data used for accounting. Countries in<lb/> a position to do so would be expected to advance over time towards higher IPCC tier approaches for<lb/> estimating emissions or removals from key categories.<lb/> Countries with low capacity for measuring and reporting could start by reporting GHG emissions from key<lb/> sources and sinks using the IPCC Tier 1 approach, which is the simplest approach and uses default<lb/> emissions factors. Increasing use of country-specific emissions factors and remote sensing technologies<lb/> and other techniques could help to increase the accuracy of land sector data. Capacity building would be<lb/> needed to assist low-capacity countries to increase their reporting and accounting coverage over time.<lb/> Figure ES.1: A shared direction of travel for land sector accounting<lb/> This paper outlines possible short-term steps for COP 20, COP 21 and 2016-2020 that could put Parties on<lb/> a pathway towards realising the long-term vision. Some Parties may choose to include mitigation (and<lb/> potentially also adaptation) actions in the land sector as components of their intended nationally<lb/> determined contributions under the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action<lb/> (ADP). The nationally determined contributions that Parties choose to put forward could include economy-<lb/>wide contributions covering the land sector, sector-specific goals, goals relative to baselines or reference<lb/> levels, project-level actions, and individual policies and measures. At COP 20, Parties could agree to create<lb/> a formal work stream to discuss post-2020 land sector accounting issues, and decide the up-front<lb/> information to be provided alongside land sector contributions.<lb/> At COP 21 in 2015, a set of foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting could be<lb/> agreed that put Parties on a pathway towards the possible long-term vision outlined above. The foundations<lb/> for reporting could include agreement by all parties to use IPCC 2006 Guidelines for reporting GHG<lb/> inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals. The foundations for accounting could include:<lb/> agreement to expand the coverage of land sector accounting over time, with a view to achieving broad<lb/> coverage of key categories of anthropogenic sources and sinks in the land sector in all countries; that the<lb/> &quot; once in, always in &quot; accounting rule is to be applied in the post-2020 period; that both emissions and<lb/> removals are to be accounted for; and that there are to be technical assessments of reference levels (where<lb/> called for by the type of contribution or as part of technical corrections, e.g. for age-class effects in forests)<lb/> to increase confidence and build trust.<lb/> Elaboration of technical details relating to the land sector reporting and accounting framework could be<lb/> undertaken in the period 2016-2020. Issues remaining to be addressed after COP 21 could include: the<lb/> possible development of guidance for reference levels and intensity-based approaches for agriculture, as<lb/> ways to deal with legacy effects and address multiple policy objectives; treatment of removals due to<lb/> natural disturbances or indirect human effects; the approach to be used for identifying anthropogenic GHG<lb/> emissions and removals; and the potential role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms.<lb/> Quality and<lb/> accuracy of<lb/> data used for<lb/> accounting<lb/> Coverage of accounting for<lb/> key sources and sinks<lb/> Broad<lb/> Narrow<lb/> High IPCC tiers<lb/> Low IPCC tiers<lb/></table>

			<p>Millions of people in rural communities also depend on agriculture and forestry for their livelihoods.<lb/> Therefore in addition to the accounting system, which focuses on tracking progress towards quantitative<lb/> mitigation commitments, Parties could be encouraged to develop and report qualitative information on<lb/> holistic landscape management strategies and benefits of actions in areas such as environmental and social<lb/> safeguards (as currently applied under the REDD+ framework), climate-smart agriculture, and ecosystem-<lb/>based adaptation. Consistent with their type of nationally determined contribution, Parties could also<lb/> choose to deal with these competing demands by focussing on efficiency or productivity, such as GHG<lb/> emissions per unit of agricultural output.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Land management faces significant challenges in the 21 st century. These include contributing to the global<lb/> mitigation effort needed to prevent dangerous climate change, while providing enough food for a<lb/> population of 9 billion by 2050 as well as shelter and livelihoods for rural populations and various<lb/> ecosystem services. Risk multipliers include increasing land degradation and perturbed cycles of nitrogen,<lb/> phosphorous and other nutrients, as well as growing water stress in many regions and other climate-related<lb/> impacts.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a constant, natural exchange of carbon between the land, the atmosphere and the oceans. For<lb/> hundreds of years human activities have interfered with this natural cycle resulting in a significant net<lb/> transfer of carbon from the land stock to the atmosphere and ocean. In addition to CO 2 emissions and<lb/> removals due to changes in land use, notably emissions from the clearing of forest land to make way for<lb/> agriculture or settlements, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions are produced by agricultural sources such as ruminant<lb/> livestock, manure, rice cultivation, agricultural soils and the burning of agricultural residues.<lb/> Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently negotiating a new<lb/> 2015 climate change agreement under the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced<lb/> Action (ADP). Many developed and developing countries may choose to include mitigation (and possibly<lb/> also adaptation) actions in the land sector as nationally determined contributions under the 2015<lb/> agreement. The negotiation of the 2015 agreement presents an opportunity to create &quot; an integrated<lb/> accounting and incentive framework for adaptation and mitigation strategies across all land uses &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Parker<lb/> et al., 2014</ref>). Such a reporting and accounting framework could improve comparability between the<lb/> information provided by countries regarding emissions and removals from the land sector, while retaining<lb/> flexibility to take into account national circumstances.<lb/> This paper focuses on land sector reporting and accounting 3 in the context of the UNFCCC and has two<lb/> aims. The first aim is to lay out possible elements of a long-term vision for the post-2020 reporting and<lb/> accounting framework for emissions and removals from the land sector, building on existing experience<lb/> with reporting and accounting as well as previous studies. The second aim is to identify possible steps that<lb/> could be taken at <ref type="biblio">COP 20 in 2014, COP 21 in 2015, and in 2016-2020</ref> to put Parties on a pathway towards<lb/> realising this vision.<lb/> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global anthropogenic GHG<lb/> emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) currently total around 10-12 GtCO 2 -eq<lb/> per year, making it the second largest source of anthropogenic GHG emissions after the energy sector<lb/> (IPCC, 2014a). Further, non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture are rising rapidly and since the mid-2000s<lb/> they have been a greater GHG contributor than CO 2 emissions from deforestation (<ref type="biblio">Christ, 2014</ref>). In this<lb/> paper, the term &quot; land sector &quot; is used as shorthand to refer to the AFOLU sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are currently several sets of arrangements for reporting and accounting for land sector emissions and<lb/> removals. The IPCC has developed GHG inventory methods that treat the land sector coherently and are<lb/> used for reporting to the UNFCCC. Under the Kyoto Protocol (KP), Annex B Parties 4 account for<lb/> agriculture and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities, although accounting remains<lb/> voluntary for some LULUCF activities. A work stream on reducing emissions from deforestation and<lb/> forest degradation and associated activities (REDD+) in developing countries has been established under<lb/> 3<lb/></p>

			<p>The IPCC defines accounting as &quot; the rules for comparing emissions and removals as reported with<lb/> commitments &quot; (IPCC, 2000).<lb/> the UNFCCC. However, developing countries have not so far had international emissions limitation or<lb/> reduction commitments under the UNFCCC or Kyoto Protocol and therefore anthropogenic emissions and<lb/> removals from agriculture, forestry and other land use in developing countries remain largely unaccounted<lb/> for. Further, accurate measurement of emissions and removals from the land sector can be difficult and<lb/> some of the emissions are the result of essential activities such as food production – a particularly sensitive<lb/> policy area in many developing countries.<lb/> Section 2 provides background information on recent relevant studies, existing arrangements for land<lb/> sector reporting and accounting and special features of the land sector. Section 3 outlines possible elements<lb/> of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting that builds on existing approaches. Section 4<lb/> lays out possible short-term steps that could be taken over the coming years in the UNFCCC negotiations<lb/> to lay the foundations for the long-term vision. Section 5 concludes. A discussion of the finance,<lb/> technology and capacity building tools needed to support land sector mitigation and adaptation in<lb/> developing countries is important but beyond the scope of this paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Background<lb/> 2.1 Recent studies on post-2020 land sector accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>Several studies examining post-2020 land sector accounting have recently been published. A selection of<lb/> these are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The possible elements of a long-term vision outlined in this paper build<lb/> upon common aspects of these studies where possible.<lb/></p>

			<head>Options and Elements<lb/> for an Accounting<lb/> Framework for the<lb/> Land Sector in the<lb/> Post-2020 Climate<lb/> Regime<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper lays out various options for a future accounting framework with a strong<lb/> focus on lessons learned from existing experience and new emerging accounting<lb/> systems. The paper calls for a holistic approach to AFOLU accounting, with<lb/> fungibility between AFOLU and other sectors, full carbon accounting on all lands,<lb/> and a focus on creating incentives to promote good land management practices.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Estrada et al.<lb/> (2014)<lb/></ref> Land Use in a Future<lb/> Climate Agreement<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper presents the special features of the land sector, such as the legacy effect,<lb/> non-permanence, natural disturbances and measurement uncertainties, and discusses<lb/> how those features could be addressed in the 2015 agreement. It lays out different<lb/> options for the form of land sector contributions as well as options for incentives,<lb/> both monetary and non-monetary, to increase the ambition of land sector<lb/> contributions.<lb/> Hood, Briner<lb/> and Rocha<lb/> (2014)<lb/></p>

			<head>GHG or not GHG:<lb/> Accounting for Diverse<lb/> Mitigation<lb/> Contributions in the<lb/> Post-2020 Climate<lb/> Framework<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper contains a chapter describing possible options for a more comprehensive<lb/> land sector accounting system, including a KP activity-based approach, a UNFCCC<lb/> land-based approach, a &quot; reference levels for all &quot; approach, and &quot; agreement on<lb/> principles &quot; for land sector accounting. It also explores how the concept of bounded<lb/> flexibility could be applied to the land sector and identifies elements needed for the<lb/> construction of reference levels.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Iversen et al.<lb/> (2014)<lb/></ref> Understanding Land<lb/> Use in the UNFCCC<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing arrangements for the land<lb/> sector, including reporting and accounting under the Convention and the KP,<lb/> REDD+, CDM and Joint Implementation (JI) accounting, as well as treatment of<lb/> natural disturbances, harvested wood products, and social and environmental<lb/> safeguards.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Parker et al.<lb/> (2014)<lb/></ref> The Land-Use Sector<lb/> within the Post-2020<lb/> Climate Regime<lb/></head>

			<p>This paper examines four options for post-2020 land sector contributions: national<lb/> economy-wide targets; national or sub-national sectoral baselines; project-level<lb/> sectoral baselines; and policies and measures. It calls for an integrated approach to<lb/> mitigation and adaptation strategies in the land sector, as well as the convergence of<lb/> LULUCF, REDD+ and agriculture accounting to create a set of harmonised,<lb/> coherent policies on land use.<lb/> 12<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Existing arrangements for land sector reporting and accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>There are currently several systems for land sector reporting and accounting. These include: reporting for<lb/> anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals under the Convention; reporting and accounting for LULUCF<lb/> activities for Annex B Parties under the Kyoto Protocol; measurement, reporting and verification for<lb/> afforestation, reforestation and agriculture projects in developing countries via the Clean Development<lb/> Mechanism (CDM) as well as voluntary carbon markets; recognition for REDD+ activities in developing<lb/> countries; and arrangements for emission reduction targets for developed countries and nationally<lb/> appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) for developing countries under the Cancun Agreements.<lb/></p>

			<p>The unique features of the land sector, such as natural disturbances and the risk of crediting or debiting<lb/> non-anthropogenic outcomes, make it difficult to design a simple accounting system for this sector. For<lb/> example, most but not all LULUCF activities can be accounted for by Annex B Parties under the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol – some activities are mandatory, some are voluntary, some accounting rules depend on decisions<lb/> taken in the previous commitment period, and different types of baseline are used for different activities.<lb/> There are currently separate sets of arrangements for Annex B Parties and other Parties and there is no<lb/> international accounting framework that is applicable to all Parties. This makes it difficult to estimate the<lb/> aggregate impact of mitigation actions being undertaken in the land sector in different countries. Further,<lb/> the existing accounting arrangements provide selected coverage of emissions and removals from the land<lb/> sector (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The existing accounting arrangements therefore do not necessarily provide recognition for<lb/> the full range of mitigation opportunities available in the land sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>The existing arrangements for reporting and accounting in the land sector are outlined below. Convergence<lb/> of the existing separate arrangements could eventually result in an accounting framework for the land<lb/> sector that is applicable to all Parties and provides recognition for a diverse range of actions to tackle<lb/> climate change in the land sector.<lb/></p>

Annex I Parties currently provide annual inventories of<lb/> anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals from agriculture and all managed lands. These include<lb/> common reporting format (CRF) tables containing quantitative information on emissions and removals, as<lb/> well as national inventory reports (NIRs) containing qualitative information on emissions trends and data<lb/> collection methods and systems. Annex B Parties (a sub-set of Annex I Parties) are required to provide<lb/> supplementary information relating to their commitments in national communications, CRF tables (for<lb/> information on GHG emissions and removals) and standard electronic format (SEF) tables (for information<lb/> on GHG units).<lb/> There are separate reporting requirements for non-Annex I Parties under the Convention. Non-Annex I<lb/> Parties are to report GHG inventories as part of biennial update reports and national communications,<lb/> which are to be provided every four years subject to availability of support. Non-Annex I Parties shall, to<lb/> the extent possible, estimate anthropogenic emissions and removals of CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O in their GHG<lb/> inventories, and are encouraged to report information on emissions of HFCs, PF 6 and other GHGs as<lb/> appropriate (UNFCCC, 2002). For non-Annex I countries pursuing REDD+ activities 5 there are additional<lb/> reporting requirements, including information on proposed forest reference emissions levels and how<lb/> safeguards are being addressed and respected.<lb/></table>

			<p>GHG inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals from energy, transport, industry, waste and<lb/> AFOLU are reported by Parties in accordance with IPCC guidelines. The aim of the IPCC guidelines is to<lb/> ensure that GHG inventories are &quot; neither over nor under-estimates as far as can be judged &quot; (IPCC, 2000).<lb/> Further, uncertainties in the data are to be reduced as far as practicable. The use of these guidelines<lb/> enhances comparability and can help to provide robust and comparable data on emissions and removals<lb/> that can in turn provide a basis for accounting. The IPCC guidelines are developed over time with updated<lb/> guidelines and supplements.</p>

			<table>Table 4 summarises the IPCC guidance available to date specifically for the<lb/> land-related parts of GHG inventories. There are currently differences in the IPCC guidance recommended<lb/> for use by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Consistency between GHG inventories would be improved if<lb/> all Parties were use the IPCC 2006 Guidelines to prepare their inventories while using different IPCC tiers 6<lb/> for keys categories according to national capacities.<lb/> The IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories divide all land into six land categories. These categories are<lb/> forest land, cropland, grassland, settlements, wetlands and other land. A distinction is also made between<lb/> managed and unmanaged land, where managed land is defined as &quot; land where human interventions and<lb/> practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions &quot; (IPCC, 2006).<lb/> Conversions of managed land from one category to another are tracked. To compile the GHG inventory,<lb/> emissions and removals resulting from each land-use category are estimated, as well as emissions and<lb/> removals resulting from land-use changes. This approach is known as the &quot; land-based &quot; approach.<lb/> 5<lb/> Many non-Annex I countries are undertaking REDD+ activities with non-UNFCCC programmes that<lb/> support those activities, such as the UN-REDD Programme, the REDD+ Partnership, the Forest Investment<lb/> Program (FIP) and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).<lb/> 6<lb/> The IPCC tier approach represents a hierarchy of levels of methodological complexity (IPCC, 2006).<lb/> Higher tiers imply increased accuracy in the method or parameters used in the estimation of emissions and<lb/> removals. Tier 1 refers to the use of default data whereas Tier 2 implies the use of country-specific data.<lb/> Advanced methods and detailed country-specific data are applied within the Tier 3 approach. Higher tiers<lb/> are generally considered to be more accurate but can also imply higher uncertainties.

These were (UNFCCC, 2005):<lb/> a) That the treatment of these activities be based on sound science.<lb/> b) That consistent methodologies be used over time for the estimation and reporting of these<lb/> activities.<lb/> c) That the aim stated in Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Kyoto Protocol not be changed by accounting<lb/> for land use, land-use change and forestry activities.<lb/> d) That the mere presence of carbon stocks be excluded from accounting.<lb/> e) That the implementation of LULUCF activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity<lb/> and sustainable use of natural resources.<lb/> f) That accounting for LULUCF does not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment<lb/> period.<lb/> g) That reversal of any removal due to LULUCF activities be accounted for at the appropriate point<lb/> in time.<lb/> h) That accounting excludes removals resulting from: (i) elevated carbon dioxide concentrations<lb/> above their pre-industrial level; (ii) indirect nitrogen deposition; and (iii) the dynamic effects of<lb/> age structure resulting from activities and practices before the reference year.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Accounting for emissions and removals in the land sector in the context of Annex B Party commitments<lb/> under the Kyoto Protocol is not only based on national GHG inventories. Rather, a set of anthropogenic<lb/> LULUCF activities was identified with an impact on GHG emissions or removals. This approach is known<lb/> as the &quot; activity-based &quot; approach. An activity-based approach to LULUCF accounting was chosen partly in<lb/> order to limit the risk of non-anthropogenic emissions and removals being counted towards the mitigation<lb/> commitments of Annex B Parties and to deal with the difficulties associated with legacy effects in the<lb/> forestry sector. Accounting is mandatory for some LULUCF activities and voluntary for others (as shown<lb/> in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The accounting framework of the Kyoto Protocol has a robust reporting and review system. Colour-coded<lb/> common reporting format (CRF) tables are used for reporting which enhances clarity. Technical expert<lb/> reviews of GHG inventories, national communications and biennial reports of Annex I countries (as well<lb/> as a compliance process) provide confidence in the information reported.<lb/></p>

			<p>The accounting system of the Kyoto Protocol has evolved between the first and second commitment<lb/> period. A major change was the introduction of Forest Management Reference Levels (FMRLs) to account<lb/> for forestry management in a way that could deal with legacy effects. In addition, forest management<lb/> became a mandatory activity and the scope of accounting was expanded to include wetland drainage and<lb/> rewetting. Further changes were made through other technical rules, such as provisions for treating natural<lb/> disturbances and harvested wood products (for further details see Canaveira, 2013, and <ref type="biblio">Iversen et al.,<lb/> 2014</ref>).<lb/> Forest management reference levels were introduced for forest management activities in the second<lb/> commitment period in order to help Parties avoid the random effects that age-class distribution can have on<lb/> emissions and removals from forest management. FMRLS are baselines against which progress in<lb/> implementation of forest management activities is measured. Parties were given some flexibility in the<lb/> methodological approaches used to construct FMRLS. These FMRL were also reviewed by technical<lb/> experts in order to enhance their credibility. The significant impact of the technical review process was<lb/> reflected by the fact that at least 23 Parties out of 38 revised their FMRLS following the review (UNFCCC,<lb/> 2011a). Despite some inconsistencies, the technical review concluded that the information provided by<lb/> Parties about the construction of the FRMLS was &quot; sufficiently transparent and thus fulfils most of the<lb/> required criteria &quot; (ibid.).<lb/> One of the challenges associated with LULUCF accounting under the Kyoto Protocol for the first<lb/> commitment period was that the LULUCF accounting provisions were negotiated after national<lb/> commitments to limit or reduce emissions had already been agreed. This provided an incentive for Parties<lb/> to negotiate accounting rules that would make it easier to meet their already-fixed emissions commitments.<lb/> Ideally, the POST-2020 accounting framework would be agreed before future commitments are finalised,<lb/> so that commitments are influenced by the accounting framework. Given the short time remaining,<lb/> however, it is unlikely that all of the details of the accounting framework will be agreed before intended<lb/> nationally determined contributions are put forward under the ADP. Therefore Section 4 of this paper<lb/> explores what could be agreed by 2015, and what could be worked on in 2016-2020.<lb/></p>

			<head>REDD for developing countries<lb/></head>

			<p>REDD+ provides recognition for enhanced action to combat deforestation and forest degradation as well as<lb/> conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon<lb/> stocks in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2010). Reducing or preventing deforestation has been identified<lb/> by the IPCC as the mitigation option with the most immediate and greatest effect on carbon stocks in the<lb/> short term, and is highly cost-effective (IPCC, 2014a). However, strong measurement, reporting and<lb/> verification (MRV) provisions are needed to ensure that emission reductions from REDD+ are real. As part<lb/> of the &quot; Warsaw Framework for REDD-plus &quot; , specific modalities for MRV were agreed upon (UNFCCC,<lb/> 2013e).<lb/> Reference levels for forestry are used to measure progress on REDD+. In 2011, the COP invited REDD+<lb/> countries to communicate their forest reference emissions levels and/or forest reference levels to the<lb/> UNFCCC Secretariat. The COP subsequently agreed in 2013 that each submission is to undergo a<lb/> technical assessment, to assess the degree to which the information provided is in accordance with the<lb/> reporting guidelines and to offer a &quot; facilitative, non-intrusive, technical exchange of information &quot; on the<lb/> reference levels (UNFCCC, 2013a). The first forest reference level was submitted by Brazil in June 2014<lb/> (Government of <ref type="biblio">Brazil, 2014</ref>).<lb/> REDD+ reporting provisions include social and environmental safeguards. A list of safeguards was<lb/> established at COP 16 and REDD+ Parties are to submit reports on how these safeguards are being<lb/> addressed and respected (UNFCCC, 2011b). Examples of safeguards include conservation of natural<lb/> forests and biological diversity as well as respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and<lb/> members of local communities. While the extent to which the current provisions for safeguards will have<lb/> an impact on the ground is yet to be seen, this could be an important step towards protecting the rights of<lb/> local communities and moving towards more open and inclusive forms of decision-making on important<lb/> land-related issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reduced Emissions from All Land Uses (REALU) in developing countries<lb/></head>

			<p>Expanding the scope of land sector reporting and accounting in developing countries over time could help<lb/> Parties to receive recognition for a greater range of the mitigation opportunities that exist in the sector, and<lb/> lead to more joined up policy-making. In particular, the agriculture sector needs to be covered by the<lb/> accounting framework in a way that does not compromise, or if possible enhances, food production. To<lb/> this end, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has developed a methodology for &quot; Reduced Emissions<lb/> from All Land Uses &quot; (REALU) in developing countries, and is currently exploring the feasibility of this<lb/> landscape approach in Cameroon, Indonesia, Peru and Vietnam. The REALU approach addresses the<lb/> partial accounting of REDD+ and the emission reduction potential in other land uses such as trees outside<lb/> forests. It is based on baselines and Reference Emission Levels (RELs) and aims at credit generation.<lb/> While development of the REALU methodology is taking place outside of the UNFCCC process,<lb/> proponents describe REALU as a possible stepping stone between REDD+ and broad land sector<lb/> accounting in the post-2020 period (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">Bernard et al., 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Project-level methodologies<lb/></head>

			<p>There are currently two types of forestry sector projects (afforestation and reforestation activities) that can<lb/> be eligible to receive credits under the CDM. The credits generated by these projects can be purchased by<lb/> Annex B Parties and used to meet part of their commitments. The issue of non-permanence is dealt with by<lb/> the issuance of temporary</p>

			<table>Certified Emission Reduction units (tCERs or lCERs) to afforestation and<lb/> reforestation projects under the CDM. To date the number of such projects has been low (55 as of July<lb/> 2014, representing around 2 Mt CO 2 -eq) and concentrated in a small number of countries (mainly<lb/> Colombia, India, Brazil, Moldova and China) (UNFCCC, 2014a).<lb/> CDM methodologies also exist for some agriculture-related projects addressing non-CO 2 gases. These<lb/> include manure management, methane avoidance/recovery, offsetting of nitrogen fertiliser use, use of<lb/> agriculture residues for energy production and reduced emissions from rice cultivation. There is also<lb/> experience in the voluntary carbon markets sector regarding project-level methodologies in the land sector.<lb/> The bottom-up nature of voluntary markets means that different mechanisms have different methodologies<lb/> and geographic scopes.<lb/></table>

			<head>NAMAs under the Cancun Agreements<lb/></head>

			<p>Many developing countries have put forward nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) in the<lb/> land sector for 2020 (and/or other years). The future land sector reporting and accounting system could<lb/> learn lessons from REDD+ and the process for NAMAs (<ref type="biblio">Canaveira, 2013</ref>). While progress in<lb/> implementation of REDD+ activities is to be conducted via country-specific reference levels, many<lb/> countries have also chosen to express NAMAs as goals relative to &quot; business as usual &quot; baselines in 2020. It<lb/> is possible that these two approaches could be merged, with NAMAs providing &quot; broad economy-wide low-<lb/>emission development strategies &quot; and REDD+ activities forming part of this strategy (GIZ, 2013).<lb/> While REDD+ applies only to forestry-related activities, NAMAs can encompass almost any mitigation<lb/> activity and form, from economy-wide or sectoral emissions reduction goals and policies and measures to<lb/> individual projects and programmes. REDD+ activities themselves could be considered NAMAs. Land<lb/> sector NAMAs targeting the whole AFOLU sector could be significantly wider in scope than REDD+<lb/> activities. Similar to the safeguards under REDD+, Parties could be invited to provide information about<lb/> other benefits of mitigation activities under the NAMA approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aligning the approaches for the establishment of baselines for NAMAs and REDD+ could facilitate result-<lb/>based payments (GIZ, 2013). REDD+ and NAMAs both require a transparent MRV framework that could<lb/> be streamlined via the establishment of a national MRV framework including both approaches. COP 19<lb/> further decided that the MRV for REDD+ should be coherent with guidance for the MRV for NAMAs<lb/> (UNFCCC, 2014b).<lb/></p>

			<head>Agriculture<lb/></head>

			<table>For Annex B Parties, anthropogenic GHG emissions from agriculture are covered by the reporting and<lb/> accounting framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Annex B Parties are to ensure that their emissions of the<lb/> gases listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol do not exceed their assigned amounts. This annex includes,<lb/> 20<lb/> among other gases, CH 4 , N 2 O and CO 2 from enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation,<lb/> agricultural soils, prescribed burning of savannahs, and field burning of agricultural residues. Agriculture<lb/> is treated in the same way as other inventory categories under the KP. Further, there are a small number of<lb/> CDM methodologies available to quantify emission reductions from manure management, methane<lb/> recovery, offsetting nitrogen fertiliser use and rice cultivation projects in developing countries.<lb/></table>

			<p>Most developed countries have clarified that agriculture will be included in their emissions reduction<lb/> targets for 2020 under the Cancun Agreements (UNFCCC, 2013b). Many non-Annex I Parties or groups of<lb/> Parties have communicated mitigation actions relating to agriculture under the Cancun Agreements (e.g.<lb/> the African Group, Chad, Colombia, Côte d&apos;Ivoire, Dominica, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Indonesia,<lb/> Jordan, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Swaziland, Tunisia) (UNFCCC, 2013c). However, in most cases<lb/> the precise scope of the actions and how they will be accounted for remains unclear.<lb/></p>

			<p>An approach is needed for the post-2020 period that promotes mitigation action while taking into account<lb/> competing policy priorities such as food production. One possible solution would be for Parties to choose<lb/> to put forward mitigation actions in the agriculture sector using reference levels or intensity or productivity<lb/> metrics, such as GHG emissions per unit of agricultural output. Such approaches would take into account<lb/> the fact that absolute increases in GHG emissions from the agriculture sector are expected for some<lb/> countries in the short term, but Parties could still receive recognition under the 2015 agreement for taking<lb/> action to increase efficiency in this sector and decouple GHG emissions from output.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Special characteristics of the LULUCF part of the land sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The LULUCF part of the land sector has a number of special features that distinguish it from emissions<lb/> from agriculture, energy, transport, industry and waste (<ref type="biblio">Estrada et al., 2014</ref>). These features include<lb/> difficulty in separating anthropogenic from natural emissions and removals, strong legacy effects due to<lb/> structural features of forests, and potential reversals of GHG removals due to natural disturbances or<lb/> human activities. There tend to be high uncertainties in estimates of emissions and removals from<lb/> agriculture and LULUCF. Further, often there are also competing goods and services for the same land,<lb/> such as agricultural production and biodiversity conservation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Identifying anthropogenic emissions and removals<lb/></head>

			<p>The UNFCCC is focused on anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals. However, for LULUCF it can<lb/> be especially difficult to separate anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions and removals. This is<lb/> because the flows of emissions and removals through ecological systems are complex and it is difficult to<lb/> identify causality. For example, a wild fire can be indirectly affected by human activities such as former<lb/> harvesting activities or fire suppression, while a fire started by humans can be substantially influenced by<lb/> natural causes such as prior drought (IPCC, 2009).<lb/> The IPCC approach used to separate anthropogenic emissions and removals in GHG inventories is known<lb/> as the &quot; managed land proxy &quot; . The managed land proxy works by dividing the total land area into managed<lb/> and unmanaged land. Emissions and removals occurring on managed land are assumed to be<lb/> anthropogenic, while emissions and removals occurring on unmanaged land are assumed to be naturally<lb/> occurring. The IPCC definition of managed land is &quot; land where human interventions and practices have<lb/> been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions &quot; (IPCC, 2009).<lb/> This proxy is used since for LULUCF activities there is currently no practicable methodology available to<lb/> factor out direct anthropogenic effects from indirect anthropogenic and natural effects. Estimates of GHG<lb/> emissions and removals on managed lands are therefore used as a proxy for anthropogenic emissions and<lb/> removals.<lb/></p>

			<head>Legacy effects<lb/></head>

			<p>Patterns of harvesting and replanting can have significant impacts on forest-related anthropogenic GHG<lb/> emissions and removals over a given period. These impacts are known as legacy effects, since the impacts<lb/> can stem from past management decisions which affect the age-class structure of forests. Harvest activities<lb/> influence the carbon stock of forest ecosystems especially via the subsequent regrowth and higher<lb/> sequestration rates. Those effects can last for decades and can be greater than forest management activities<lb/> during a given period (Böttcher, <ref type="biblio">Kurz and Freibauer, 2008</ref>). As a consequence, Parties implementing the<lb/> same management activities can have very different results depending on the age structure of their forest<lb/> ecosystems. Countries with a high percentage of forests can substantially benefit (or lose out) from past<lb/> harvesting activities. Legacy effects are most significant for forests, due to the long production cycles<lb/> involved, but can also be observed to a lesser extent in other systems such as croplands.<lb/></p>

			<p>The treatment of legacy effects was part of the development of the accounting rules from the first to the<lb/> second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. For the second commitment period, forest<lb/> management is mandatory and Parties are able to incorporate legacy effects in the construction of projected<lb/> FMRLs. A significant advantage of projected reference levels is the avoidance of a so-called &quot; base year<lb/> lottery &quot; that creates advantages or disadvantages due to the emission level in the base year (<ref type="biblio">Canaveira,<lb/> 2013</ref>).<lb/> Previous CCXG work has highlighted that many different methods exist for developing baselines and<lb/> information on underlying assumptions is the key to understanding baselines (<ref type="biblio">Clapp and Prag, 2012</ref>)</p>

			<table>.<lb/> While various approaches to developing FMRLs can provide flexibility for Parties and therefore<lb/> incorporate a range of national circumstances, this variety also reduce the comparability of approaches<lb/> used (EDF, 2012). The approaches used by Parties for setting FMRLs in the second KP commitment<lb/> period were (UNFCCC, 2011a):<lb/> a) Projections using country-specific methodologies (17 Parties)<lb/> b) Projections using a common approach developed by the European Commission Joint Research<lb/> Centre (14 Parties)<lb/> c) Historical FMRL based on a single year (3 Parties)<lb/> d) Average emissions and removals during a historical time series (1 Party)<lb/> e) Linear extrapolation of a historical trend (2 Parties)<lb/></table>

			<p>f) Setting the baseline to zero, known as &quot; gross–net accounting &quot; (1 Party)<lb/></p>

			<head>Natural disturbances and reversals of CO 2 removals<lb/></head>

			<p>The removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere by land sinks via photosynthesis is not necessarily a permanent<lb/> process. There are several means by which this process can be reversed and the stored carbon can be<lb/> released back into the atmosphere. These include the occurrence of natural disturbances, such as natural<lb/> fires or the outbreak of pests or a disease, or human activities, such as subsequent harvesting or land-use<lb/> change. Carbon stocks in the land sector are therefore said to have a high risk of &quot; non-permanence &quot; .<lb/> Examples of natural disturbances that have resulted in substantive GHG emissions from the land sector<lb/> include forest fires in <ref type="biblio">Australia</ref> and bark beetle infestations in Canada. 7<lb/> 7<lb/> The infestation of forests with bark beetles can lead to a high mortality of large areas of forests that causes significant<lb/> emissions. A pine beetle infestation in 2008 in Canada produced the same amount of carbon emissions as a five year<lb/> period of Canada&apos;s transport sector (Bateman, 2012).<lb/></figure>

			<head>22<lb/></head>

			<p>The frequency (and in some cases the severity) of natural disturbances for forests and soils is likely to<lb/> increase due to climate change (<ref type="biblio">Seidl et al., 2014</ref>). For example, an outbreak of mountain pine beetle has<lb/> devastated 11 million hectares of forest in Canada and the US since the late 1990s. This significant<lb/> disturbance has been exacerbated by higher average winter temperatures, which are highly likely to be a<lb/> consequence of anthropogenic climate change (FAO, 2010).<lb/> The possibility of sequestration reversals by natural disturbances beyond the control of the Party concerned<lb/> can represent a significant risk to the achievement of mitigation targets or actions. Therefore special<lb/> provisions may be agreed to manage this risk. In the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol there<lb/> was no natural disturbances provision, other than the use of the managed land proxy. The issue of non-<lb/>permanence was dealt with in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol with the inclusion of a<lb/> so-called &quot; natural disturbance provision &quot; . The natural disturbance provision allows Parties to exclude<lb/> emissions from accounting resulting from events that are not &quot; materially influenced &quot; by the Party and<lb/> thereby guarantees that Parties are not penalised for nature-induced emissions (UNFCCC, 2011c). The<lb/> removals following the disturbance are also excluded.<lb/></p>

			<p>To be eligible to use the natural disturbances provision, a Party must include information in its 2015<lb/> national inventory report on the background level of emissions from natural disturbances included in its<lb/> FMRL. In order to be excluded from accounting, emissions from a natural disturbance must exceed a<lb/> background level (plus a margin, if applicable), and no land-use change can take place after the natural<lb/> disturbance. Reporting requirements help to ensure that this provision is not &quot; gamed &quot; . The natural<lb/> disturbances provision only applies to afforestation, reforestation and forest management activities. A<lb/> disadvantage of the natural disturbances provision is that emissions from substantial land areas may not be<lb/> accounted for (<ref type="biblio">Funk, 2014</ref>).<lb/> It is possible that the natural disturbances provision could be expanded to other activities and lands such as<lb/> cropland and grassland, as well as draught (<ref type="biblio">Canaveira, 2013</ref>). There could also be a single natural<lb/> disturbance provision for all IPCC forest categories, rather than separate provisions for separate lands and<lb/> activities (<ref type="biblio">Estrada et. al, 2014</ref>). An expansion of that provision would require further guidance on<lb/> emissions resulting from natural disturbances, since the only guidance to date on forest-related emissions<lb/> under the Kyoto Protocol is in the IPCC 2013 KP Supplement. This guidance only applies to Annex B<lb/> Parties and there is currently no guidance for non-KP Parties or developing countries (<ref type="biblio">Iversen et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> An exclusion of the natural disturbances provision within the new climate agreement might lead reduced<lb/> ambition by Parties with high risk of natural disturbance (<ref type="biblio">Estrada et al. 2014</ref>). According to <ref type="biblio">Funk (2014)</ref>,<lb/> the voluntary option for excluding natural disturbances could be maintained under the condition of<lb/> adopting &quot; robust criteria and strong review &quot; .<lb/> Non-permanence is also an issue if credits for stored carbon have been issued via a project-based<lb/> mechanism such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and used to offset emissions elsewhere. In<lb/> order to deal with the potential reversibility of land-carbon stocks, afforestation and reforestation projects<lb/> under the CDM are issued special credits known as temporary certified emissions reductions (tCERs) or<lb/> long-term CERs (lCERs). Temporary CERs expire at the end of the commitment period in which they are<lb/> issued, and have to be replaced. Long-term CERs expire at the end of a crediting period (which can be up<lb/> to 30 years, or 20+20+20 years), with verification every five years that reversals have not occurred.<lb/></p>

			<p>The additional risk of having credits that may need to be replaced in future leads to a lower market price<lb/> for credits from afforestation and reforestation projects compared to conventional CDM projects. There are<lb/> ongoing discussions in the UNFCCC regarding alternative approaches to deal with the risk of non-<lb/>permanence in the context of the CDM. The issue of non-permanence has yet to be addressed in the<lb/> context of REDD+. While LULUCF accounting encompasses both credits and debits, under REDD+ only<lb/> reductions in emissions have so far been recognised, although further rules could emerge in future.<lb/></p>

			<head>High uncertainty and inter-annual variability<lb/></head>

			<p>There is some uncertainty associated with estimates of anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals in any<lb/> sector. Due to the complex nature of the land sector, however, which comprises a diffuse set of linked<lb/> ecosystems on land and in the soil, emissions and removals from this sector are particularly difficult to<lb/> estimate accurately. This is not simply a reflection of different levels of national capacity for measuring<lb/> and reporting – there can be significant uncertainty associated with data (both in terms of activity data and<lb/> emission factors) for developed countries with high capacity, as well as for developing countries with low<lb/> capacity. Further, annual fluctuations in anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals from LULUCF can<lb/> be significantly greater than those for other sectors. In some cases, for example, LULUCF can go from<lb/> being a net sink one year to a net source the next.<lb/> Annex I countries perform an uncertainty calculation as part of their annual national inventory reports.<lb/> Information is provided on the activity data uncertainty, the emission or removal factor uncertainty, and the<lb/> combined uncertainty for each emissions source or sink in the inventory as well as the overall uncertainty<lb/> in the national total and in the national trend. In the case of</p>

			<table>New Zealand&apos;s 2014 GHG inventory,<lb/> containing data for the year 2012, the combined uncertainty associated with CO 2 emissions from liquid<lb/> fuels was 3%. By contrast, the combined uncertainty was 16% for CH 4 emissions from enteric<lb/> fermentation, 30% for CH 4 emissions from manure management, 54% for CO 2 emissions from forest land,<lb/> 74% for N 2 O emissions from agricultural soils, and up to 100% for N 2 O emissions from manure<lb/> management (New Zealand Government, 2014a).<lb/></table>

			<p>The extent to which this uncertainty translates to uncertainty in total anthropogenic GHG emissions<lb/> depends on the relative weights of each source or sink in a country&apos;s total emissions, and uncertainty is<lb/> reduced because uncorrelated uncertainties do not add linearly. Furthermore the uncertainty on a trend is<lb/> generally smaller than the absolute uncertainty in any year. Nevertheless, there is generally greater<lb/> uncertainty associated with the GHG inventories of Parties for which AFOLU accounts for a high share of<lb/> total anthropogenic GHG emissions, and lower uncertainty for Parties for which AFOLU accounts for only<lb/> a low share of total emissions.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the levels of uncertainty for estimates of emissions and removals from the land sector are relatively<lb/> high, advances in remote sensing technology for tracking land-use change are helping to reduce them. In<lb/> particular, the use of satellites is revolutionising this area. Some data are already freely-available from<lb/> space agencies and the next generation of earth observation satellites will provide open access to advanced,<lb/> high-resolution land-use mapping tools (Box 1).<lb/></p>

			<table>Box 1: Recent developments in satellite remote sensing technology and tracking initiatives for land sector<lb/> observations<lb/> As part of the Copernicus space programme being undertaken by the European Commission and the European Space Agency<lb/> (ESA), the ESA is launching a new family of missions called Sentinels (ESA, 2014). Each mission consists of two satellites<lb/> carrying a range of different technologies and imaging instruments for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Sentinel-1<lb/> was launched in April 2014 and will provide free and open access data for</table>

			<p>the monitoring of forest, water, soil and<lb/> agriculture lands. The twin satellites, orbiting 180° apart, will image the entire Earth once every six days, with a spatial<lb/> resolution of up to 5x5 m.

The MGD systematically sets out for the first time how the impact of REDD+ activities can be estimated<lb/> using IPCC methodologies. The MGD was developed by UN-REDD, the World Bank Forest Carbon Partnership Facility<lb/> (FCPF), the space agencies and other land sector experts. The space agencies have agreed to make freely available (via a<lb/> specially established Space Data Coordination Group) remotely sensed data from a set of core missions identified in the<lb/> MGD, including Landsat (which has the most extensive archive of historical data relevant to REDD+) and Sentinel.<lb/> Global Forest Watch (GFW), convened by the World Resource Institute, is an online monitoring tool and alert system<lb/> providing timely data about global forest loss (WRI, 2014a). The tool was established in February 2014. Using satellite<lb/> technology and cloud-computing power, GFW provides maps showing current forest management as well as protected areas<lb/> with a 500 m resolution, including global forest change maps produced by the University of Maryland using Landsat data. A<lb/> unique asset of GFW is its crowdsourcing function that allows users to upload and share data and build networks and<lb/> coalitions within the GFW. In July 2014, a new program called Global Forest Watch Fires was launched in collaboration<lb/> with the National REDD+ Agency of Indonesia (WRI, 2014b).

The result is a 3D map showing carbon density at up to a 1x1 m resolution. The total carbon stock was<lb/> estimated to be around 6.9 billion tonnes, with the largest stocks located in the northern Peruvian Amazon and along the<lb/> Brazil-Peru border.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and<lb/> accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>This section lays out possible elements of a long-term vision for land sector reporting and accounting. The<lb/> aim of this exercise is to outline possible elements for a long-term vision to work back from, as a means to<lb/> generate discussion on the issue. Other ways forward are no doubt possible. The precise time frame of the<lb/> vision is not specified. The full vision might not be attained by 2020. Parties could agree to a shared<lb/> direction of travel along various dimensions of the accounting framework, such as agreement to increase<lb/> the comprehensiveness of accounting over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Possible elements of a long-term vision<lb/></head>

			<p>The long-term aim of post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting could be to create a multi-<lb/>dimensional reporting and accounting framework that is applicable to all Parties and increases the<lb/> comprehensiveness of reporting and accounting over time. The possible elements of a long-term vision for<lb/> land sector reporting and accounting identified in this paper include generic elements (i.e. elements that are<lb/> relevant to all sectors) and land-specific elements (i.e. elements that are relevant to the land sector only).<lb/> The elements include:<lb/></p>

			<head>Generic elements (relevant to all sectors)<lb/></head>

			<p>• Use of IPCC 2006 Guidelines by all Parties (with flexibility for least developed countries and<lb/> small island developing states) for reporting key sources and sinks, with different Parties using<lb/> different tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity.<lb/> • Increasing quality and accuracy of reporting for land sector sources and sinks (i.e. using higher<lb/> IPCC tiers for key categories where possible).<lb/> • Provision of up-front information alongside intended nationally determined contributions that<lb/> promotes transparency, clarity and understanding.<lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of<lb/> different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances<lb/> and capacities of countries.<lb/> • Focus on cost-effective reporting and accounting.<lb/> • Recognition of need of means of implementation to increase reporting and accounting capacity in<lb/> developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<head>Land-specific elements (relevant to the land sector only)<lb/></head>

			<p>• Increasing coverage over successive cycles of nationally determined contributions for accounting<lb/> of anthropogenic sources and sinks (with existing comprehensive accounting of non-CO 2<lb/> emissions from agriculture to continue for Annex B Parties).<lb/> • Provisions to address age-class structure effects in forests and the risk of natural disturbances and<lb/> reversals of sequestered carbon from forests and other land sinks.<lb/> • Use of a &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule for coverage of sources and sinks.<lb/> • Accommodate mitigation contributions expressed relative to reference levels or using intensity<lb/> metrics relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective<lb/> accounting options that take into account national circumstances.<lb/> • Technical assessment of reference levels where appropriate to increase confidence in the baselines<lb/> against which progress is tracked.<lb/> • Reporting of qualitative information on a Parties&apos; vision for the land sector and the multiple<lb/> benefits of policies and environmental and social safeguards (where applicable), to complement<lb/> the quantitative accounting framework.<lb/> Reporting can provide the technical information necessary to undertake accounting. Information on<lb/> anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals could be reported on a regular basis (e.g. annually) by all<lb/> Parties, perhaps with additional flexibility for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island<lb/> Developing States (SIDSs). Reports would be prepared in accordance with IPCC methodologies agreed by<lb/> the COP (as for other sectors). Use of 2006 IPCC guidelines for inventory reporting by all Parties would<lb/> help to ensure that the information on which accounting is based is transparent, accurate, consistent,<lb/> comparable and complete. The IPCC guidelines for GHG inventories are periodically updated and<lb/> expanded to reflect the latest developments in scientific understanding and data availability.<lb/></p>

			<p>An effective future land sector reporting and accounting framework would have broad coverage of key<lb/> sources and sinks of anthropogenic GHGs from agriculture, forestry and other land uses. This would help<lb/> to avoid selective inclusion of anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals for certain types of land or<lb/> activities, or &quot; cherry-picking &quot; , by governments. It would ensure that the reporting and accounting<lb/> framework best represents all anthropogenic emissions and removals without creating perverse outcomes,<lb/> and incentivises governments to take a holistic approach to land sector mitigation (<ref type="biblio">Canaveira, 2013</ref>). This<lb/> in turn could help to minimise indirect emissions caused by the shifting of emissions-intensive activities<lb/> from one area inside the accounting framework to another outside it (e.g. in the case of bioenergy).<lb/> Regarding the total area of land covered, countries could be encouraged to report the quantity of<lb/> unmanaged land in their jurisdictions as a matter of best practice, to enable a complete picture of land-use<lb/> changes to be built up over time (<ref type="biblio">Canaveira, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Some aspects of the land sector reporting and accounting framework would continue to be flexible in order<lb/> to take into account the different national circumstances and reporting and accounting capacities of<lb/> countries. There are different ways in which flexibility could be included, such as:<lb/> • How the land sector is treated within nationally determined contributions (with a view to moving<lb/> towards broad coverage of key sources over time).<lb/> • The definitions used of terms such as &quot; forest &quot; (although these might be within a range of values,<lb/> e.g. for percentage tree cover).<lb/> • The designation of areas of managed and unmanaged land.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The approach used to determine the baseline or reference level against which progress in<lb/> implementation will be measured.<lb/> • The possibility to expand the use of reference levels to other land management activities (i.e.<lb/> beyond forest management) within the overall framework being adopted for nationally determined<lb/> contributions.<lb/></p>

			<p>While some flexibility will be necessary in order to create a reporting and accounting framework that is<lb/> applicable to all Parties, there is also a risk that too much flexibility could result in Parties claiming<lb/> emissions reductions that are not real or additional. The agreement of a shared direction of travel for land<lb/> sector accounting, combined with the &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule, could help to ensure the environmental<lb/> integrity of mitigation efforts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the widely varying national circumstances of different Parties, it may be difficult to agree a single<lb/> approach for setting baselines or reference levels for all nationally determined contributions in the land<lb/> sector. While different Parties could use different approaches for establishing reference levels (e.g.<lb/> historical base years, simple extrapolations of recent trends, advanced projections), a high level of<lb/> transparency would help to increase clarity and understanding of the baselines or reference levels used.<lb/> Decision 12/CP.17 calls for developing countries to provide &quot; transparent &quot; and &quot; complete &quot; information on<lb/> their forest reference levels and/or forest reference emissions levels, including historical data used to<lb/> construct the reference level, data sets or assumptions used, a description of changes since the previous<lb/> submission, the definition of forest used, and reasons why significant pools or activities were omitted if<lb/> applicable (UNFCCC, 2011d). Similar data could be provided in the post-2020 period.<lb/></p>

			<p>Projected reference levels can be used to factor out non-anthropogenic impacts such as CO 2 fertilisation<lb/> and nitrogen deposition but also imply high uncertainties regarding projected harvesting levels. While the<lb/> use of reference levels so far only applies to forest management, an expansion of this approach to other<lb/> land sector categories is possible if consistent with the overall approach being adopted for national<lb/> contributions.<lb/></p>

			<table>The processes established for technical assessment of FMRLs under the Kyoto Protocol and forest<lb/> reference levels and forest reference emissions levels for developing countries under REDD+ have helped<lb/> 27<lb/> to build confidence in the accuracy of the information provided. Similar technical review cycles could be<lb/> continued in the post-2020 period.<lb/></table>

			<p>Mitigation in the land sector cannot be a substitute for action to reduce emissions from fossil fuel<lb/> combustion. Deep and cost-effective cuts in GHG emissions from all sectors are needed if the below 2 °C<lb/> long-term global goal is to be kept within reach. In the case of economy-wide nationally determined<lb/> contributions, the inclusion of the land sector within a well-designed and cost-effective reporting and<lb/> accounting framework should enable Parties to achieve more ambitious mitigation goals and not provide<lb/> accounting loopholes or otherwise weaken the level of ambition of nationally determined contributions.<lb/> Accounting in the context of the Kyoto Protocol is mainly focused on quantitative data on anthropogenic<lb/> GHG emissions and removals, as well as GHG units from market mechanisms or other metrics for<lb/> measuring progress in implementation of mitigation targets and actions (Hood, Briner and Rocha, 2014).<lb/> However, one of the guiding principles for LULUCF accounting under the Kyoto Protocol is that &quot; the<lb/> implementation of <ref type="biblio">[LULUCF]</ref> activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use<lb/> of resources &quot; (UNFCCC, 2005). While the accounting framework itself may focus on mitigation only, a<lb/> well-designed framework can incentivise actions with other benefits, such as climate-friendly urban land<lb/> planning, ecosystem-based adaptation and climate-smart agriculture (</p>

			<table>Box 2). In addition to climate change<lb/> benefits, such actions could contribute towards achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs)<lb/> currently being developed following the Rio+20 conference in 2012. As of August 2014, the draft list of<lb/> possible SDGs includes goals to promote sustainable agriculture, make cities resilient and sustainable,<lb/> sustainably manage forests, and halt land degradation and biodiversity loss (UN, 2014).<lb/></table>

			<p>Reporting qualitative information on multiple benefits alongside the quantitative accounting framework<lb/> could encourage countries to adopt policies with multiple benefits and provide recognition for such<lb/> policies. Several Parties, including Brazil, China, the Philippines, the EU, the US and Japan, have<lb/> highlighted the importance of incentivising non-carbon benefits in recent UNFCCC submissions on<lb/> REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2014c). In some cases, these benefits may contribute to the permanence of forests by<lb/> decreasing the risk of reversals (WWF, 2014).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Box 2: Reporting of qualitative information relating to the land sector<lb/></figure>

			<p>As a complement to the quantitative accounting framework, qualitative information could be reported in the following areas:<lb/></p>

			<table>• Urban land planning<lb/> • Ecosystem-based adaptation<lb/> • Climate-smart agriculture<lb/> • Climate-resilient landscapes<lb/> • Social and environmental safeguards (where appropriate)<lb/></table>

			<p>A key driver of land-use change is the rapid expansion of cities in many regions, also known as urban sprawl, which is<lb/> influenced by urban land planning. Since the 1950s, the urban land area in non-OECD countries has increased fivefold<lb/> (OECD, 2009) and the demand for land for built-up areas is expected to increase faster than the actual population size in 30<lb/> of 34 OECD countries (OECD, 2012). Urban areas are vulnerable to impacts from climate change due to their location (often<lb/> on the coast), infrastructure, and warming is amplified within cities due to the urban heat island effect (OECD, 2009). Urban<lb/> land planning should incorporate climate change considerations and aim at decreasing future land consumption. The<lb/> introduction of policies fostering urban densification, e.g. via a BAU baseline or emission intensity per capita, can lead to<lb/> significant reductions in anthropogenic GHG emissions. This concept of &quot; compact cities &quot; also has wider social and<lb/> economic benefits and can thereby contribute to sustainability within an urban context.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ecosystem-based adaptation acknowledges</head>

			<p>the role of biodiversity and ecosystem services in building and enhancing<lb/> resilience and reducing vulnerability. Examples include wetland restoration and biodiversity conservation (Adaptation<lb/> Committee, 2013). Climate-smart agriculture aims at enlarging agricultural productivity in a sustainable matter, while<lb/> reducing greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. Examples of climate-smart agriculture include reduced or no<lb/> tillage with direct seeding and permanent soil cover, or better drought management for example by use of manure (FAO,<lb/> 2013).<lb/></p>

			<head>Climate-resilient landscapes</head>

			<p>are part of a broader landscape approach which puts emphasis on maintaining or achieving a<lb/> healthy ecosystem for the provision of ecosystem services. Climate-resilient landscapes are able to absorb shocks and<lb/> changes of climate without losing its functionality (<ref type="biblio">Sekhran, 2010</ref>). A recent conference on &quot; Landscapes for People, Food<lb/> and Nature in Africa &quot; highlighted the need for integrated landscapes that address the inter-linked challenges of food security,<lb/> ecosystem services, biodiversity, climate change and water (<ref type="biblio">Esipisu, 2014</ref>). Such solutions include scaling up landscape-<lb/>level interventions such as terracing, agroforestry, reforestation, cultivation of local varieties, landslide prevention, riverbank<lb/> stabilisation and watershed management (<ref type="biblio">Munang, 2014</ref>). The 2015 agreement could encourage Parties to pursue national<lb/> strategies that promote non-carbon benefits and to share information on these benefits with other Parties in the UNFCCC.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social and environmental safeguards</head>

			<p>aim to protect the rights of indigenous peoples and other stakeholders whose<lb/> livelihoods depend on the land sector. These safeguards would mainly apply to forestry-related supported actions and could<lb/> build upon the set of safeguards established for REDD+ at COP 16 (UNFCCC, 2010). These include provisions such as<lb/> ensuring that actions are consistent with national programmes, that governments respect the knowledge and rights of<lb/> indigenous peoples, that stakeholder participation is full and effective, and that actions conserve natural ecosystems and<lb/> protect biodiversity<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 A shared direction of travel for land sector reporting and accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>A foundation for the post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting framework could be for all Parties to<lb/> agree a shared direction of travel in terms of increasing the quality of reporting while widening the<lb/> coverage of accounting over time (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). While these are two important dimensions of the reporting<lb/> and accounting framework, <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> outlines some of the other possible dimensions. The new reporting and<lb/> accounting framework should build on what is already in place under the Convention and the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol, taking into account the strengths of each system. The land sector reporting and accounting<lb/> framework will be an important component of the broader accounting framework, which would address<lb/> other issues such as the MRV of information on actions and support and the use of market and non-market<lb/> mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. A shared direction of travel for land sector accounting<lb/></figure>

			<p>Countries might progress along each the dimensions outlined in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> independently. There would be no<lb/> fixed order in which dimensions are to be addressed: some Parties might choose to expand their coverage<lb/> first, others might focus on using higher IPCC tiers first, etc. While there would be flexibility in terms of<lb/> how Parties address these dimensions, and different Parties may choose different pathways, the shared<lb/> direction of travel would be common to all Parties. The process would be iterative, with Parties starting at<lb/> different points and improving from there.<lb/> Parties with lower capacity would use lower IPCC reporting tiers, relying heavily on default emissions<lb/> factors. Data availability is likely to be limited in terms of geographical coverage and time, perhaps<lb/> covering one or two regions with long gaps between years for which data is available. The coverage of<lb/> reporting and accounting would depend on national capacity and experience. The provision of finance,<lb/> technology and capacity building activities, such as training courses for staff to learn how to use land<lb/> sector monitoring technologies and data processing software, would be crucial for low capacity countries<lb/> to increase the comprehensiveness of their land sector accounting.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 COP 20, Lima<lb/></head>

			<p>Parties could agree at COP 20 what up-front information specific to the land sector is to be provided<lb/> alongside intended nationally determined contributions (which are to be communicated by the first quarter<lb/> of 2015 by Parties ready to do so). Given the diverse nature of nationally determined contributions, up-<lb/>front information will play an important role in increasing understanding, clarity and transparency of the<lb/> actions proposed.<lb/></p>

			<p>The up-front information needed to understand mitigation targets and goals is outlined in Briner and Prag<lb/> (2013) and Levin et al. (2014). In the case of nationally determined contributions expressed relative to<lb/> baselines or reference levels (which could be economy-wide contributions, contributions in the land sector<lb/> only, or for sub-sectors within an economy-wide contribution), up-front information on the assumptions<lb/> underpinning the baselines or reference levels is needed in order to understand the expected impact of the<lb/> contributions. For land sector contributions in the form of qualitative policies and measures in developing<lb/> countries, information could be provided on how evidence of progress in implementation will be measured,<lb/> reported and domestically verified.<lb/></p>

			<p>The provisions for up-front information could also provide an opportunity to report non-carbon benefits of<lb/> the actions proposed. For the land sector, these could include ecosystem-based adaptation, climate-smart<lb/> agriculture and the creation of climate-resilient landscapes. Such information would help to provide<lb/> context for how nationally determined contributions fit within broader visions for the land sector, as well<lb/> as links between mitigation and adaptation components.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is currently no formal work stream for discussing post-2020 land sector accounting issues under the<lb/> ADP. A space for negotiations on this issue under the ADP is needed if the 2015 agreement is to contain<lb/> provisions relating to land sector reporting and accounting. At COP 20 in Lima in December 2014,<lb/> therefore, Parties could agree to establish a work stream or other formal venue to start discussions on this<lb/> important topic.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 COP 21, Paris<lb/></head>

			<p>At COP 21 in Paris, Parties are to adopt the 2015 agreement which will lay out the shape of the post-2020<lb/> international regime for tackling climate change. The agreement itself may leave some technical details<lb/> regarding the accounting framework to be agreed subsequently in 2016-2020.<lb/></p>

			<p>Parties could agree at COP 21 on the foundations (e.g. underlying principles and/or guidance) for post-<lb/>2020 land sector reporting and accounting. In particular, Parties could agree on the direction of travel for<lb/> land sector reporting and accounting and put the negotiations on a path towards achieving the long-term<lb/> vision outlined in Section 3. Possible foundations that could be included in the 2015 agreement are<lb/> outlined below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reporting<lb/></head>

			<p>• The quality of GHG inventories should be improved over time, with a view to achieving annual<lb/> GHG inventories of key sources and sinks by all Parties (with flexibility for LDCs and SIDSs).<lb/> Parties are to use the 2006 IPCC Guidelines when preparing GHG inventories, to ensure that the<lb/> reported information is as transparent, accurate, complete, consistent and comparable as possible.<lb/> Some developing countries may need enhanced support in terms of finance, technology and<lb/> capacity building to increase their GHG inventory capacity.<lb/> • GHG inventories are to be reviewed or analysed by technical experts, in order to increase<lb/> confidence in the information reported and accelerate the inventory improvement process.<lb/></p>

			<head>32<lb/></head>

			<p>• Qualitative information on landscape management strategies and progress in non-mitigation<lb/> policy areas (such as ecosystem-based adaptation, biodiversity conservation and food security)<lb/> should be reported in national communications and biennial (update) reports to complement the<lb/> quantitative accounting framework. In the case of some supported actions in developing<lb/> countries, qualitative information on social and environmental safeguards should be reported.<lb/></p>

			<head>Accounting<lb/></head>

			<p>• The direction of travel for all Parties should be towards increased coverage over time of key<lb/> categories of anthropogenic GHG sources and sinks from agriculture, forestry and other land-use<lb/> change in accounting for mitigation contributions, taking into account the different starting points<lb/> and capabilities of Parties.<lb/> • The &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule is to be applied to accounting for land sector sub-sectors.<lb/> • Both GHG emissions and removals from the land sector are to be accounted for.<lb/> • Accounting approaches are to be cost-effective and avoid perverse incentives (see e.g. New<lb/> Zealand, 2014b).<lb/> • Technical assessment cycles are to be established for the baselines or reference levels used for<lb/> accounting purposes, with the aim of increasing confidence in the baselines or reference levels<lb/> against which progress in implementation is measured.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 2016-2020<lb/></head>

			<p>In an ideal world, the rules and details of a reporting and accounting framework would be agreed before<lb/> the intended nationally determined contributions themselves are put forward. However, given the short<lb/> time remaining until COP 21, these processes may need to take place in parallel and negotiations on some<lb/> details could continue in the period 2016-2020. Issues that could continue to be worked on in 2016-2020<lb/> include: guidance for reference levels (including how these could promote sustainable development),<lb/> treatment of non-permanence and natural disturbances, identification of anthropogenic emissions and<lb/> removals, and the role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms under the UNFCCC.<lb/> A distinction can be made between tools and rules. For example, IPCC Guidelines can be considered a set<lb/> of tools designed to increase the accuracy and comparability of GHG inventories. The COP subsequently<lb/> adopted rules stipulating which IPCC Guidelines are to be used by which Parties. Similarly, it could be<lb/> helpful to develop a set of additional tools in 2016-2020 that facilitate land sector reporting and accounting<lb/> by all Parties. In the absence of agreement of rules on land sector reporting and accounting, Parties could<lb/> opt in to use such tools voluntarily. Such tools could be developed by non-State actors through consultative<lb/> processes and subsequently adopted as de facto standards by the UNFCCC process later. For example,<lb/> guidelines developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre were used voluntarily by 14<lb/> countries to calculate their FMRLs for the second commitment period (UNFCCC, 2011a).<lb/></p>

			<head>Guidance for reference levels<lb/></head>

			<p>Reference levels could be used to measure progress in implementation of post-2020 nationally determined<lb/> contributions. In particular, the use of reference levels can help to minimise the impact of legacy effects<lb/> and age-class structure for forestry and can potentially be used more broadly to accommodate multiple land<lb/> use objectives, for example by accommodating food production emissions within baselines. Guidance for<lb/> reference levels could be developed in 2016-2020, building on existing guidance for FMRLs under the<lb/> Kyoto Protocol and forest reference levels/forest emissions reference levels for REDD+. A starting point<lb/> could be to identify the elements needed for the construction of reference levels, as well as what should be<lb/> included and what excluded. These elements can include historical data from GHG inventories, policy base<lb/> year, age-class structure (for forests), factoring out anthropogenic effects from natural ones, activities<lb/> already undertaken (if applicable), projected activities under business-as-usual, and continuity of previous<lb/> activities (Hood, <ref type="biblio">Briner and Rocha, 2014</ref>). Guidance would also be needed on aspects such as whether new<lb/> forest or reduced deforestation should be credited, and if so, how much time should pass until they are<lb/> included in the reference level. Countries could also be encouraged to design baselines that create<lb/> synergies with sustainable development and climate change adaptation, while avoiding perverse incentives<lb/> for land management activities.<lb/> Some Parties could also decide to construct reference levels for non-forestry activities, such as agriculture,<lb/> revegetation, cropland management, grazing land management and wetland drainage and rewetting. On<lb/> one hand, a &quot; reference levels for all &quot; approach could provide flexibility and comparability, and new<lb/> lands/activities could be added incrementally (Hood, <ref type="biblio">Briner and Rocha, 2014</ref>). On the other hand, Estrada<lb/> et al. (2014) point out that expanding the reference level idea to other categories could increase<lb/> inconsistency with the type of contribution that a country is adopting for other sectors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-permanence and natural disturbances<lb/></head>

			<p>Options to deal with non-permanence and the risk of reversals of CO 2 removals from forestry and other<lb/> land use are given below. The first two are more relevant to national-scale commitments, the others to<lb/> projects:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Use of GHG inventories as the basis for accounting, with removals counted as removals in the<lb/> year they occur, and any subsequent reversals counted as emissions in the year they occur. This<lb/> would be the simplest and most practical option, but may lead to less ambitious headline numbers<lb/> for nationally determined contributions (<ref type="biblio">Estrada et al., 2014</ref>).<lb/> • Use of a natural disturbances provision, whereby emissions resulting from a natural disturbance<lb/> may be reported but not accounted for by the Party concerned. By 2020, experience will already<lb/> have been accrued with this approach from the second commitment period under the Kyoto<lb/> Protocol.<lb/> • Use of a buffer of GHG emissions reductions from forestry and other land-use changes that is<lb/> backed up by national governments (<ref type="biblio">Ellis, 2001</ref>). When emissions reductions from forestry and<lb/> other land use are achieved, a share of the units generated could be set aside in a buffer. In the<lb/> event of a reversal, units from the buffer could be used to make up the shortfall. While this option<lb/> has been proposed for project-based mechanisms such as the CDM (UNFCCC, 2014d), the<lb/> concept could also be implemented at larger (e.g. sub-national) scales (see Box 3).<lb/> • Issuance of temporary GHG units for removals from forestry and other land-use changes, for use<lb/> by the Party concerned to meet its contribution or to be sold to another Party (<ref type="biblio">Ellis, 2001</ref>). These<lb/> temporary units could expire at the end of the contribution period, or remain valid at the end of<lb/> the contribution period if there is verification that no removals have occurred.<lb/> • Use of insurance mechanisms, whereby the risk of reversals is underwritten by a third party for a<lb/> fee (<ref type="biblio">Murray et al., 2012</ref>). In the event of a reversal, the insurance company would make a<lb/> payment to the Party concerned, and this money could be used to finance an equivalent quantity<lb/> of emissions reductions elsewhere. The inclusion of a third party in the process could result in<lb/> higher transaction fees and the insurance company could contest the fact that the reversal was<lb/> beyond the control of the</p>

			<table>Party concerned.<lb/> Forests are subject to natural disturbances and other changes in forest carbon cycles which remain<lb/> unforeseeable. In order to ensure environmental integrity under a carbon credit regime, buffers can be used as<lb/> part of a comprehensive risk strategy. Buffers are set-aside emission reductions that can be utilised to<lb/> compensate reversals. There are several risks that have emerged under REDD+ that could be addressed via<lb/> buffering mechanisms, including:<lb/> • risk of leakage<lb/> • unclear land tenure<lb/> • risk of methodological errors<lb/> • incorrect assumptions for the construction of reference levels or a MRV framework.<lb/> Emission reductions that are reserved in a buffer pool could be used in the following cases:<lb/> • a natural disturbance such as fire causing a reversal<lb/> • a major mistake in a Party&apos;s accounting system – the buffer could be used to reduce issued emission<lb/> reductions while not affecting traded emission reductions<lb/> • a strong increase in deforestation in neighboring countries which could lead to leakage – in this case<lb/> countries could pool their buffers to share risk.<lb/></table>

			<p>If none of the above risks occur, buffered emission reductions can be converted into credited emission<lb/> reductions after a certain period of time. Further, in the event of a change to a more ambitious global mitigation<lb/> goal, a country could choose to cancel part of its buffer. The use of buffers is comparable to a risk insurance<lb/> system that can incentivise non-carbon benefits. Estimating appropriate buffers can be problematic but if<lb/> recurring over-or under-estimation occurs the buffer can be adjusted accordingly.<lb/> Source: <ref type="biblio">Bucki, 2014; Ellis, 2001<lb/></ref> Identification of anthropogenic emissions and removals<lb/></head>

			<p>The concept of managed and unmanaged land is currently used as a proxy for anthropogenic and natural<lb/> emissions and removals. Options for estimating anthropogenic emissions and removals in the future<lb/> include (IPCC, 2009):<lb/></p>

			<p>• Continued use of the managed land proxy.<lb/> • Quantification of the contribution of different drivers towards emissions and removals in the land<lb/> sector. Scientific methods for doing this are being developed.<lb/> • Comparison between two or more modelled time series representing different levels of human<lb/> land management.<lb/> • Use of default emissions factors for human and natural processes, together with improved<lb/> statistical detection and attribution techniques (known as &quot; optimal fingerprinting &quot; ).<lb/> • Expanded use of the activity-based approach for accounting, to encompass all human activities in<lb/> the land sector that result in GHG emissions or removals. This could potentially be more<lb/> transparently embedded within GHG inventories and a clear mapping provided of how the<lb/> coverage of the activity-based approach relates to that of the land-based approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>An IPCC expert meeting revisited the managed land proxy in May 2009, and concluded at that time that<lb/> continued use of the managed land proxy remained the only practicable method available (IPCC, 2009).<lb/> Nevertheless, the expert meeting also agreed that the managed land proxy &quot; could in the future include an<lb/> increasing proportion of natural and indirect human contributions <ref type="biblio">[</ref>and therefore] work needs to continue to<lb/> identify and test approaches to separating anthropogenic impacts from others &quot; . This topic could be visited<lb/> again in the 2016-2020 period to take stock of scientific advances in this area and to reconsider whether the<lb/> managed land proxy remains the most effective method available.<lb/></table>

			<head>Use of market mechanisms<lb/></head>

			<p>Some Parties may wish to use market mechanisms as a tool to finance and/or incentivise mitigation actions<lb/> in the land sector in the post-2020 period. Further, inclusion of the land sector could also help to create<lb/> deeper and more liquid carbon markets, given the significant abatement potential that exists in this sector.<lb/> The scope and nature of market mechanisms under the UNFCCC in the post-2020 period remains unclear.<lb/> There are currently three parallel streams in the UNFCCC negotiations which could be relevant: (i) the<lb/> new market mechanism, (ii) the framework for various approaches, and (iii) non-market approaches.<lb/> Discussions of all three topics are currently taking place under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and<lb/> Technological Advice (SBSTA). Parties have agreed that these various mechanisms under the UNFCCC<lb/> are to stimulate mitigation across &quot; broad segments of the economy &quot; (UNFCCC, 2012). This is likely to<lb/> include the land sector, particularly in developing countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Confidence in the environmental integrity of tradable GHG units from the land sector could be enhanced<lb/> by robust technical reviews of baselines and reference levels, as under the REDD+ mechanism. Up-front<lb/> information would also be needed on the approach used to deal with non-permanence and the impact of<lb/> natural disturbances. While high standards of environmental integrity would be expected for GHG units<lb/> originating from the land sector, setting the bar for participation too high (e.g. by requiring Tier 3 IPCC<lb/> methodologies for the relevant sources or sinks) would make it challenging for many Parties to participate<lb/> and would risk decreasing the total level of mitigation achieved from this sector. Any guidance or<lb/> development of standards could draw on experience to date under the UNFCCC as well as from voluntary<lb/> carbon markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>How emissions and removals from the land sector are reported and accounted for in the post-2020 period<lb/> will have a significant influence on the effectiveness of the 2015 agreement. This is because CO 2 , CH 4 and<lb/> N 2 O emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use are the second largest source of anthropogenic<lb/> GHG emissions after the energy sector (IPCC, 2014a). In particular, non-CO 2 emissions from agriculture<lb/> are rising rapidly and are now a greater GHG contributor than deforestation (<ref type="biblio">Christ, 2014</ref>). Moreover,<lb/> there is significant emissions abatement potential in the global land sector. This abatement potential is<lb/> enhanced by the fact that, in some cases, forestry and other land use can act as a net sink of CO 2 .<lb/></p>

			<p>The LULUCF part of the land sector has several features that make it different to other sectors. These<lb/> include strong legacy effects due to forest structure, and risk of natural disturbances causing reversals of<lb/> carbon removals by land sinks. Further, both agriculture and LULUCF can have multiple competing policy<lb/> objectives and relatively high uncertainty associated with estimates of emissions and removals. A cost-<lb/>effective reporting and accounting framework is needed that respects these important differences, while<lb/> enabling governments to gain recognition for nationally determined mitigation actions undertaken in the<lb/> land sector.<lb/> Accounting in the context of the UNFCCC is more than simply a book-keeping exercise. The accounting<lb/> framework can provide incentives to pursue some actions and not others. An accounting framework is<lb/> needed that incentivises governments to undertake as much mitigation in the land sector as possible, while<lb/> meeting other policy objectives such as adaptation, preservation of biodiversity, food security and poverty<lb/> alleviation.<lb/> Several reporting and accounting frameworks for the land sector currently exist. These include reporting of<lb/> anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals under the Convention, reporting and accounting for<lb/> agriculture and LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol, reporting and accounting for afforestation<lb/> and reforestation projects under the CDM, and reporting on REDD+. There is no internationally-agreed<lb/> accounting framework for the mitigation targets and actions put forward for 2020 under the Cancun<lb/> Agreements, or for the intended nationally determined contributions put forward for the post-2020 period.<lb/> In many cases how the land sector component of these targets and actions will be accounted for remains<lb/> unclear.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some areas there are overlaps between existing reporting and accounting systems in terms of coverage.<lb/> For example, afforestation and reforestation activities are covered by the LULUCF, CDM and REDD+<lb/> arrangements under the Kyoto Protocol. In other areas there are differences; for example, CH 4 and N 2 O<lb/> emissions from agriculture are included in the reporting and accounting framework for Annex B Parties,<lb/> but no internationally-agreed accounting framework for agriculture (or any other sector) currently exists<lb/> for non-KP Annex I Parties or developing countries. In future, convergence between these various work<lb/> streams could lead to a simpler and more comprehensive land sector reporting and accounting system.<lb/></p>

			<p>A long-term vision for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting is laid out in this paper, building on<lb/> recent studies on land sector accounting and the 2015 agreement. The vision is of a land sector reporting<lb/> and accounting framework that is applicable to all countries, taking into account their national<lb/> circumstances. The framework would encourage countries to take on increasing responsibility for<lb/> emissions and removals in the land sector over time as cost-effectively as possible. It would create<lb/> incentives to move towards greater coverage of key sources, both in terms of reporting and accounting, and<lb/> would not penalise countries for their initial starting points. Some developing countries would need<lb/> capacity building to improve the quality and accuracy of their GHG reporting and accounting systems.<lb/></p>

			<p>The coverage of the future land sector reporting and accounting framework should include as many key<lb/> sources and sinks as possible. This would help to avoid &quot; cherry-picking &quot; of mitigation activities, provide<lb/> incentives to take a holistic approach to mitigation in the land sector and help to ensure that the reporting<lb/> and accounting framework reflects only anthropogenic impacts on sources and sinks. It will take time to<lb/> achieve a broad reporting and accounting framework. Therefore Parties could gradually increase coverage<lb/> over time on a &quot; once in, always in &quot; basis.<lb/></p>

			<p>At present there is not an internationally-agreed approach for setting baselines or reference levels for the<lb/> land sector in the post-2020 period. Therefore a high level of up-front transparency is needed to ensure<lb/> clarity and understanding of the intended nationally determined contributions proposed. Up-front<lb/> information on the assumptions and calculations used to construct baselines or reference levels, coupled<lb/> with technical expert review of the reference levels as under the existing Kyoto Protocol and REDD+<lb/> mechanisms, could help to achieve this.<lb/> Near-term steps could be taken at COP 20 and beyond to put Parties on a pathway towards achieving the<lb/> long-term vision outlined in this draft paper. At COP 20 in Lima, Parties could agree to create a work<lb/> stream under the ADP to discuss land sector accounting issues and decide on the up-front information to be<lb/> provided alongside intended nationally determined contributions in the land sector, including information<lb/> on the assumptions underlying reference levels. At COP 21 in Paris, Parties could agree to lay out a set of<lb/> foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting as part of the 2015 agreement. Possible<lb/> elements for such foundations could include agreement that:<lb/></p>

			<p>• All Parties are to use IPCC 2006 Guidelines for reporting (with different Parties using different<lb/> tiers for different sources and sinks, according to capacity)<lb/> • The coverage of land sector accounting in terms of gases and lands should be expanded over<lb/> time, using the &quot; once in, always in &quot; rule, with a view to achieving broad coverage of key sources<lb/> of GHG emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land uses.<lb/> • Option to use reference levels and/or intensity metrics to track progress towards mitigation<lb/> contributions relating to agriculture, forestry and soils, with a view to providing cost-effective<lb/> accounting options that take into account national circumstances.<lb/> • Technical assessments cycles are to be undertaken for intended baselines or reference levels,<lb/> building on existing technical review processes under the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+.<lb/> • Qualitative information is to be provided on environmental and social safeguards ( and efforts to<lb/> pursue holistic landscape-based approaches such as ecosystem-based adaptation and climate-<lb/>smart agriculture, to complement the quantitative accounting framework.<lb/> • Flexibility in some aspects of the reporting and accounting framework and acceptance of<lb/> different entry points for different countries, to accommodate the different national circumstances<lb/> and capacities of countries.<lb/> • Enhanced capacity building is needed in developing countries to improve reporting and<lb/> accounting capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Once the basic foundations for post-2020 land sector reporting and accounting have been established, work<lb/> could be undertaken on the more technical details in the period 2016-2020. Further issues to be addressed<lb/> in this period could include guidance for reference levels, how to deal with reversals caused by natural<lb/> disturbances or indirect human effects, how to separate anthropogenic from natural emissions and<lb/> removals, the role of the land sector in market and non-market mechanisms, and consideration of how<lb/> multiple objectives can be accommodated in mitigation accounting (e.g. consideration of alternative<lb/> approaches to agriculture accounting that are compatible with food production objectives).<lb/></p>
