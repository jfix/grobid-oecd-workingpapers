			<body>1. <lb/>INTRODUCTION <lb/>The traditional role of patents is to provide their holder with an exclusionary power on the use of a <lb/>particular invention. As evidenced in different business surveys, certain patents, instead, are filed by firms <lb/>in order to prevent others to obtain this power (Cohen et al., 2002; Duguet and Kabla, 1999; Blind et al., <lb/>2006). The use of patents aimed at preventing other parties to obtain a patent on a related invention points <lb/>to the central role of patents in the technology and market strategy of firms. <lb/>In this paper we aim at identifying patent applications which are used to pre-empt others from getting <lb/>their patents granted. We evaluate the idea that generating prior art through the patent system may act as a <lb/>barrier to entry into a technology field for potential or actual rivals. Patent applications can be used as <lb/>defensive strategic mechanisms to prevent the grant of exclusive rights on markets and technologies to <lb/>others while ensuring freedom of operation to their applicants (De Rassenfosse and Guellec, 2009). <lb/>Applicants may file patents at the periphery of an important invention with the single purpose of limiting <lb/>patenting of related inventions by others. There is a strategic motivation to disclose inventions for the <lb/>simple reason that it generates prior art: it makes knowledge advances public and not patentable, limiting <lb/>the possibilities for rivals to patent inventions related to the disclosed information. Theory explains that <lb/>disclosure extends the patent race (Baker and Mezzetti, 2005; Bar, 2006) which raises the costs of <lb/>competing (making some firms get out of the race) but allows firms to gain time until a breakthrough <lb/>discovery is made. It can then be attractive for both leaders and follower companies and will depend on <lb/>specific circumstances; how far the lagging firm is in the race; the asymmetry between firms in investment <lb/>costs, etc. We hypothesise that if pre-emption of patenting of related inventions by others is the main <lb/>purpose, disclosure through the simple publication of a patent application can be enough to fulfil this <lb/>objective. Applicants would file patent applications &quot; defensively &quot; to make sure they are generating visible <lb/>prior art, which is likely to compromise the novelty of other applications, and may subsequently abandon <lb/>the patent process once the goal is achieved. Withdrawn applications can thus be characterised as mainly <lb/>defensive, as they endow their owner with no exclusive right per se (as no patent is granted) but are <lb/>depriving their competitors of a legal means to limit freedom of operation on the market. <lb/>The increasing patenting activity worldwide (it has more than doubled in the United States and in <lb/>Europe since the mid-1990s) suggests that businesses are devoting more resources to protect their <lb/>intellectual property with patents or to defend themselves against the patents of others. In this setting, pre-<lb/>emptive patenting strategies would be both an outcome and a factor of the increasing number of patent <lb/>applications: they are partly a reaction to the growing number of applications which might hamper the <lb/>freedom to operate of businesses, and they contribute themselves to the patents &quot; arms race &quot; by triggering <lb/>in turn reactions of competitors. 1 Even if the patentee does not himself plan to pursue patent protection (get <lb/>a grant), defensive patenting can be an important instrument to ensure market exclusion and preserve <lb/>freedom to operate and thereby appropriation of economic returns from actual patented inventions. <lb/>We provide new empirical evidence on the functioning and characteristics of pre-emptive patents, <lb/>understood as patents that are filed to hamper the patentability of other inventions. There are several <lb/>motivations underlying this investigation. First of all, there is ample anecdotal and survey evidence <lb/>pointing to the existence of strategic blocking but few statistical analyses at the patent level have been done <lb/>to date to explore these issues. The empirical examination of pre-emptive patenting is important to the <lb/>extent that these strategies are fundamentally conceived to ensure and/or preserve market exclusion which <lb/>is the first reason to patent. Second, research on the role of withdrawals as pre-emptive mechanisms hardly <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 <lb/>The effect of this kind of patents on the overall quality of the patent system is however not clear: on the <lb/>one hand, they can help maintain the quality of granted patents, when they hamper the patentability of bad <lb/>applications; on the other hand, they may be of relatively low quality themselves. <lb/></note>

			<body>exists. A common assumption in survey studies is that strategic purposes are associated to patents that are <lb/>granted, that is, applicants always finalise the patenting process. This paper will show that this is not <lb/>necessarily the case, as having a grant is not always needed in order to hamper the grant of other patents. <lb/>Lastly, statistical evidence of the importance of this type of patents in total patenting activity (i.e. over time <lb/>and across technologies), their functioning and characteristics is almost nonexistent. This paper attempts to <lb/>fill these gaps. <lb/>Combining data from prior art and examination outcomes, we develop a methodology to identify <lb/>patent filings consistent with pre-emption motivations. Patent data can be helpful in shedding light on the <lb/>strategic behaviour by applicants and the use of the patent system and is therefore complementary to <lb/>anecdotal evidence and survey-based studies. We analyse search and examination outcomes of patent <lb/>applications filed to the European Patent Office (EPO) between 1990 and 2000 and relate them to the <lb/>different categories assigned by examiners in the search reports to determine patentability. We exploit the <lb/>information provided by patent examiners in search reports of prior art, where patent references are <lb/>labelled as: i) relevant to the state of the art (cited as A), or ii) compromising the patentability of the citing <lb/>application (cited as X, Y or E). One application can be both cited as i) in certain cases and as ii) in other <lb/>cases. Based on this information, we investigate the existence of pre-emptive practices in patenting by <lb/>looking at the influence of patent references on the fate of other (citing) patents and relate this impact to <lb/>the technical contribution of cited patent references and their administrative status (i.e. pending, <lb/>withdrawn, granted, refused). <lb/>The paper is organised as follows. After some background information and a literature survey, we <lb/>present our empirical model aiming to identify pre-emptive power in cited references. A multinomial <lb/>model is conducted to identify relations between certain classes of patent references cited in search reports <lb/>and the likelihood of refusal and withdrawal of their corresponding citing patents. Once the type of <lb/>references with the strongest &quot; pre-emptive power &quot; are identified, we proceed to characterise them by <lb/>comparing attributes with other types of filings with the aid of probit models. Based on the literature on the <lb/>value of patents, we compare characteristics of inventions such as scope, research costs (number of <lb/>inventors), cumulativeness of invention and scientific content. Sector-specific analyses are also conducted <lb/>for biotechnology-pharmaceuticals and electronics. Lessons and policy implications are discussed at the <lb/>end. <lb/>2. <lb/>BACKGROUND <lb/>2.1. <lb/>Pre-emptive patenting <lb/>Defensive patenting is used by firms to secure freedom to operate while at the same serves to exclude <lb/>others from markets (De Rassenfosse and Guellec, 2009). 2 It can be used by a firm to prevent an invention <lb/>related to one of its own inventions from being patented by a rival. Defensive patents are essentially <lb/>conceived to keep others off a specific technology by reducing their expected profit from investing in it <lb/>(raising entry barriers). To pre-empt the entry of others into a technology field (and market) a firm wishing <lb/>to protect some patented core invention may also patent &quot; substitutes &quot; to foreclose that possibility to rivals <lb/>(e.g. chemicals and pharmaceuticals). A firm can indeed try to prevent attacks through building patent <lb/>fences to protect a specific core technology, filing a number of patents to protect closely related and even <lb/>2 <lb/>While there is no agreed definition of strategic (in contrast to traditional) patenting, most experts recognise <lb/>two main orientations, offensive and defensive (Arundel and Patel, 2003; Shapiro, 2006). Offensive <lb/>patenting is conceived to threaten, attack and weaken others. It can be used to prevent competitors from <lb/>using a technology or to restrain their freedom to operate by filing patents at the margin of their areas of <lb/>activity (covering incremental innovations on its periphery). Hence offensive patents can serve to leverage <lb/>opportunistic licensing deals or advantageous settlement conditions from litigation threats (Shapiro, 2006), <lb/>a practice known as the business core of the so-called &quot; patent trolls &quot; . <lb/></body>

			<body>overlapping inventions. In some cases, the firm may have no intention of commercialising those inventions <lb/>and aims exclusively at pre-empting entry. <lb/>The motivation for pre-emptive patenting has been analysed in the theoretical economic literature. <lb/>When entry into an industry can only take place through the invention and patenting of a substitute for a <lb/>monopolist´s product, Gilbert and Newbery (1982) show that it is rational for the incumbent, under certain <lb/>conditions, to pre-empt entry of potential competitors by patenting the substitute and letting the patent <lb/>sleep (by neither producing the protected invention nor licensing the patent) when it is not profitable to <lb/>produce both the original product and the substitute. Patenting a substitute technology would always be <lb/>valuable to the incumbent because it preserves monopoly profits, which typically exceed the duopoly <lb/>profits that the incumbent would obtain with entry. 3 <lb/>Empirical studies investigating the strategic uses of patents are often based on qualitative information <lb/>(company declaration of uses) coming from business surveys, where strategic motives, such as blocking <lb/>competitors and preventing suits, are usually amongst the top motivations to patent, right after the <lb/>traditional motive of protecting inventions from imitations. According to the Carnegie Mellon Survey <lb/>results in the United States and Japan, the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions, which <lb/>they call patent blocking, is found to be the most pervasive motive for patenting after the prevention of <lb/>imitation for 82% of United States and 93% of Japanese respondents (Cohen et al., 2002). 4 Accordingly, <lb/>defensive patenting is motivated notably when inventions held by different owners are related ( &quot; economic <lb/>complements &quot; ); that is, when, to create a single commercialisable product, separately patentable inventions <lb/>need to be combined, which is commonly the case in complex product industries. 5 In such cases, holding a <lb/>patent on one of these elements can block the acquisition of exclusive property rights over the <lb/>commercialisable invention as a whole. <lb/>Using information from the US Carnegie Mellon survey, Ceccagnoli (2008) shows that pre-emption <lb/>-declared by companies as the motivation to patent -tends to improve remarkably the appropriability of <lb/>returns to R&amp;D (especially for incumbents with strong market power and facing high threats of entry), as <lb/>evidenced by the positive impact on the stock market valuation of a firm&apos;s R&amp;D assets. Hence investors <lb/>price the reinforced value of assets when market power is protected with entry foreclosure, consistently <lb/>with the theoretical predictions of Gilbert and Newbery. <lb/>3 <lb/>By the same logic, in the absence of ex-ante market power there would be no incentive to pre-empt for <lb/>incumbents because profits with pre-emption, net of R&amp;D and patenting costs, would always be negative. <lb/>For the pre-emption threat to be credible, the incumbent needs to commit the R&amp;D needed to develop the <lb/>innovation even if it is profitable not to employ the innovation once produced. Another basic result from <lb/>the pre-emptive patenting model of Gilbert and Newbery is that the more drastic the underlying innovation <lb/>on which the R&amp;D competition is based, the lower the incentives for and the profits with pre-emptive <lb/>patenting. <lb/>4 <lb/>In France, Duguet and Kabla (1998) find that securing technological room to manoeuvre is the decisive <lb/>driving force behind strategic patenting. Defensive blocking and improving negotiation positions were <lb/>named by 62% of all enterprises as reasons for patenting. In Germany, Blind et al. (2006) find that <lb/>defensive blockage of competitors (i.e. securing own technological flexibility) is deemed important for <lb/>72% of companies, while offensive blockage of competitors (i.e. hindering competitors from technological <lb/>developments) is deemed important by 69%. <lb/>5 <lb/>In the US semiconductor industry, Hall and Ziedonis (2001) report evidence that the surge in the patent <lb/>propensities of firms since early 1980s (since the &quot; pro-patent&quot; shift) was mainly driven by the aggressive <lb/>defensive patenting activities of large-scale manufacturing firms as well as the increased reliance on <lb/>patents by entrants. <lb/></body>

			<body>Alternatively, some researchers have started to rely on information contained in patent documents, <lb/>such as filing procedures and citations, to investigate strategic behaviour in patenting. 6 Some studies use <lb/>citation categories in EPO search reports, notably those compromising patentability of new inventions (X, <lb/>Y and E citations) to infer &quot; blocking strategies &quot; by applicants. Harhoff et al., (2008) propose measures of <lb/> &quot; mutually blocking &quot; patent strategies between companies based on the identity of the applicants of &quot; critical <lb/>references &quot; , that is, &quot; classified as limiting the patentability of the invention to be patented &quot; . 7 Grimpe and <lb/>Hussinger (2008) evaluate the &quot; blocking potential &quot; of patent portfolios based on the number of conflicting <lb/>forward citations they received and find that the deal value of a target in merger and acquisitions in Europe <lb/>increases with the blocking potential of its patent portfolio. <lb/>Our study pertains to the latter lines of research, relying on information contained in patent documents <lb/>to infer strategic applicant behaviour. We differentiate from them in looking at the examination resolutions <lb/>and the characteristics of the (patent) prior art to infer pre-emption motivations. We look in particular at <lb/>the technical contribution and legal status of cited patent references, aspects whose combined analysis has <lb/>so far been neglected. <lb/>2.2. <lb/>Withdrawing pre-emptive patent filings <lb/>An important distinction between offensive and defensive patents is that the latter do not need to be <lb/>legally strong to fulfil their pre-emptive role – they just need to disclose the relevant information. 8 <lb/>Defensive patents do not need to be granted, as the uncertainty created by their filing and disclosure may <lb/>serve their objectives without it being necessary to assert them in court. When this is the case, defensive <lb/>patenting can be compared with other types of disclosures such as publishing inventions using commercial <lb/>disclosure services or specialised journals. 9 <lb/>However, patents differ from other means traditionally used for defensive disclosures in a number of <lb/>important aspects: i) using patent filings to disclose inventions keeps the possibility open for the applicant <lb/>to seek patent protection on outcomes from forward or parallel research (if patentability criteria are <lb/>accomplished), whereas defensive publishing (i.e. journals, Internet) destroys the novelty of an invention <lb/>and thus prevents patenting (or raises the patentability threshold) for all, including its inventor; ii) the <lb/>patent applicant can use the &quot; pending patent &quot; condition to his advantage from the moment of filing <lb/>6 <lb/>Graham and Mowery (2004) find evidence on the strategic use of patent application procedures by <lb/>applicants in the United States through the system of continuation applications. Other studies suggest that <lb/>challenging the validity of patents in opposition procedures at EPO or re-examination procedures at <lb/>USPTO is not only related to value but also to strategic motivations (see Harhoff and Hall, 2002; for the <lb/>case of comestics). Harhoff and Reitzig (2004) use categories of patent references in their model <lb/>explaining the likelihood of EPO opposition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, finding that if <lb/>the validity of patents granted had been questioned by the examiner (by including conflicting references in <lb/>their search report), third parties have more ground to challenge them through the opposition system. They <lb/>concluded that the likelihood of opposition increases with patent value and is particularly frequent in areas <lb/>with strong patenting activity and with high technical or market uncertainty. <lb/>7 <lb/>Page 15 in Harhoff et al., (2008). <lb/>8 <lb/>Offensive blocking aims to ensure or strengthen the control of the blocking party over a technical field, <lb/>which can happen through various channels. If the blocking patent is granted, it gives exclusionary power <lb/>to its holder, hence direct control, as well as enforceability in the face of potential infringements or to <lb/>leverage licensing agreements. <lb/></body>

			<body>(e.g. trying to signal that he has a large likelihood of getting a grant and may thus be able to claim damages <lb/>in the future if there is infringement); iii) patent applications are the most visible type of prior art to patent <lb/>examiners; iv) patent filings have an incontestable time stamp; v) the contribution to prior art is made when <lb/>the application is published, usually 18 months after filing, frequently long before its examination is <lb/>completed or even started, and irrespective of the application being withdrawn or pursued to the end (the <lb/>applicant can withdraw or abandon the patent application); vi) EPO and PCT (Patent Co-operation Treaty) <lb/>filing fees represent a very small share of the full costs associated with getting patent protection (at EPO <lb/>the lion&apos;s share corresponds to the cost of validating protection at the national level after granting); <lb/>vii) drafting claims in a patent application may be a more effective way to define the scope of an invention <lb/>in legal terms than its description in a journal; and lastly, viii) drafting a patent is usually more costly than <lb/>describing a technical disclosure; it requires a combination of technical and legal expertise at a cost which <lb/>needs to be incurred in addition to patent filing fees and other related costs. <lb/>Recent theoretical studies have shown that defensive publishing may be used by firms to extend the <lb/>patent race because it can help gain time by raising the patentability threshold and thus delay patent filings <lb/>until further research is done (Baker and Mezzetti, 2005; Bar, 2006). For a firm trailing behind, a longer <lb/>race might offer an opportunity to catch up, while for a leading firm, extending the race raises the costs of <lb/>competing, which will in certain circumstances discourage the laggard from racing so aggressively (Baker <lb/>and Mezzetti, 2005). In particular, a firm that holds a patent over a core technology may find it worthwhile <lb/>to publish in order to enjoy the stream of payoffs from that patent for a longer period of time. 10 Yet the <lb/>empirical evidence on these propositions or on the importance of these practices in firms&apos; patenting <lb/>strategies is hardly existent. <lb/>Henkel and Pangerl (2008) in one of the few existing empirical studies of defensive disclosures, based <lb/>on interviews to German firms, show that defensive publishing, understood as an &quot; insurance against being <lb/>excluded from use of the respective technology &quot; , is widely practiced through a variety of methods <lb/>including the patent system (firms use specialised internet providers, peer-reviewed journals or public <lb/>notice boards, etc.). Eleven companies out of 37 (30% of their sample), most of them large ones, claimed <lb/>to practice defensive publications systematically by filing patent applications (i.e. applying for a national <lb/>patent and then letting the application lapse, so that it is deemed withdrawn by the patent office). One of <lb/>the largest German firms interviewed recognised that it published defensively about 30% of its inventions <lb/>using the patent system this way. <lb/>There are several economic advantages associated with withdrawals as a means for defensive <lb/>patenting compared to other forms of strategic patenting such as offensive patents – which are more likely <lb/>to be granted. Withdrawals may imply a less costly strategy to deter entry by others into patenting: <lb/>applicants can withdraw the patent application once the goal of generating prior art is achieved (without <lb/>incurring all the costs required to continue the patent process). 11 In addition, the level of R&amp;D investment <lb/>needed to make the pre-emption threat credible may be lower than when the objective is to get a grant, as <lb/>10 <lb/>When the firms bear different investment costs, the low cost firm may gain from publishing if by <lb/>prolonging the race it drives the high cost firm out of the race (Bar, 2006). This also demonstrates that a <lb/>lagging firm may have stronger incentives to disclose to prevent the leader from having the patent, the <lb/>farther it is in a race and the closer the rival is to winning. <lb/></body>

			<body>the filing can be done earlier in the process, when the invention is not yet mature, or be done simply by <lb/>repackaging prior art. 12 <lb/>Naturally, a significant number of withdrawals correspond to filings that do not embody sufficient <lb/>novelty to be deemed patentable in the view of the applicant or the EPO, possibly after a communication <lb/>from the examiner about the high likelihood of refusal. Induced withdrawals or anticipated refusals occur <lb/>for up to 23% of all applications at the EPO (Stevnsborg and Van Pottelsberghe, 2007). In fact, Lazaridis <lb/>and Van Pottelsbergue (2006) show that up to 54% of withdrawals at the EPO may be considered as <lb/>induced by the work of examiners (i.e. withdrawals that occur just after the search report or after the <lb/>communication that takes place during the substantial examination process) and can be then interpreted as <lb/>anticipated refusals. <lb/>There is recent statistical evidence that withdrawals are associated with defensive purposes (amongst <lb/>other reasons). The EPO Applicant Panel Survey 2007 report contains a small section on the reasons for <lb/>withdrawals where telecommunications, followed by civil engineering and thermodynamics, appear as the <lb/>fields where the defensive component is more widespread (during 2006, 99% of applicants in <lb/>telecommunications and 32% in civil engineering and thermodynamics who had withdrawn filings, <lb/>declared that 21-50% of their withdrawals were done defensively). 13 In contrast, biotechnology and <lb/>chemicals are the fields where defensive withdrawals are more frequent, but the practice is concentrated in <lb/>fewer firms (8% of applicants in biotechnology, pure and applied organic chemistry and polymers with <lb/>defensive withdrawals during 2006 report that 51-80% of their withdrawals were defensive). 14 <lb/>3. <lb/>DATA <lb/>We analyse patent filings at the EPO over the period 1990-2000 and, combining information on <lb/>examination outcomes and cited prior art, develop a methodology to identify pre-emptive patent filings <lb/>(i.e. having the capacity to hamper the grant of other patents). We investigate whether pre-emptive effects <lb/>can be related to the patent references (backward citations) found in the search reports of patent <lb/>applications. <lb/>Our main source is the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) April 2007 edition. <lb/>Information on citations, application authority, country of origin of the applicant and (earliest) priority <lb/>12 <lb/>On the contrary, strategic patents with an offensive content -as they would more concern patents aiming at <lb/>putting obstacles to others in order to raise profitable opportunities or force technology exchanges (a tax <lb/>over other inventions), might imply the following conditions are credible: the applicant can afford the <lb/>(high) costs of patenting and is capable of supporting the costs until the granting; the applicant has <lb/> &quot; credible &quot; R&amp;D capabilities to continue research, and even more important; the applicant has proven <lb/>resources (and experience) in assuming litigation and transaction costs. <lb/>13 <lb/>In the European Applicant Panel Survey (2007) the reasons for withdrawal listed are: not complying with <lb/>formal requirements, not achieving patentability criteria, e.g. novelty, non-obviousness and industrial <lb/>applicability (i.e. discouraging search report written by EPO, negative communications sent out by EPO <lb/>during substantive examination), reduction of the scope of the invention required by the EPO (which <lb/>translates into less economic expectations), disclosure of new prior art during the substantive examination <lb/>of the file, defense through disclosure, fading perceived economic importance of the invention and other <lb/>reasons. The most frequent reasons for withdrawal are: not complying with formal requirements, <lb/>discouraging search report written by the EPO, and negative communications sent out by the EPO during <lb/>substantive examination. <lb/>14 <lb/>The document does not report total percentages of withdrawn filings by motivation. The results of the EPO <lb/>Applicant Panel Survey 2007 on Future Filings (European Patent Office, 2008), addressed to a <lb/>representative sample of applicants having filed patents at EPO in 2006, and can be found at www.epo.org. <lb/>Results referred to here can be found in Tables 95 and 96, pp.106-107. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>years comes from PATSTAT. Other EPO sources have been used to draw information on the main IPC <lb/>class (first one listed). Information on refusals and withdrawals, not included in PATSTAT, was extracted <lb/>from other EPO sources and includes up-to-date information, as of May 2007, on the status of published <lb/>European Patent (EP) filings before that date. 15 <lb/>The search reports for direct EPO applications and for international applications filed at EPO to <lb/>follow the PCT route at WIPO are a very rich source of information about potentially conflicting <lb/>interactions between patents and the motivations of patent holders. They provide information on the state <lb/>of the art relevant for the patentability of the patent application. The fact that guidelines explicitly require <lb/>examiners to be objective and selective in the documents referenced in their prior art search, makes search <lb/>reports even more suitable to monitor state of the art that affects the patentability of new inventions, <lb/>distinguishing between conflicting and relevant prior art (Michel and Bettels, 2001; Webb et al., 2005). <lb/>Patent examiners classify relevant prior art in order to characterise the novelty and inventive step of <lb/>the claimed invention. Citation categories X, Y and E designate prior patent art that compromises the <lb/>novelty and patentability of new applications, whereas citation category A corresponds to patent references <lb/>that are relevant to the state of the art (see Annex 1 for more information). Patent references cited under the <lb/>X citation category would be the most important ones to invalidate the novelty or inventiveness of one or <lb/>more claims within a patent application. If the search report of an application includes a patent reference <lb/>categorised as X associated to a particular claim or claims, it means that the application does not meet the <lb/>requirements of novelty or inventive step with respect to that claim or claims. After receiving the search <lb/>report, the applicant could withdraw the application in view of an anticipated refusal, or revise those claims <lb/>in an attempt to obtain patent protection for other parts of the invention, or proceed with the application <lb/>without changing anything, hoping for a grant regardless of the unfavourable prior art search report. <lb/>4. <lb/>EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION <lb/>We consider that pre-empted applications would be filings for which patent protection has been <lb/>refused by the patent office or which are directly withdrawn by applicants before a decision is reached at <lb/>the office. We would expect them to have more patent citations indicating conflicting prior art than granted <lb/>patents, but the question is whether those citations are conflicting because they represent a relevant <lb/>contribution to the art and thus &quot; naturally &quot; block further filings, or because they were strategically <lb/>designed to limit patentability in a specific field. <lb/>We make a distinction between the following four categories of patent applications based on their full <lb/>history of forward citations: the non-cited (do not appear as a reference in any later filing at EPO); the <lb/>&apos;Pure-X&apos; patent references (cited only as conflicting, i.e. in the X, Y or E category), the &apos;Pure-A&apos; patent <lb/>references (cited only as state of the art, i.e. in the A category) and the &apos;X&amp;A&apos; patent references (cited both <lb/>as conflicting and state of the art in subsequent filings). Our category of interest is Pure-X, that is, <lb/>applications cited for compromising (partially or completely) the patentability of other applications, which <lb/>have never been cited as a reference to the general state of the art. It is therefore likely that their <lb/>contribution to the state of the art is not commensurate to their ability to prevent patenting by others. We <lb/>investigate the relative capacity of Pure-X cited applications to hamper the grant of other patents by <lb/>looking at the procedural outcome of their citing applications. We also examine whether their pre-emptive <lb/>power changes depending on their own procedural status: withdrawn, refused, granted or pending. As <lb/>15 <lb/>EPO applications filed during that period but with no patent references in their search reports (because <lb/>their search report only included non-patent literature references or their search report has not been issued <lb/>yet, for example) or which were still pending by May 2007 (no examination decision taken at the EPO yet, <lb/>no withdrawal by the applicant either) are excluded from our analysis. As we are interested in specific <lb/>types of conflicting and state-of-the-art references, applications lacking patent references are excluded. <lb/></body>

			<body>mentioned above, we expect some filings that are withdrawn (and more likely within pure-X applications) <lb/>to be associated with pre-emptive filing strategies of applicants, that is, filing patents solely for defensive <lb/>purposes. <lb/>Two points need to be mentioned concerning our methodology and results. First, the &quot; most powerful <lb/>pre-emptive patents &quot; are not necessarily observed (or easily observed) with the aid of patent data as they <lb/>will simply deter further patenting by other firms in the surrounding protected area. It is of course more <lb/>difficult to interpret the absence of patents in a given area than to interpret the information provided by <lb/>actual patent filings, and we only do the latter in this study. Further understanding is needed of the nature <lb/>of these patents and how to identify them. In this study, we focus on tractable patent filings that might aim <lb/>at pre-empting the patentability of other patent applications, based on the search reports provided by patent <lb/>examiners. Second, we would like to control for the nature itself of the invention regarding its quality (but <lb/>given the nature of data and the definition of categories of analysis, the inclusion of variables such as <lb/>forward citation would introduce redundancy in the models; e.g. see Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2001; <lb/>Harhoff et al., 1999); or other variables signalling technological importance such as patent family size <lb/>(Putnam, 1996), and account for other patent characteristics such as broadness of the invention; <lb/>e.g. number of claims (Lerner, 1994), etc. <lb/>We should recall that given that some of these variables are frequently a result of the examination <lb/>(e.g. granted patents have a minimum threshold of quality as they accomplish the requirement of novelty <lb/>and inventive step), we are confronted with simultaneity between outcomes of examination and <lb/>characteristics of patents. Further, neither a theoretical framework nor an empirical structural model <lb/>linking all these variables exists to date; given the complexity of such a process. We are focusing here on <lb/>the information contained in the search reports (prior art), which is rather an exogenous factor (and we <lb/>control for technology classes, filing years and country of residence of the applicant). Yet our dummy <lb/>variables on the types of patent references will inevitably absorb effects related to other characteristics of <lb/>the application such as novelty. <lb/>4.1. <lb/>The model <lb/>In order to identify the patent applications with the strongest pre-emptive power, we relate the fate of <lb/>a patent application to the characteristics of the patent references cited in its search report, controlling for <lb/>other aspects of the citing patent application, such as country of residence of applicants, technology field <lb/>and filing year. <lb/>The possible outcomes of a patent application to the EPO with filing years 1990-2000 16 , are defined <lb/>as a categorical dependent variable j: <lb/>j= <lb/>16 <lb/>Although some withdrawals can be considered as anticipated refusals; as long as the decision to abandon <lb/>the patenting process depends on the applicant, we decide to keep it as an outcome separated from refusals. <lb/>1 if the patent application is granted <lb/>2 if the patent application is withdrawn <lb/>3 if the patent application is refused <lb/></body>

			<body>If the error terms are independent and identically Gumbel distributed, with location parameter 0 and <lb/>scale parameter x, the probability that a given patent application results in outcome j is given by: <lb/>∑ <lb/>= <lb/>+ <lb/>= <lb/>= <lb/>2 <lb/>1 <lb/>1 <lb/>) <lb/>| <lb/>Pr( <lb/>k <lb/>x <lb/>x <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>j <lb/>x <lb/>j <lb/>x <lb/>e <lb/>e <lb/>x <lb/>j <lb/>Y <lb/>β <lb/>β <lb/>The multinomial logit model can only be justified under the IIA (Independence of Irrelevant <lb/>Alternatives) assumption (see Greene, 2003); the errors in the random utility model are assumed to be <lb/>independent across choices. 17 In other words, the ratio of the probabilities of any two alternatives is <lb/>independent from the choice set. Hausman and McFadden propose a way to test whether the IIA <lb/>assumption holds. <lb/>4.2. <lb/>Results <lb/>In our sample of 425 582 non-pending citing EPO applications with filing years 1990-2000, 29% of <lb/>the filings contain at least one X patent reference, 21% at least two Y patent references (since they need to <lb/>be cited in combination with other patents, by definition), whereas 71% of applications report A patent <lb/>references. According to our groupings based on the whole history of forward citations, 19% of <lb/>applications cite patent references of the pure-X group and 34% patent references of the X&amp;A group under <lb/>the X category. The most frequent type of patent references consists of X&amp;A patent references cited as A, <lb/>by 46% of the filings, followed by the pure-A, cited by 38%. Summary statistics are given in Table A1 in <lb/>Annex 2. <lb/>Table 1 provides the results for the different multinomial models. Two groups of factors are <lb/>considered and their influence tested on the fate of citing patent applications (granted, refusal and <lb/>withdrawal, with granted as the reference outcome) in two multinomial logit models: i) forward citation <lb/>profiles of patent references; and ii) forward citation profiles and procedural status of the patent references <lb/>(granted, withdrawn, refused, pending). All the independent variables are dummies referring to the fact of <lb/>the citing application having (or not) that type of backward citation in its search report. 18 We control for <lb/>technology fields (seven dummies designating technology areas as defined in the OST-INPI/FhG-ISI <lb/>nomenclature, 2 nd revision; the reference being class 7, construction-consumer goods), filing years of the <lb/>citing patents 1990-2000 (reference being 1990) and country of residence of the first applicant of the citing <lb/>patent (nine country dummies: US, JP, DE, FR, UK, CH, AU, CA and other countries; reference Canada). <lb/>The Small-Hsiao test indicates that the assumption of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives has not been <lb/>violated (the null hypothesis of IIA cannot be rejected). 19 <lb/>17 <lb/>The IIA means first that the odds ratio above does not shift when alternative choices are added. Second, <lb/>when there is a nominal variable that is not really a choice, the IIA assumption says that there are no <lb/>factors affecting the probability that an observation falls into one category that: a) are left unexplained in <lb/>the model of this outcome, and b) also influence the chances that an observation ends up in a different <lb/>category. <lb/></body>

			<div type="acknowledgement">18 <lb/>We have evaluated the model using the number of references belonging to each of those citation groups. <lb/>The results are similar to those obtained with dummy variables. <lb/>19 <lb/>The results of the Small-Hsiao test are: omitted outcome withdrawal: χ2 (29)=29.913 with <lb/>P&gt;χ 2 =0.418; omitted outcome refusal: χ2 (29)=25.170 with P&gt;χ 2 =0.669. <lb/></div>

			<body>In a first model (MNL Model 1 in Table 1: citation profile) we break down patent references into <lb/>different groups according to their forward citation history. 20 Thus, depending on how they are cited <lb/>elsewhere, we distinguish four groups: X/Y/E patent references of the pure-X group, X/Y/E patent <lb/>references of the X&amp;A group, A patent references of the X&amp;A group and A patent references of the pure-A <lb/>group. Absent strategic concerns, we would expect conflicting references which have been cited as <lb/>relevant state of the art in the search reports of other patent applications to have a stronger pre-emptive <lb/>power (e.g. provoking more withdrawals or refusals) than patents which are only cited as conflicting but do <lb/>not appear to be relevant to the state of the art. However, the results of this model contradict such <lb/>expectation, showing clearly that pure-X patent references have a stronger pre-emptive power than their <lb/>counterparts, and by far. More precisely, the probability of withdrawal of a patent application increases by <lb/>almost 8% when it cites at least one pure-X patent reference (probability of refusal increases 0.08%), <lb/>whereas citing as X a patent which has been elsewhere cited as A increases the probability of withdrawal <lb/>by almost 4%. The likelihood of withdrawal for applications with pure-X references is twice as large as <lb/>that of applications with patent references belonging to the X&amp;A group. Patent references of the A <lb/>category, either when they have been cited as X elsewhere or when they have always been cited as A <lb/>(pure-A), diminish the probability of withdrawal of their corresponding citing applications. <lb/>In a second model (MNL Model 2 in Table 1: citation profile and procedural status) we test the <lb/>influence of the procedural status of the three different groups of patent references used in the first model. <lb/>As mentioned earlier, without strategic filings we would expect granted patent references to be associated <lb/>with a higher likelihood of refusals or withdrawals (with respect to grants) of other patent applications than <lb/>withdrawn or refused patent references, or even pending ones, however, estimates indicate that by and <lb/>large the patent references with the strongest pre-emptive power are those withdrawn and belonging to the <lb/>pure-X group of patent references. Paradoxically, the probability of withdrawal increases almost 12% for <lb/>applications having withdrawn patent references of the pure-X group. Further, their impact is significantly <lb/>different from the impact of pure-X granted patent references; and significantly different from the pure-X <lb/>refused. 21 Overall, pure-X patent references have a positive influence on the probability of withdrawal of <lb/>their corresponding citing patent applications, compared to their grant, regardless of their status. 22 <lb/>Interestingly, withdrawal seems to confer a &quot; pre-emptive &quot; trait to other classes of patent references too, as <lb/>withdrawn patent references under the A category also have a positive impact on the probability of <lb/>20 <lb/>We first investigated whether specific types of references are associated individually more strongly with <lb/>citing outcomes. Not surprisingly, estimated marginal effects showed that conflicting references (X, Y and <lb/>E) and state-of-the-art citations (A) have a different incidence on the likelihood of a patent application <lb/>being eventually granted. Having at least one patent reference in a conflicting category increases <lb/>significantly the probability of withdrawal (more than 3% for Y and more than 6% for X and E), whereas it <lb/>is reduced by almost 4% when the patent application has at least one A patent reference, all else equal. <lb/>These results are consistent with the findings of Schneider (2007) showing that withdrawals are more likely <lb/>to occur when there exists conflicting prior art. Results of this regression are available upon request. <lb/>21 <lb/>The χ 2 tests for equality of coefficients are significant at 1%: 450.59 for the former and 19.08, for the latter <lb/>comparison. <lb/>22 <lb/>The coefficient of pending Pure-X references is not significantly different from the coefficients of <lb/>withdrawn Pure-X and refused Pure-X. <lb/></body>

			<body>withdrawal. This main finding holds when we conduct the analysis for two periods (patents being filed <lb/>during the period 1990-1995 and patents being filed during the period 1996-2000). 23 <lb/>5. <lb/>THE PROFILE OF PRE-EMPTIVE PATENT FILINGS <lb/>Let us now characterise those patent applications having the strongest pre-emptive power (Pure-X <lb/>withdrawn) as compared with other applications. First, they have increased over time roughly at the same <lb/>pace as total EPO filings (the share of Pure-X withdrawn has remained at about 3-4% between 1990 and <lb/>2000), which represents a substantial increase given that EPO filings have grown considerably in the past <lb/>years. <lb/>24 Their increase has been in contrast to a decrease in the number of total cited applications and total <lb/>withdrawn applications among the cited. The share of Pure-X withdrawn with respect to all cited has <lb/>passed from 7% in 1990 to 13% in 2000, whereas the share with respect to all withdrawn references has <lb/>increased from 26% to 51%. <lb/>Figure 1. Growth of Pure-X withdrawn patent references <lb/>Filing years 1990-2000 <lb/>Source: PATSTAT, April 2007. <lb/>23 <lb/>The strong pre-emptive power of pending pure-X patent references disappears when we consider filing <lb/>years 1990-1995 for the citing patents. The results of estimating Model 2 on cited status by sub-periods <lb/>(1990-1995 and 1996-2000) with the objective to isolate the influence of truncation due to pending citing <lb/>applications and pending patent references not only confirm the characterisation of pure-X withdrawn as <lb/>the category of patent references with the strongest pre-emptive power, but they also discard the influence <lb/>of pending patent references (of any category) finding it non-significant for the 1990-1995 period. We also <lb/>tested the influence of self-references, finding that the increase in the probability of withdrawal (with <lb/>respect to grant) for applications citing Pure-X patent references is roughly the same for both for self and <lb/>non-self references. <lb/>24 <lb/>Applications appearing as withdrawn in our database could have been pending at the time the application <lb/>citing them was evaluated since records are continuously updated if legal status changes. The average <lb/>pendency time for examination (time between filing and grant) at the EPO was around 40.6 months in 2005 <lb/>and decreasing with respect to previous years (1.9% with respect to 2004, see OECD 2009). Pending status <lb/>can be associated to several factors: growing complexity and volume of applications, increasing workload <lb/>at the patent office, strategic delay for request of examination (Van Zeebroeck et al., 2009; Harhoff and <lb/>Wagner, 2006). <lb/></body>

Are they <lb/>filed by firms with large or small patent portfolios?

On the size of the patent portfolio of patent applicants, using company data on <lb/>patenting motivations by European companies (EPO Applicant Panel Survey), De Rassenffosse and <lb/>Guellec (2009) consistently find that companies declaring patenting in order to preserve freedom to operate <lb/>(defensive) hold larger patent application portfolios but of lower levels of quality (average family size). In <lb/>addition, in line with this rationale of defence, Lanjouw and Schankermann (2001) provide evidence that a <lb/>larger patent portfolio increases applicants&apos; defence against opposition as it opens new settlement options <lb/>(e.g. licensing). We expect then that business applicants having large patent portfolios would tend to have <lb/>more strategic patents with defensive motivations: these companies would have more experience in <lb/>managing and drafting patent rights, would be more knowledgeable of the surroundings of their <lb/>technological territory (specialisation). <lb/>5.1. <lb/>The model <lb/>Using probit models, we intend to identify the characteristics of inventions by comparing our pre-<lb/>emptive categories with the rest of patents. Our sample corresponds to all applications filed by business <lb/>applicants in the period 1990-2000 and cited up to end 2006 in non-pending applications as of May 2007. <lb/>Recall that for identifying the category of pure-x withdrawn cited applications, we use all forward citations <lb/>accounted until the last year available in our data (2006). Hence filings made in 2000 have at least six <lb/>years to be referenced in the search reports of new patent applications. 26 <lb/>As explanatory variables, we first include under the heading &quot; scope and cost &quot; the number of claims, <lb/>number of IPC classes (at the four-digit level) and the number of inventors (approximating costs of <lb/>inventions), respectively. Second, under the heading &quot; cumulativeness &quot; , we include the number of <lb/>backward patent citations (which indicates cumulativeness of technology) and science linkages (i.e. share <lb/>of non patent literature references in all the backward citations of a patent application), which could <lb/>indicate more basic research, as well as the intensity of self patent references (i.e. share of self patent <lb/>references in all backward patent citations). Further, under the heading &quot; applicant&apos;s portfolio, we include <lb/>two variables regarding patenting activity by business applicants: the portfolio size (number of patent <lb/>applications accumulated by the end of the previous year) and a dummy controlling for &quot; first time &quot; <lb/>patentees. 27 The dummy on &quot; first time &quot; patentees intends to capture the lack of experience in patenting <lb/>which might be associated with a higher rate of abandon (and anticipated rejection). As already mentioned, <lb/>some of the other variables already control for &quot; quality&apos; attributes of inventions (notably number of <lb/>inventors, science linkage, cumulatively, etc.). Finally, we control for the impact of having the first <lb/>applicant residence in the United States, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, <lb/>Switzerland and any other country (the reference category being Canada); and to control for differences <lb/>across technology fields, we rely on the broad technology classes correspondence with IPC classes <lb/>developed by OST-INPI/FhG and look at patent applications filed in electronics, instruments, chemicals-<lb/>materials, pharmaceuticals-biotech, industrial processes, machines-mechanics-transport and construction-<lb/>25 <lb/>For the selection of patent applications filed by business applicants we have relied on data provided by the <lb/>OECD on EP patent applications by type of applicant (institutional affiliation as defined in the Frascati <lb/>Manual) based on the algorithm developed by van Looy et al., (2006) for Eurostat. <lb/>26 <lb/>We have conducted the same probit regressions reported in this section breaking up the period of analysis <lb/>to patents being filed during 1990-1995 and 1996-2000 and the results are quite similar. Results are <lb/>available upon request. <lb/></body>

			<body>consumer products (the latter being the category of reference). As for filing years, we consider the period <lb/>1990-2000 and take 1990 as the year of reference. <lb/>We conduct two probit models to estimate: i) the likelihood of being a Pure-X withdrawn patent <lb/>reference against other references (cited in non-pending applications), and ii) the likelihood of being a <lb/>Pure-X withdrawn patent reference against all other references being withdrawn not categorised as Pure-X. <lb/>Table A2 in Annex 2 provides summary statistics for the samples of analysis. Results of the probit models <lb/>are set out in Table 2. In order to go further into the understanding of pre-emption and characteristics of <lb/>(very) defensive filings, we report regressions for chemicals-materials and biotechnology-pharma. <lb/>5.2. <lb/>Results <lb/>In a first regression (Probit Model 1 in Table 2: Pure-X withdrawn v. other patent references), <lb/>we compare the factors affecting the likelihood of being cited as Pure-X and being withdrawn with respect <lb/>to any other cited patents. Patents being cited as conflicting (to others) and being abandoned have <lb/>significantly less numbers of claims, less numbers of inventors, and they have significantly more patent <lb/>references (in total), a stronger scientific content and a higher self-citation rate than other patent <lb/>applications. This evidence suggests that pre-emptive patent applications may cover &quot; repackaging &quot; <lb/>inventions: inventions which are mainly a remix of existing art (more backward citations, both from the <lb/>patent and non patent literature) done at low cost (less inventors). Fewer inventors in a patent is associated <lb/>in the literature with lower cost patented inventions (Gambardella et al., 2005) whereas a higher number of <lb/>backward patent citations might be indicating a stronger cumulative (or inter-dependence) of the <lb/>technology. The coincidence of low inventiveness and high pre-emptive impact supports the idea that some <lb/>of these patents may be designed defensively by their applicants to strategically block patenting by others. <lb/>Further, the United States and the United Kingdom are more frequently a source of this type of patent <lb/>filings which could reflect either a business strategy or a patent attorney&apos;s strategy. 28 <lb/>The results for pharma-biotech and chemicals-materials (which are the only technological fields in the <lb/>first regression for all technologies with positive and significant marginal effects) differ, between them and <lb/>from those obtained for all technologies, indicating that pre-emptive patenting works differently across <lb/>technology areas. In terms of characteristics of the invention, compared to the regression in the total <lb/>sample, only the number of patent references, and the science linkage matters for both chemicals and <lb/>pharma (there is no association with respect to the scope of the invention in terms of number of claims or <lb/>its complexity in terms of number of inventors). Although the model on the total sample shows no <lb/>association with the size of the patent portfolio of applicants, there is a significant impact in pharma-<lb/>biotech and chemicals-materials (compared to construction–consumer products, 5% and 1% higher <lb/>probability respectively). This might reflect the higher value of individual patents in these fields (and <lb/>notably in pharma-biotech) than in other fields: this higher value justifies the use of (costly) defensive <lb/>patenting strategies for protecting high value patents or preventing competitors obtaining patent protection. <lb/>Pure-X withdrawn are also more likely to be self-references than other types of references in both fields, <lb/>which is probably linked to the result that the likelihood of this type of defensive patents increases with the <lb/>size of the patent portfolio (although the effect is quite small). Hence in these two technology areas, <lb/>business applicants with large patenting portfolios would be more frequently involved in strategic <lb/>patenting of a defensive nature through the use of withdrawals. Specifically in pharma-biotech, and <lb/>28 <lb/>Interestingly, the investigation of the determinants of unused blocking patents (in the sense of aiming at <lb/>blocking competitors) based on PATVAL shows that compared to unused sleeping patents, the probability <lb/>of being in the former group increases for patents whose owner is a company with a United States parent. <lb/>In terms of technology effects, patents aiming at blocking are more likely to be found in chemicals and <lb/>pharmaceuticals (given the conditional probability of &quot; unused &quot; patents; see European Commission, <lb/>Evaluating the knowledge economy, Technical report, 2006). <lb/></body>

			<body>contrary to the average patent and to patents in chemicals-materials, broader patents in terms of IPC are <lb/>more likely to have pre-emptive effects (compared to the rest of patent filings). <lb/>To take account of the fact that among the Pure-X withdrawn there are patents which might not be <lb/>strategic but simply poor quality patents, in a second regression (Probit Model 2 in Table 2: Pure-X <lb/>withdrawn v. other withdrawn patent references) we attempt to isolate the characteristics due to poor <lb/>quality in Pure-X withdrawals from the characteristics that might be more related to pre-emption (strategic <lb/>motivation) by comparing Pure-X withdrawn to other withdrawals (not being cited in this category). The <lb/>results are quite interesting: controlling for the different attributes reflecting quality (for which we expect <lb/>no significant differences between the two groups of patents: there is no significant difference in terms of <lb/>claims nor in science linkage or number of inventors), the Pure-X withdrawn still report a significantly <lb/>lower number of IPC classes, have more scientific content and tend to be filed by firms with larger patent <lb/>portfolios. Thus, they are intrinsically narrower, possibly because they target very specific domains or <lb/>specific rivals, they also build more intensively over existing knowledge codified in non patent literature <lb/>(scientific linkage) and are more likely to come from large patentees than other types of withdrawals. <lb/>Patents with a high science content may raise barriers in forward research as they may be disclosing very <lb/>embryonic or very general research that may block further or parallel developments of technology <lb/>(e.g. given the generality of research, cross-technologies effects of knowledge, or the patenting of <lb/>inventions that serve as instruments of research in different domains, etc.). The fact that the &apos;first patentee&apos; <lb/>effect is not significant in this model (but was in the first probit) shows that first-time patentees tend to <lb/>withdraw due to lack of experience rather than strategic behaviour, as it is associated with all types of <lb/>withdrawals, be they pure X or not. This is consistent with previous studies on the factors affecting the <lb/>probability of withdrawal, which has been found to be higher for small-and medium-sized companies and <lb/>independent inventors, who might more frequently lack experience in drafting patents and estimating the <lb/>economic value of inventions (Iversen and Kaloudis, 2006; Sterlacchini and Schettino, 2008). <lb/>We find important differences in the second regression for all technologies and the individual ones for <lb/>chemicals and pharma-biotech (again, those technological fields with positive and significant marginal <lb/>effects in the second regression for all technologies). In particular, whereas in the main regression the <lb/>number of IPC classes and the portfolio size of the applicant had significant marginal effects (negative for <lb/>IPC classes and positive for the portfolio size), both of them lose significance in the individual technology <lb/>regressions. On the other hand, the positive and significant effect of science linkage is only present in <lb/>pharma, whereas the positive and significant effect of self-patent references intensity only appears in <lb/>pharma-biotech. The only significant characteristics distinguishing pure-X withdrawals from the rest of <lb/>abandoned patent filings in the field of chemicals-materials are, first, that they have significantly less <lb/>patent references and, second, that these are more likely to be self-references. In turn, the distinctive trait <lb/>between pure-x withdrawals and other withdrawn references in pharma-biotechnology is that they have <lb/>significantly more references, both from patent and non-patent literature (a sign of an incremental and <lb/>generic nature) and that they are less likely to be filed by first time patentees. The latter could be <lb/>considered as another indication of their strategic nature as one would expect defensive strategies of this <lb/>kind to be used by more experienced patentees. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>There are several ways to improve this analysis. Controlling for the date of withdrawal and national <lb/>validations should provide useful additional insight, however information on validations of EPO-granted <lb/>patents in all EPC member states was not yet available in PATSTAT at the time of writing. Neither was <lb/>information on dates of withdrawals for EPO applications. However, one should pay attention to the fact <lb/>that seeking patent protection can go through different administrative routes (national, international, etc). <lb/>In addition, it is obvious that an early withdrawal at EPO reduces, by definition, the possibility of <lb/>extending the patent in other countries. Care should be taken in considering the status of patents which <lb/>have initially been granted by national offices and that have proceeded to a second stage for regional <lb/>protection (obviously those patents might be less likely to be defensive). <lb/>Our group of Pure-X withdrawals includes a very small share of patents that were granted and later <lb/>withdrawn (5%). Those few patent filings may refer to applications that were deemed to be exploited and <lb/>were eventually found unworkable economically and/or were intended to &quot; offense &quot; other patents (having a <lb/>grant could leverage opportunities for cross-licensing and is required for litigation). Hence, given that <lb/>applications of this type are few in our sample there is a weak indication that the patent filings identified as <lb/> &quot; very pre-emptive &quot; intended to finalise the patent process and their association to very &quot; defensive &quot; <lb/>purposes is thus appropriate. <lb/>6. <lb/>CONCLUSION <lb/>There is compelling survey evidence that some firms use patents to prevent competitors from <lb/>patenting. Pre-emptive patenting has a double benefit. By creating prior art and raising uncertainty, it <lb/>prevents the grant of market exclusivity rights to others while providing freedom of operation to its <lb/>applicant. For these purposes the publication of a filing can suffice. There is however limited empirical <lb/>evidence on how this phenomenon works. This paper provides evidence on pre-empting patenting using a <lb/>statistical approach at the patent level to address such questions. <lb/>Our findings show that pre-emption of patenting by others can occur by filing patents with a minor <lb/>technical contribution to the art. The filing of patent applications containing trivial inventions to create <lb/>prior art contributes to raising uncertainty and the patentability threshold for competing inventions. <lb/>Furthermore, our investigation shows that companies file patents to pre-empt competitors from obtaining <lb/>patent protection in specific technologies or markets without necessarily aiming at getting protection <lb/>themselves. This novel finding, namely the investigation of the role of withdrawals as pre-emptive <lb/>instruments, sheds further light on the complex uses of patents for strategic purposes. Hence this <lb/>investigation helps broaden the analysis of patents as strategic instruments and provides empirical <lb/>statistical evidence compatible with the pre-empting patenting view stressed in the literature. Consistent <lb/>with some studies, our findings shows that these withdrawn patent filings are often not very inventive <lb/>(i.e. lower number of inventors) and may be repackaging existing art at low cost (i.e. more patent and <lb/>non-patent literature cited in their search reports). Hence the coincidence of low technical quality and high <lb/>pre-emptive power supports the idea that some of these applications are designed specifically by their <lb/>applicants to block strategically competitors. This evidence confirms that, as instruments for defence, <lb/>pre-emptive patents contribute to expand the flood of patenting. <lb/>There are positive and negative sides to pre-emptive patent filings. Patents can be viewed as a social <lb/>contract between the patent owner and society, where the price to be paid by the patentee in return for <lb/>exclusivity is the disclosure of the invention. In the cases we have analysed in this paper, however, <lb/>applicants see the disclosure of inventions through the patent system not as a cost, but as a benefit. <lb/>Preventing others from patenting with patent filings that are later withdrawn can result in a patent-free area <lb/>and possibly an effective means to &quot; cut through the patent thicket &quot; in some fields. Hence defensive patents <lb/>can be very valuable instruments as they allow a patent holder to preserve market exclusion and <lb/>exploitation of his actual patented technology. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>Yet pre-emptive patenting has a direct impact on the working of the patent system. Pre-empting <lb/>filings contribute to a kind of arms race and feed patent inflation. Some activity in defensive patenting <lb/>constitutes an answer to potential offensive patenting. Increasing the backlog of patent offices with filings <lb/>of dubious technical quality to prevent the grant of other patent applications is nevertheless far from being <lb/>an efficient way to improve the functioning of the patent system. For patent offices, handling examination <lb/>periods and reducing pendency of applications under examination is becoming a critical issue. Our results <lb/>draw attention to pending applications which are influencing examination of others and are abandoned by <lb/>their applicant. Proposals have been made regarding the implementation of a purifying mechanism for <lb/>filings, like the proposition of increasing application fees which could be reimbursed after grant; or the <lb/>imposition of penalties or rejection of very complex filings (confusing draft of claims). <lb/>Lastly, our results call for further research on the effects of pre-emptive patents on firms and markets. <lb/>First, their effects on R&amp;D investments by companies and innovation are not clear: how do companies <lb/>react to the foreclosure of entry into patenting? Does their technological trajectory change by re-directing <lb/>R&amp;D to other fields? Are pre-empting companies innovating more? Second, what are the results in product <lb/>markets? These are our next lines of investigation. <lb/>DSTI/DOC(2009)8 <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX 1: INFORMATION FROM PATENT REFERENCES <lb/>Patent examiners classify relevant prior art in order to characterise the novelty and inventive step of <lb/>the claimed invention. This categorisation is our point of reference to identify and evaluate the pre-emptive <lb/>power of patent references. Citation categories X, Y and E apply to prior patent filings compromising the <lb/>novelty and patentability of new applications, whereas citation category A corresponds to patent references <lb/>that are relevant to the state of the art (see Table 1). The system of citation categories is generally only <lb/>used by the EPO and by PCT international search authorities (ISA). <lb/>29 Other large patent offices, such as <lb/>the USPTO, use it in their international preliminary search reports when they act as ISA, but not for their <lb/>internal examination procedures. <lb/>Table A1. Citation categories in EPO and PCT search reports <lb/>Category <lb/>Meaning <lb/>X <lb/>Particularly relevant documents when taken alone (a claimed invention cannot be considered <lb/>novel or cannot be considered to involve an inventive step) <lb/>Y <lb/>Particularly relevant documents if combined with one or more other documents of the same <lb/>category such a combination being obvious to a person skilled in the art <lb/>E <lb/>Potentially conflicting documents – any patent document bearing a filing or priority date earlier <lb/>than the filing date of the application searched but published later than that date, and the content <lb/>of which would constitute prior art <lb/>A <lb/>Documents defining the general state of the art (but not belonging to X or Y) <lb/>Source: European Patent Office, Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (2007). <lb/>Patent references cited under the X citation category would be the most important ones to invalidate <lb/>the novelty or inventiveness of one or more claims within a patent application. If the search report of an <lb/>application includes a patent reference categorised as X associated to a particular claim or claims, it means <lb/>that the application does not meet the requirements of novelty or inventive step with respect to that claim <lb/>or claims. After receiving the search report, the applicant could withdraw the application in view of an <lb/>anticipated refusal, or revise those claims in an attempt to obtain patent protection for other parts of the <lb/>invention, or proceed with the application without changing anything, hoping to get a grant regardless of <lb/>the unfavourable prior art search report. Type E references are equivalent to type X references, the only <lb/>difference between them is a question of time, with E references referring to patent filings which have been <lb/>published after the filing of the application for which the prior art search report is being undertaken. Type <lb/>Y patent references, when taken together or in conjunction with other references, may have the same <lb/>29 <lb/>The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides the possibility to seek patent rights in a large <lb/>number of countries (contracting states of the treaty) by filing a single international application (PCT <lb/>application) with a single patent office (receiving office). PCT applications do not result in the issuance of <lb/> &quot; international patents &quot; . The decision on whether to grant or reject patent rights rests with national or <lb/>regional patent offices. PCT applications are administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization <lb/>(WIPO). <lb/></body>

			<body>effect, but less directly so. 30 In turn, type A references merely provide technical background information. <lb/>See Annex 1 for more details about the definition of our sample of EP patent filings. <lb/>We have restricted our analysis to patents with search reports prepared by EPO examiners (for EPO <lb/>direct and PCT filings at EPO) to ensure homogeneity of criteria for identifying conflicting citations. <lb/>31 In <lb/>order to have information on the procedural status of the cited application, we have replaced non-EP patent <lb/>citations by their EP-equivalents (if they do not have an EP-equivalent, they are excluded) and limited our <lb/>econometric study to EP to EP citations and to EP to non-EP citations whenever the non-EP application <lb/>cited had an EP equivalent. In the latter case we considered the citation category assigned to the non-EP <lb/>application cited originally, but considered the procedural status and main IPC class of its equivalent filing <lb/>at EPO. We combined, avoiding duplications, EPO citations (X, Y, E or A) from EPO and PCT search <lb/>reports for completeness. The EPO-direct and PCT search reports of each patent application tend to be <lb/>done by the same examiner at EPO who then does not usually compile all references in a single document, <lb/>so that a full list of references is best obtained by combining citations from the PCT and EPO reports (see <lb/>Webb et al., 2005). <lb/>30 <lb/>The decision to grant or reject a patent application is taken on the basis of the references given to prior art <lb/>reflecting not &quot; the complete profile of prior art &quot; but &quot; the closest and most relevant prior art &quot; (see EPO <lb/>guidelines for examiners): One X or two Y are enough to invalidate at least one claim, possibly more. <lb/>31 <lb/>As said earlier, other patent offices use citation categories to prepare international preliminary search <lb/>reports when acting as ISA (International Search Authority), but not for their internal examination <lb/>processes, so EPO search reports are the only ones permitting this kind of analysis. It remains a task for <lb/>further research to estimate and quantify the pre-emptive activity associated to non-EP patents. At the EPO, <lb/>referencing seeks to use the earliest and most easily available &quot; incarnation &quot; of an invention, preferably in <lb/>the language of the applicant (see OECD, 2009). However, a patent (application or grant) can be cited as a <lb/>national publication or international/regional, or as one of its equivalents (in a patent family; e.g. a filing <lb/>with same priority at the EPO, USPTO, JPO). <lb/></body>
