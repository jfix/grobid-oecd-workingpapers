			<body>INTERACTION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STANDARDS IN THE FOOD CHAIN <lb/>Summary and conclusions <lb/>This paper discusses a number of issues arising from the contiguous development of public and <lb/>private quality standards, predominately in developed countries. The paper is an exploratory examination <lb/>of the ways in which public and private food quality standards interact with each other in modern food <lb/>systems. This review is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of the subject matter which is a <lb/>relatively new area of research. The focus of the report is on food quality standards which are defined here <lb/>as including the full array of food product and process attributes required by consumers and society as well <lb/>as food safety. Food safety is clearly an integral part of food quality at least to the extent that food safety is <lb/>a basic prerequisite for any quality attribute. However, food safety has very different requirements than <lb/>other food quality attributes. Food safety is essentially a &quot; public good &quot; because safe food is a basic <lb/>requirement of any food system to ensure trust in the food supply. It is traditionally seen as a sovereign <lb/>responsibility of the government to provide regulations, usually compulsory food safety standards as a <lb/>basis for guaranteeing that food on offer is safe when delivered to consumers. Due to the presence of <lb/>externalities, informational asymmetries and public goods characteristics, markets alone will generally not <lb/>provide the socially desirable amount of food safety. Hence it is assumed here that the competence for food <lb/>safety standards remains a public sector responsibility and outside the ambit of the discussion in the paper <lb/>concerning the interaction of public and private food quality standards. <lb/>The report is based on a review of the literature, from which it becomes evident that research on the <lb/>relations and inter-linkages between public and private standards in national food quality systems and <lb/>international trade is still very much in its infancy. However, it is clearly apparent that systems of food <lb/>quality control are evolving with increasingly complex interaction between public and private modes of <lb/>food quality regulation. Government oversight of food quality has increased substantially in many <lb/>countries over the last decade including the introduction of more stringent ex ante direct regulations and <lb/>ex post indirect controls. In addition, private protocols and mechanisms have developed rapidly and now <lb/>play an increasingly important role in the supply of higher quality food. The result is an increasingly <lb/>complex network of both public and private standards to assure the increasing quality of products on offer <lb/>in agricultural and food markets. <lb/>At the same time, public food standards are being subject to closer scrutiny in the WTO and <lb/>elsewhere in terms of their scientific justification and economic efficiency, which, in turn, is influencing <lb/>the course of the progression. Historically, the public sector was involved with setting standards for <lb/>product grades, weights and measures used in arms length transactions for mass markets composed of <lb/>largely homogenous agricultural commodities. Grades and standards in these markets have many of the <lb/>characteristics of public goods and will remain predominately in the public domain. Public food quality <lb/>regulations are, in general, becoming more performance and process based, placing greater responsibility <lb/>on private food companies to implement effective food quality controls. In turn, private food quality <lb/>standards have emerged to mitigate regulatory and reputational risks faced by private food businesses, and <lb/>are increasingly being employed to facilitate competitive positioning in higher value food markets, through <lb/>product differentiation based on an increasing array of food quality attributes. <lb/></body>

			<body>As advances in science, increases in wealth and evolving societal concerns with respect to the <lb/>environment, sustainability and animal welfare put greater focus on a wider range of food quality <lb/>attributes, both private firms and public institutions find themselves responding increasingly to consumer <lb/>and societal demands for higher food quality. However, private and social interests are often distinct and <lb/>an efficient food quality control system operated from a private business perspective may not yield socially <lb/>efficient outcomes. Firms have incentives to provide high quality food in order to gain competitive <lb/>advantage, but in cases where information available to consumers on which to judge food quality is <lb/>imperfect, market and legal incentives may be insufficient to give consumers the level of quality and <lb/>protection that society as a whole would like. In such cases of information asymmetries and externalities, <lb/>governments continue to play an important role in correcting market failures by enacting minimum food <lb/>quality regulations. In the case of experience and credence goods, consumers rely to a large extent on <lb/>public standards and quality signalling to ensure the quality of food products provided in the market. This <lb/>reflects both the difficulty they face to evaluate food product quality in such instances or to take recourse <lb/>against suppliers if the product turns out not to meet their expectations. However, this does not necessarily <lb/>imply that mandatory regulations or quality standards are required in all circumstances. Governments may <lb/>instead introduce voluntary standards and seek compliance with such quality standards. For a voluntary <lb/>standards approach to be successful, the government must be prepared to follow up by imposing <lb/>mandatory standards if adequate food quality compliance is not achieved with voluntary standards. But <lb/>where practices by producers can have serious effects on the well-being of consumers, governments often <lb/>decide to take preventive action to rule out such possibilities. In these incidences, the government will <lb/>choose mandatory standards. <lb/>In circumstances where adequate information is available to consumers or can be found by them on <lb/>the quality attributes of a food product, the role of mandatory standards is more questionable. For search <lb/>attributes of food quality, the market will normally provide efficient incentives for producers to provide <lb/>food quality even in the absence of mandatory standards or a well-functioning product liability system. <lb/>Despite the economic arguments in favour of voluntary controls, it is noteworthy that traditional mandatory <lb/>regulatory systems still tend to predominate in many national and regional food regulatory systems, <lb/>compared to incentive based voluntary instruments of control. <lb/>Producer and consumer interests may also differ in the domain of international trade. While domestic <lb/>agricultural and food producers have an interest to set standards so as to provide them with a competitive <lb/>advantage over imports, this is not necessarily in the interest of consumers. This argument may be less <lb/>valid in the case of globally operating food retailers and food service firms. With the creation of the WTO <lb/>and Sanitary and Photo Sanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreements establishing <lb/>clear rules on the applications of standards by member countries to minimise any negative trade effects, <lb/>governments now face increased scrutiny to ensure that standards are not introduced for the purpose of <lb/>trade protection. The initial results in terms of disputes brought to the WTO would suggest that the WTO <lb/>processes, particularly in relation to SPS matters, are having some degree of success in reducing trade <lb/>protection resulting from the imposition of public standards. <lb/>Private voluntary standards can also affect trade. In a world where private standards predominate in <lb/>global supply chains controlled by multinational food companies, a key issue for a food exporter or <lb/>supplier is to gain access to the global value chain. With a diminishing number of leading retailers and <lb/>global food businesses due to industry consolidation and concentration trends, there is greater scope for <lb/>exclusion from entire markets if private standards laying down conditions of entry are not met. By the <lb/>same token, for those exporters who do gain access to these global value chains, the benefits in terms of <lb/>trade relations can be substantial. Standards can thus have a catalytic effect in opening up trade <lb/>opportunities for such exporters. However, the evolution of private standards does not imply that public <lb/>regulatory standards will disappear. Exporters will still need to demonstrate compliance with public <lb/>standards to gain entry to national markets. What it does suggest, however, is that there will likely be <lb/></body>

			<body>economic gains from closer co-ordination of public and private standards and related control systems. An <lb/>example is provided by dairy industries in EU member states which have reached common agreement to <lb/>harmonised standards on quality of dairy products across member states and then EU wide standards are <lb/>set by the European Commission. Another example at the regional level of the benefits of such <lb/>coordination is provided by the Rapid Alert System in the EU that was established in cooperation with <lb/>private industry food retailers and distributors to rapidly remove products from retailer shelves if quality <lb/>problems are detected. <lb/>With the increasing globalisation of food supply chains, both systems are being influenced by trade <lb/>agreements in the WTO and by the work of international food quality standardisation organisations. While <lb/>this is leading to increased transparency of public regulatory processes, one concern is that a similar level <lb/>of transparency may not apply to private standards and their associated control and enforcement processes. <lb/>The mix between public and private food quality standards continues to evolve. There appears to be <lb/>some movement towards a separation of standards and food regulation in developed countries, with the <lb/>former the domain of private firms and the later that of public agencies. Direct regulation is placing more <lb/>emphasis on company level responsibility. Private standards and market forces related to market <lb/>segmentation and higher returns to a firm&apos;s reputation tend to reinforce this development. The shift of <lb/>responsibilities towards the private sector has created a more complex policy space involving public and <lb/>private sector incentives and controls. In this situation, public regulatory agencies need to be more aware <lb/>of their actions in the context of evolving private modes of food quality management as the way in which <lb/>public standards are developed can act to augment market-based incentives to invest in enhanced food <lb/>quality and supply chain controls. <lb/>From this brief review of the literature it would appear that while private food quality standards are <lb/>often higher, more flexible and agile in responding to a wide range of continually evolving consumer <lb/>preferences for food quality than public quality standards enforced by single nations on their domestic food <lb/>supply or as a result of international negotiations (Codex); overall, public and private food quality <lb/>standards tend to be complementary. In many cases private standards build on the existing public standard <lb/>infrastructure to provide an element of competition through quality differentiation. Public standards are <lb/>still necessary to correct market failures associated with information asymmetries or consumption <lb/>externalities and where standards have clearly public good characteristics. Public standards will, therefore, <lb/>continue to play a dominant role in establishing basic grades and standards for mass markets composed of <lb/>largely homogenous agricultural products to create economies of scale and for ensuring minimum <lb/>standards of a safe food supply as well as to prevent fraud or quality deception of consumers. They also <lb/>have a global role in assuring that basic standards are consistent across countries and with those that are <lb/>required to be met (SPS, TBT) in cross border trade. Private standards may play a substitute role in <lb/>situations where there is an absence of effective public standards to provide a measure of food quality for <lb/>consumers. Alternatively, private standards have emerged despite the existence of strong public food <lb/>quality standards as a means to differentiate products, reflecting the growing role of quality as the mode of <lb/>competition in agricultural and food markets, as well as to facilitate effective coordination of expansive <lb/>buyer supply chains. In certain circumstances, private standards can also act to facilitate compliance with <lb/>public standards to allow for better targeting of scarce compliance resources. In markets for differentiated <lb/>products and to meet requirements of niche markets (including for product liability), food companies may <lb/>choose to exceed public standards with higher private standards. In this way, private and public standards <lb/>can be mutually reinforcing, contributing to total system efficacy and resulting in higher quality food being <lb/>available in national and global markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>A. <lb/>Introduction <lb/>Contemporary agri-food systems are increasingly pervaded by an array of inter-related public and <lb/>private standards. These are becoming a mandatory part of doing business in supply chains for processed <lb/>food products, beyond basic bulk commodities [Henson and Reardon, 2005]. Governments have <lb/>traditionally played the major role in establishing minimum food quality standards and regulations for their <lb/>populations. This recognises a degree of government responsibility for food quality issues to ensure, <lb/>amongst other things, the availability of safe food 1 for the population at large and to protect consumers <lb/>from deceptive and fraudulent practices <lb/>Standards continue to evolve in response to changes in technology, scientific developments regarding <lb/>the risks associated with food and directly in response to consumer and societal demands. They have <lb/>proliferated and diversified their coverage over time as societal activities have become more complex. At <lb/>the same time, structural and institutional evolutions based on private control systems and enforcement <lb/>procedures are taking place in the agri-food sector of many developed countries in conjunction with trends <lb/>in consumer demand that have increased the role of private voluntary standards in food chains. The wider <lb/>use of private standards is refocusing agricultural and food supply chains from price-based to quality-based <lb/>centres of competition [Henson and Reardon, 2005]. Quality food standards are now increasingly seen as <lb/>private goods that differentiate food products and are increasingly in the domain of private firms. Public <lb/>standards and regulatory controls have also evolved over time in most countries around the world, and <lb/>have become ever more stringent and complex as consumers demand specific attributes or disclosure of <lb/>information about certain attributes of food [Josling et al., 2004]. <lb/>Increasingly, supply chains for food products are extending beyond national borders, facilitated in part <lb/>by new processed food products and a policy environment more supportive of international food trade. <lb/>Minimum quality standards while protecting the consumer often do not allow food retail businesses, food <lb/>service companies and processing firms in a contemporary food system to differentiate their products <lb/>based on quality attributes to protect and gain market share when competing in national and regional <lb/>markets 2 . As a consequence, private standards have emerged to fill this gap and to respond to regulatory <lb/>developments. In general, these are based on coordinated systems for meeting consumer demand for <lb/>quality attributes based on product differentiation and market segmentation [Fulponi, 2006]. As private <lb/>food companies and retail businesses expand across the world and develop local and global supply chains, <lb/>they set standards for the quality of foods they will purchase from suppliers and sell to consumers. These <lb/>standards may be higher and more demanding than the minimum standards enforced by governments in <lb/>their national markets. However, private standards as a fairly recent phenomenon are not yet universally <lb/>applied with public standards still the dominant form of control in the food systems of some countries. <lb/>Given these developments, many questions arise as to the relationship between public and private <lb/>standards in the modern food system. With the growing importance of private voluntary standards that are <lb/>often set at higher levels, more frequently adjusted and applied to more varied areas than government <lb/>1 <lb/>Food safety is clearly an integral part of food quality at least to the extent that food safety is a basic prerequisite for <lb/>any quality attribute. However, food safety has very different requirements than other food quality attributes. Food <lb/>safety is essentially a &quot; public good &quot; because safe food is a basic requirement of any food system to ensure trust in the <lb/>food supply. It is traditionally seen as a sovereign responsibility of the government to provide regulations, <lb/>usually compulsory food safety standards as a basis for guaranteeing that food on offer is safe when delivered to <lb/>consumers. Due to the presence of externalities, informational asymmetries and public goods characteristics, markets <lb/>alone will generally not provide the socially desirable amount of food safety. Hence it is assumed here that the <lb/>competence for food safety standards remains a public sector responsibility and outside the ambit of the discussion in <lb/>the paper concerning the interaction of public and private food quality standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>standards, the question that arises is what is the role of government standards and food regulations? Can <lb/>decisions on standards by individual private firms be relied on to yield outcomes that coincide with broader <lb/>public policy goals? A related question is whether existing standard setting arrangements are conducive to <lb/>aligning public and private outcomes? Are public standards still required and for what purposes? Would <lb/>private quality standards be lower in the absence of minimum public food quality standards? <lb/>This report aims to throw light on such questions at the interface between public and private food <lb/>standards in modern food chains through a selective review of the extensive literature that is available. The <lb/>focus is on the role played by public and private standards in contemporary food systems, their evolving <lb/>relations and how they interact with each other (i.e. complement, substitute, conflict or convergent) in <lb/>establishing incentives for food suppliers to provide high quality food in national and international food <lb/>markets. <lb/>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the economic concepts of relevance to standards <lb/>as a lead in to the types and definitions of food standards in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the rationale for <lb/>government food regulations or public standards. The factors explaining the emergence and growing <lb/>prominence of private voluntary standards are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 extends the discussion of <lb/>standards to take in the international trade dimension. A final section attempts to draw the threads of the <lb/>discussion together on the different roles and interactions between public and private standards in national <lb/>and global food systems. <lb/>B. <lb/>The economics of food quality standards <lb/>The economic literature on standards as initially conceived identified the provision of information and <lb/>compatibility, or the network externalities approach, as being the driving force for standardisation [Katz <lb/>and Shapiro, 1985]. Economic gains accrue due to positive network effects which arise when the value of a <lb/>good to a user increases the more other users adopt the same good or compatible ones [Becker, 1999]. <lb/>Classic examples of positive network externalities are telephones and fax machines, whose value to an <lb/>individual user increases with the number of users connected to the service. Much of the focus of the <lb/>economic literature in the area of food standards has been on the role of public food quality standards both <lb/>as policy instruments for regulating food markets and as potential non-tariff measures, although more <lb/>attention is now being given to the growing role of private food quality standards in the food supply chain <lb/>[Henson, 2006]. <lb/>In this section the economics of standards is discussed in the context of food quality. Food quality <lb/>standards have been selected for several reasons. Firstly, with rising incomes and higher standards of <lb/>living, consumers generally have become more demanding and fragmented in their food choices. Private <lb/>food standards have emerged in part to respond to this need, with a shift to quality competition based on <lb/>product differentiation in terms of quality of food products and away from price-based competition among <lb/>firms. Secondly, agri-food products are characterised by considerable variability and heterogeneity that <lb/>create uncertainty for consumers on the different attributes that make up food product quality. As food <lb/>quality depends crucially on objective characteristics of products as well as individual subjective <lb/>preferences, quality per se is difficult to define. 3 Two different analytical conceptions are used in the <lb/>literature on food quality. 4 The consumer behaviour literature favours the consumer perceived quality or <lb/>3 <lb/>The International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) has developed a definition of food quality that has been widely <lb/>used. Quality is defined as the &quot; totality of features and characteristics of a product that bear on its ability to satisfy <lb/>stated or implied needs &quot; However, this definition is so general it is not useful for analytical purposes <lb/>4 <lb/>The two analytical approaches are potentially contradictory as is evident in the case of the beef hormones issue <lb/>between the US and EU. While the European Union is in favour of the perceived quality approach, the US takes the <lb/>view that no scientific evidence is available to confirm (EU) consumer perceptions that hormone treated beef is of <lb/>inferior quality and hence no justification for an EU ban on such imports which is in violation of the WTO rules. <lb/></body>

			<body>attribute approach, while the food science literature emphasises the measurable quality approach based on <lb/>objective product quality [Bowbrick, 1992]. In the case of the former approach, product quality, in <lb/>following Lancaster [1966], is seen as a bundle of attributes or characteristics or properties that determine a <lb/>products performance. Major categories of food product quality attributes include food nutrition, organo-<lb/>leptic characteristics (colour/appearance, taste, texture, odour and other sensory characteristics, etc.) and <lb/>process attributes covering such things as organic production, dolphin-safe, animal welfare conditions, <lb/>GMO-free, environment preservation and worker conditions [Brunsø et al., 2002]. <lb/>Consumers are assumed to use cues and signals to detect attributes they wish to consume [Becker, <lb/>1999]. A distinction is usually made between intrinsic and extrinsic cues. The former refers to the physical <lb/>properties of the food product and extrinsic cues refer basically to everything else [Grunert, 2005]. Intrinsic <lb/>cues such as colour, appearance, size and smell, are used to predict attributes such as eating quality and <lb/>taste. Among the range of extrinsic cues, three have received special attention in the literature as possible <lb/>quality indicators or signals to consumers. These include product brands, indicators related to a product&apos;s <lb/>origin and quality labels. In the normal course of events, consumers choose foods within the context of a <lb/>total diet in order to obtain greater expected utility from their food. Consumers with different risk <lb/>preferences choose different bundles of foods. If their expectations of the quality attributes of foods (such <lb/>as risks or health hazards associated with certain food products) are not satisfied, consumers suffer a loss <lb/>of utility. On the supply side, food producers will supply food quality if it is profitable for them to do so, or <lb/>if they are required to do so. The higher profitability may arise from increased product differentiation and <lb/>sales to niche markets or from avoidance of losses with costly procedures and associated financial liability <lb/>in the event that quality is not maintained. The market outcome for quality is thus determined in the usual <lb/>way by the supply of characteristics and the demand for attributes and the information that consumers have <lb/>on these attributes [Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]. <lb/>In general, the market for food quality can be characterised by a rising supply (marginal cost) curve <lb/>and a declining demand (marginal benefit) curve [Henson and Traill, 1993; Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]. <lb/>Under perfect market conditions, these schedules intersect at a particular market clearing price providing <lb/>the optimum level of food quality. This scenario assumes that all market participants are fully informed <lb/>about the nature of the product on offer, buyers and sellers are essentially price-takers and that market <lb/>prices reflect all the costs and benefits to society. In such a situation, market prices will transmit all <lb/>necessary information, externalities will not arise and government regulation is not required [Caswell and <lb/>Mojduszka, 1996]. In these circumstances, a variety of products of different qualities will be offered for <lb/>sale in the market at different prices. However, the market for food quality is often far from perfect. The <lb/>more important imperfections arise from asymmetry in information with sellers usually being better <lb/>informed about quality than buyers. In addition, since it is often difficult if not impossible for buyers to tell <lb/>the difference between good and bad (credence) quality products prior to purchase, this situation provides <lb/>incentives for sellers to promise high quality products but to sell low quality products in their place, <lb/>leading to adverse selection as pointed out by Akerlof [1970]. Consumers may also have misconceptions <lb/>about the risks associated with consuming certain foods (externalities) and information about food quality <lb/>may have public good characteristics. In this situation, food quality may be under or over-supplied <lb/>[Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 1. Minimum Quality Standards <lb/>In an overall market context, the economic role of information provides the basic element for understanding the <lb/>importance of standards in the food system. Standards can, in general, improve consumer&apos;s information about product <lb/>quality. As a result, confidence rises and there is an overall increase in demand. Minimum standards may be used in <lb/>situations of imperfect information. In the literature, the theoretical discussion considers &apos;minimum quality standards&apos; <lb/>(MQS) as a minimum that can be applied to any attribute, but the economic reasoning remains the same. <lb/>With imperfect information, regulatory agencies may set minimum quality standards (MQS). Most often MQS are <lb/>used to increase the qualities of goods produced and consumed, though there remains debate on their final effects. <lb/>When governments set MQS this is usually done for consumption externality reasons where free market qualities may <lb/>be considered insufficient. When governments implement minimum quality standards for some products or process <lb/>characteristic, this reduces the quality difference between firms (as nothing less than the minimum quality is allowed to <lb/>be sold) and increases price competition. In this situation, competing firms may decide to increase their quality <lb/>standard of a given attribute in order to relax price competition. But differences in quality between firms are never fully <lb/>restored to levels that existed prior to government standard setting, so prices fall or increase less and welfare rises <lb/>[Ronnen, 1991; Gal-Or, 1997)]. <lb/>1 Authors such as Leland, [1979], Shapiro, [1983], argue that regulatory MQS are not <lb/>sufficient to raise the consumption quality of consumers, since many already consume above the minimum standard <lb/>and other consumers might be driven out of the market as prices rise. <lb/>In the food sector there has been widespread use of minimum quality standards on products and processes <lb/>related to consumption attributes, such as organic or free range. <lb/>2 In order to build and maintain reputation as high <lb/>quality sellers, or to keep customer loyalty and to earn premiums, sellers may decide to set quality levels above MQS. <lb/>Some suggest that this behaviour is a response to consumer demands for higher quality by those willing to pay for it <lb/>[Lutz et al, 2000; Ecchia and Lambertini, 1997; Boom, 1995; Crampes and Hollander 1995]. This may also explain why <lb/>specific high quality product lines in food retailing are set up, such as Tesco&apos;s Nature&apos;s choice, Carrefour&apos;s Fillière de <lb/>Qualité or Loblaw&apos;s President&apos;s choice. An increase in private standards above MQS raises the question of the <lb/>economic or strategic motivation of firms. Is it a new way to compete, a way to insure against possible quality failures, <lb/>a strategy to pre-empt government regulations or simply to influence the regulatory outcomes? <lb/>One strategy is to pre-empt public regulations. Individual firms or a group of firms may decide to exceed existing <lb/>standards if, in doing so, they can influence future regulations. The timing of government and firm decisions is again <lb/>important [Lutz et al, 2000]. If firms decide to adopt a standard above current and expected minimum levels before <lb/>government takes action, then regulators may be influenced to set lower MSQ than they would have done otherwise. <lb/>Under this formulation, food companies may have undertaken substantial investments in machinery and equipment or <lb/>other supply logistics to ensure their specific private standard is achieved and adopted. Governments may be unwilling <lb/>to increase costs to firms with adverse consequences for prices or employment levels, if they set different minimum <lb/>standards. Such a pre-emptive strategy may, however, reduce social welfare compared to a situation where the <lb/>government would have moved first. [Lutz et al, 2000]. This situation can arise where MQS hitherto did not exist. In the <lb/>food sector this could possibly be the case for process attributes such as animal friendly and environmentally friendly <lb/>production processes. In certain cases, firms may over-comply or exceed required standards in order to further <lb/>enhance their reputation for offering high quality products in niche markets. Since over compliance may increase <lb/>reputation and market returns, public knowledge of a firm&apos;s behavior provide incentives to over-comply [Lutz et al, <lb/>2002; Boom, 1995]. <lb/>1. These results are obtained in imperfectly competitive markets where sellers can set prices rather than act in the price taker <lb/>situation discussed in Leland and Shapiro. Ronnen finds that competition in qualities relaxes price competition: To alleviate the effects <lb/>of the more intense price competition on their revenues, sellers of high quality products raise their quality in response to the sellers of <lb/>low quality products that have been forced to raise their quality to the mandated minimum quality level. Consequently, if variable costs <lb/>do not rise &apos;too quickly&apos; with quality, prices corrected for quality fall [Ronnen, 1991 p. 503]. <lb/>2. When minimum standards are set exogenously, they may not be optimal. The optimal standard is found by balancing the benefits <lb/>accruing to consumers of high quality and losses to those who would purchase a good at a quality below the minimum. Regulatory <lb/>agencies set minimum standards for goods where inferior qualities might have negative impacts on society <lb/>Economists have frequently classified goods into three categories that signal the degree of information <lb/>available to consumers when buying them. The first category is search goods. For search goods or <lb/>attributes, consumers are able to ascertain visually a product&apos;s attributes before they purchase and consume <lb/>it by inspecting or researching the product. There is no quality uncertainty given careful pre-purchase <lb/>inspection and assuming that the cost of search is negligible. This is a full information situation. In the case <lb/></body>

			<body>of experience goods or attributes, consumers are only able to determine a product&apos;s quality after they <lb/>purchase and consume it. Allowing for repeated purchases, the experience attribute can be used to <lb/>eliminate any quality uncertainty that may exist in the minds of consumers.[Nelson, 1970] Credence <lb/>attributes denote those quality features of a product which are important to the consumer but which are <lb/>unable to be determined even after consumption [Darby and Karni, 1973; Andersen and Philipsen, 1998]. <lb/>In practice, a single food product could embody attributes that fit all three types of goods. For example, in <lb/>selecting a tomato in a fruit and vegetable stall, one could &quot; search &quot; for a tomato that looks ripe, smells <lb/>good and is free of any external disease or insect infestation. Once the tomato is eaten, the consumer <lb/> &quot; experiences &quot; the quality judging it by a variety of subjective factors, such as flavour, firmness and texture. <lb/>However, the consumer is unable to detect any credence attributes of the tomato. These may relate to the <lb/>method of production such as organic or whether it contains toxic elements or residues that may have a <lb/>long term cumulative effect on the health of the consumer. The consumer essentially &quot; trusts &quot; that these <lb/>credence attributes are either present or absent, as the case maybe, in the tomato that was consumed. <lb/>Credence attributes have the potential to be particularly problematic as the consumer has no way of <lb/>identifying their existence through either pre-purchase search (other than at a prohibitive cost) or from post <lb/>consumption experience. <lb/>Markets for search attributes usually function with simple transactions such as barter exchange or <lb/>open street markets. As full information is available to consumers, these markets can effectively deliver <lb/>search goods with little or no direct government intervention. On the other hand, markets for experience or <lb/>credence goods do not function without some external trust element. For experience attributes, <lb/>information is the most important issue; it determines what consumers can learn about product quality. In <lb/>these markets, producers tend to possess superior information to consumers on the quality of the products <lb/>on offer. In these circumstances, there is a danger of firms taking advantage of their knowledge concerning <lb/>product characteristics and selling low quality products at a price meant for higher quality ones that cost <lb/>more to produce. The risk they face in doing so, however, is a consumer backlash and loss of revenue as <lb/>consumers shop elsewhere in the future for their repeat purchases. Markets for experience goods, therefore, <lb/>have the capacity to self-correct as demand will be responsive over time to changes in product quality, <lb/>particularly with repeated transactions. Markets for experience goods with infrequent purchases often <lb/>require some additional structures to effect the transaction (e.g. brands, warranties and certifications). In <lb/>the long run, the consumer will have near perfect information about product quality. <lb/>The problem is more difficult in the case of credence goods, which cover many aspects of food <lb/>quality. For these goods, information about product quality attributes cannot be discerned by the consumer, <lb/>before purchase and even after repeated consumption of the food item. Models based on informed <lb/>consumers and seller reputation in markets for experience attributes do not function well for credence <lb/>attributes such as nutritional quality and production methods. Asymmetry in information is also a feature <lb/>of markets for credence food products with users having less information about the inherent quality <lb/>attributes of the product than sellers. Although transactions may be possible in unregulated markets for <lb/>credence goods, the absence of complete consumer knowledge severely limits the potential for an <lb/>economically efficient outcome. Many food products have elements of both experience and credence <lb/>attributes. As a result, agricultural and food products can be viewed as a complex array of quality attributes <lb/>that are packaged together in different combinations and quantities, many of which are not directly <lb/>observable at the time of purchase or even following consumption [Henson, 2006]. In order to function <lb/>correctly, these markets require some public regulatory structure or private quality signal to address the <lb/>consumer information uncertainty. <lb/>Credence type attributes of food quality such as &quot; organic &quot; or &quot; fair trade &quot; are not usually considered to <lb/>be public goods. They are characteristics that some consumers are willing to pay more for, if they can be <lb/>assured of the presence of the desired attribute through &quot; quality signalling &quot; that addresses the uncertainty <lb/>faced by them in making their choice. The solution to market failure resulting from information asymmetry <lb/></body>

			<body>is essentially the provision of more information to overcome the adverse selection problem. Quality labels, <lb/>brands, warranties and certifications are designed to provide information to consumers to help reduce <lb/>information uncertainty. According to Caswell [1998], labelling can transform credence attributes to search <lb/>attributes that allow the consumer to judge the quality of the food product before purchase. However, <lb/>information will only be effective in reducing information asymmetry and to allow consumers to make <lb/>optimal choices in line with their preferences if it is processed and used by the target audience. Too much <lb/>information or that which is not specifically targeted to consumers needs runs the risk of information <lb/>overload and consumer indifference. [Verbeke, 2005]. The efficacy of a quality signal is essentially linked <lb/>to two conditions: the pertinence of the information provided and its credibility to the recipient consumer <lb/>[Valceschini, 1998]. For credence type goods, government standards are not the only approach, or <lb/>necessarily the best, to address quality information issues. Such an assessment, however, usually needs to <lb/>be made on a case by case basis. Consumers can rely on producers&apos; voluntary claims or warranties, backed <lb/>up, in some cases, by government laws to prevent deceptive claims. Alternatively, a public standard could <lb/>apply that mandates disclosure of product or production process characteristics to consumers. Consumers <lb/>could also place their trust in a certification provided by an independent third party to provide reliable <lb/>information on the desired food quality attribute [Ippolito, 2003]. In this case, either a conformity <lb/>certification of an independent third party is used, or else a public standard enforced by government testing <lb/>or inspections to ensure conformity to the standard is applied. While certificates and labels provide a <lb/>means to correct a domestic market failure, these remedies can also have trans-border effects and this issue <lb/>is taken up later in the paper. <lb/>C. <lb/>Standards: types and definitions <lb/>Standards are common in all forms of human activity and are designed to both simplify transactions <lb/>and provide an element of certainty in exchange. 5 Standards fulfil a number of diverse functions. In the <lb/>technical realm, standards lower risk, increase credibility and trust, and facilitate predictability for buyers <lb/>and sellers. Standards are necessary, therefore, for the smooth functioning of exchange between <lb/>anonymous economic agents, as parties to a transaction must be assured of the nature and quality of the <lb/>product involved. By reducing search and transaction costs and lowering risk, standards help to facilitate <lb/>exchange and trade. The efficacy of exchange is enhanced by two main functions of a standard – as a <lb/>guarantee of a minimum quality and by defining the characteristics or specifications of the product or its <lb/>production process and associated criteria of performance. Although standardisation is necessary to <lb/>facilitate market operations and implies some degree of homogeneity, it does not follow that variety per se <lb/>is undesirable. Standards reflect the needs of the groups that express them and as long as groups differ, <lb/>their optimal standards will reflect these differences [Casella, 2001]. <lb/>Following Jones and Hill (1994) Reardon and Farina (2001), grades and standards cover a collection <lb/>of technical specifications, definitions, terms and principles of classification and labelling. 6 They include <lb/>rules of weights and measures established by regulation or authority (standards) and a system of <lb/>classification based on quantifiable attributes (grades). Food &quot; product &quot; standards and grades – as opposed <lb/>to &quot; process &quot; standards – specify the characteristics of the final product. These characteristics of the product <lb/>can include shape, size, weight, safety, authenticity, energy, nutritional content and organo-leptic quality <lb/>attributes (colour/appearance, taste, texture, etc.). Commodity standards and grades exist to facilitate the <lb/>operation of agricultural and food marketing systems. However, in an increasingly globalised agricultural <lb/>5 <lb/>Standards can be defined as a specification or set of specifications that relate to some characteristics of a product or its <lb/>manufacture (Sykes, 1990). <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">6 <lb/>According to Jones and Hill [1994] grades and standards (G&amp;S) are defined parameters that segregate similar products <lb/>into categories and describe them with consistent terminology that can be commonly understood by market <lb/>participants. Standards are rules of measurement established by regulation and authority and grades are a system of <lb/>classification based on quantifiable attributes. <lb/></note>

			<body>and food economy, the role of grades and standards are shifting from the traditional or historical role of <lb/>reducing transaction costs in mass commodity markets towards a role as strategic tools for product <lb/>differentiation and market segmentation[Clayton et al., 2003]. Product standards, by nature, play a role in <lb/>markets of vertically differentiated products, i.e. products that appear in different varieties and which can <lb/>be ordered according to a certain objective scale (e.g. milk with higher or lower butter fat content). The <lb/>concept of a minimum standard is used in the context of vertically differentiated goods, by implying that <lb/>only products that reach a certain level of quality or higher are considered to meet the standard. <lb/>As opposed to &quot; product &quot; standards, food &quot; process &quot; standards specify the characteristics of the <lb/>production process used to produce the food product, such as organic or biological production, free range, <lb/>use of animal welfare and environmentally friendly production processes, worker/labour conditions, fair <lb/>trade etc. Process standards specify production techniques that the preparation of a food must follow from <lb/>raw product, to processing through to the intermediate and final product for packing and distribution. <lb/>Process standards are introduced for different reasons: because they affect the goods they produce (e.g. <lb/>hygiene standards); because they affect the efficiency of the production process (e.g. network externalities) <lb/>or because they affect the environment (e.g. pollution standards) [WTO, 2005]. &quot; Performance &quot; standards <lb/>are the characteristics a product is expected to have when it reaches a certain point in the agri-food chain, <lb/>e.g. the maximum amount of pesticide residue permitted on apples when purchased by processors from <lb/>growers [Reardon and Farina, 2001]. <lb/>Following Valceschini and Saulais (2005), there are four principal criteria by which to compare and <lb/>contrast standards that together make up a system of standardisation. These criteria are illustrated in <lb/>Table 2 of Box 2. They include the origin of the standard (i.e. who creates the standard), the function or <lb/>content of the standard, how the standard is implemented and the method of control or enforcement to <lb/>ensure conformity. Food quality standards can be classified into private and public standards although the <lb/>line separating them is not always well defined. In many instances, standards adopted by governments and <lb/>based on public law have their origins in private industry. These government policies and regulations in <lb/>conjunction with input, process and performance standards for food products significantly influence how <lb/>private markets for food quality function and develop [Caswell and Mojduszka, 1996]. From the <lb/>perspectives of economic theory, the distinction between public and private standards in a functional <lb/>context depends more on whose interests are being taken into account when the standard is set and <lb/>enforced. For a public standard, based on a public law and set by the government, it is assumed that the <lb/>interests of all actors in the economy -both producers and consumers and society at large (externalities) -<lb/>are taken into consideration. Private standards, on the other hand, are assumed to take account of the <lb/>profits and interests of firms, producers or private bodies. They can be expected to reflect the interests of <lb/>consumers, but only to the extent that such interests correspond to those of the firm and are reflected in the <lb/>price. Standards can also be set by non-government organisations (NGOs), which form another category of <lb/>private standards. NGOs tend to be non-profit oriented and do not necessarily pursue the same objectives <lb/>as governments in standard setting [WTO, 2005]. Table 1 provides a classification of the different types of <lb/>public food quality standards according to four basic dimensions of goals, attribute focus, breadth of <lb/>coverage and scope. <lb/></body>

Towards a Safe and Open Global <lb/>System, Institute of International Economics, Washington DC, p18. <lb/>Private standards are by definition voluntary, but public standards can be either voluntary or <lb/>mandatory. Voluntary consensus standards arise from a formal coordination process involving participants <lb/>in a market and this may occur with or without the participation of government [Henson and Reardon, <lb/>2005]. Voluntary public standards are often combined with certain government labels such as the EU&apos;s <lb/>labels of protected designation of origin (PDO), of protected geographical indication (PGI) and of <lb/>traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG). These are usually non-product related standards, although product <lb/>related production standards also exist (e.g. standards on organic production). Voluntary standards whether <lb/>public or private, and with compliance communicated by labels, provide a mechanism to overcome the <lb/>information asymmetry problem. Countries can choose from several different types of labelling schemes <lb/>that allocate the information provision task to private and public sectors in different ways. These different <lb/>approaches based on voluntary and mandatory regulations are illustrated in Table 2. Following [Josling <lb/>et al., 2004] the first regime provides an example of a labelling procedure for geographical indications for <lb/>food products. Here the industry develops and adopts the standards that make the product eligible for <lb/>designation from a specific region. In the second regime the government plays a large role in the control of <lb/>voluntary claims of such thing as product identity that reduce consumer uncertainty and possibilities of <lb/>quality deception. The third and fourth regimes are based on labelling procedures that require mandatory <lb/>disclosure of information; in one case for labelling a country of origin product and the other for labelling a <lb/>content attribute such as the nutritional composition of a product. <lb/></body>

			<body>In the case of mandatory (minimum) quality standards, as only food products meeting these standards <lb/>are allowed to be sold in a market, they have the effect of reducing the range of products available for <lb/>consumption, with potential price implications. A broad definition of standards includes mandatory <lb/>technical regulations as well as voluntary agreements on the quality characteristics of goods and services. 7 <lb/>Mandatory standards are standards set by public agencies and for which compliance is obligatory. While <lb/>private or proprietary standards are voluntary standards, in many instances they have become de facto <lb/>obligatory because of wide acceptance by market participants due to dominant share in the market or <lb/>practice, or when compliance with them is a requirement for suppliers to access the proprietary value chain <lb/>of some large food retailers and food service firms. <lb/>Table 2.

The expression &quot; defacto mandatory standard &quot; is used in the <lb/>sense that the private standard of a food buying firm becomes virtually obligatory for food supplying firms who wish to <lb/>be able to supply or sell food products to the downstream buying firm.

			<body>Box 2. A paradigm of standards <lb/>Box 2 Table1 illustrates the different types of standards. Following Henson [2004], standards can be <lb/>considered as a continuum characterized according to the degree to which users have freedom of choice and <lb/>action regarding compliance (Box 2 Figure 1). At one end of the continuum are mandatory public regulations <lb/>establishing standards and grades for minimum food quality and at the other end voluntary standards where users <lb/>can decide to comply with or not and take the associated economic consequences that each decision implies. <lb/>Voluntary standards can become de facto mandatory or obligatory on market participants since suppliers are <lb/>obliged to comply with them if they wish to enter or remain within a particular market. Thus, voluntary proprietary <lb/>standards of buyers in the food chain can exclude potential food suppliers from entering into a market if they are <lb/>unable to meet the buyer&apos;s established standards. <lb/>Box 2 Table 1.

			<body>Box 2 Figure 1. Forms of standards <lb/>Source: S. Henson and J. Caswell [1999]. <lb/>By applying this distinction between mandatory and voluntary standards, it is possible to define a two-<lb/>dimensional classification of standards (Box 2 Figure 2) that has been widely applied in the literature [Henson, 2005]. <lb/>This classification can be used to compare standardization for products and processes within and across countries. <lb/>For example, in the case of countries at low levels of development, most standards fall into the mandatory public <lb/>quadrant of Box 2 Figure 2. While public standards may exist on the rule books in least developed countries they may <lb/>not have much effect in practice, if not enforced by state authorities due to a lack of resources. As the economy <lb/>develops and becomes more integrated into the global market place, there is typically increased incidence of voluntary <lb/>public standards, particularly for the export sector, and then private standards increase. In the case of developed <lb/>countries, many private proprietary standards have become de facto obligatory for market participants as dominant <lb/>firms impose their requirements on suppliers through the processes of market competition based on quality <lb/>differentiation. <lb/>In most markets voluntary and mandatory standards exist and operate side by side with considerable <lb/>interrelationship and dependencies between them. In the past, most standards introduced by public regulatory <lb/>institutions were mandatory and those applied by private entities were voluntary. However, increasingly public <lb/>agencies have developed voluntary standards (e.g. label rouge in France), whereas it is recognized that the food <lb/>standards of large private food retailers and food service companies with market power can become de facto <lb/>obligatory. Voluntary standards can also evolve as a mechanism to facilitate compliance with mandatory standards or <lb/>to demonstrate such compliance. For example, compliance with voluntary standards (i.e. application of HACCP <lb/>systems) can be used to demonstrate &apos;due diligence&apos; with respect to legal product liability standards. Mandatory <lb/>standards can also reference private standards as part of their requirements. This can reinforce the voluntary use of <lb/>such standards and increase their acceptance. It also helps to ensure that standards institutions seek to consult with <lb/>industries in the standard setting process; when the use of voluntary standards becomes widespread, they may <lb/>become incorporated in mandatory public standards. In this way, voluntary and mandatory standards can be seen as <lb/>complementary and equal components of systems of standardization. <lb/>A further distinction can be made between national standards and standards developed by countries on a <lb/>collective or multilateral basis. In some circumstances adoption of international standards can be a cost effective way <lb/>to upgrade domestic standards in order to meet international market requirements. The efficacy of this approach to <lb/>standard setting is dependent on the extent to which international standards reflect domestic needs and <lb/>circumstances. Where they do not take adequate account of local conditions, costs of compliance can be greater than <lb/>what is required for domestically based standards. <lb/>Freedom of Action <lb/>Low <lb/>High <lb/>Mandatory <lb/>Defacto Obligatory <lb/>Standards <lb/>Voluntary <lb/>Standards <lb/>Standards <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 2 Figure 2. A paradigm for standards <lb/>Mandatory <lb/>Public <lb/>Private <lb/>Voluntary <lb/>Source: Henson, S. (2004). <lb/>Most types of standards and particularly mandatory regulations will have the effect of increasing <lb/>production and other compliance costs for at least some firms in the food chain. Product standards may <lb/>have lower cost implications than process standards, as the former allow firms more flexibility to choose <lb/>the least costly production methods that meet the standards [Unnevehr and Jensen, 1996; Segerson, 1998]. <lb/>The implementation of standards will normally also lead to increased costs for consumers in the form of <lb/>higher prices of food products and potentially less variety of choice. While the evolution of (private) <lb/>standards reflects in part changes in consumer demands and preferences, the consumption of food, on the <lb/>other hand, is increasingly being structured by the development of standards. This reflects the proliferation <lb/>and diversification of public and private standards over time. This evolution is being driven by increasing <lb/>regulatory requirements with scientific and technological developments and increasing knowledge as well <lb/>as by rising consumer demand and changing preferences for food diversity and higher quality products. <lb/>The general &quot; ratcheting-up &quot; of quality standards is also contributing to a closer integration between public <lb/>and private standards. The question that arises is whether this is leading to a coherent system of food <lb/>standards as a whole. Furthermore, in view of the growing importance of private voluntary standards in the <lb/>food sector that is predicated, in many instances, on higher food quality, what is the legitimate role for <lb/>public food quality standards in a dynamic food sector? <lb/>D. <lb/>The rational for government food standards <lb/>Due to differences in information requirements, the classification of goods as to the information <lb/>available to consumers that was discussed in the previous section pose different issues for public standards <lb/>and regulations. In the case of search type goods, as producers face a risk of loss of business and revenue <lb/>from selling inferior goods they have an incentive to provide the range of quality that consumers are <lb/>willing to pay for. For such food products, consumers have near perfect information about product quality <lb/>before buying the food item. In these cases, consumers are generally capable of protecting themselves or, <lb/>at worst will suffer only temporary damage to their purse, and not their health, if a product does not live up <lb/>to perceived quality expectations. Markets for search goods and attributes would normally, therefore, be <lb/>only a minor focus of government regulatory activities. <lb/>However, in markets for experience goods, which cover many other aspects of food quality, producers <lb/>possess superior information to consumers on the quality of the products on sale. As consumers can only <lb/>identify the quality attributes of experience goods after consumption, public regulation -for instance <lb/>through a requirement for quality information labelling or through the provision of product liability <lb/>legislation -is likely to be more useful than for search good markets. Labelling regulations help to <lb/></body>

			<body>alleviate market imperfections based on information deficiencies and have the effect of transforming <lb/>experience attributes into search attributes in goods. As these markets have the potential to self-correct in <lb/>the sense that complete information for quality selection is eventually available, perhaps through repeated <lb/>purchases of the same food item, no informational asymmetries or other reasons for market failure exist in <lb/>the longer run. In this situation, mandatory regulatory intervention on the part of public agencies has been <lb/>shown in the literature to lead to a decrease in social welfare [Bocksteal, 1984]. <lb/>As informational deficiencies faced by consumers with respect to food quality are even more <lb/>profound in the case of credence type attributes, policy makers often choose to intervene by imposing a <lb/>mandatory standard or label requirement to signal quality in this case. Regulatory oversight of producers&apos; <lb/>quality claims is viewed as a responsibility of the public sector and particularly in the case of the many <lb/>food products that carry no brands where reputational mechanisms (i.e. associating a particular food firm <lb/>with a product) are missing to protect the integrity of market transactions. These regulations can solve the <lb/>information problem, remedy the market failure and increase market efficiency. Direct government <lb/>regulation can take place through enforcement of standards for production processes used to produce food <lb/>or by specifying a level of quality for the final product. Standards thus provide a mechanism through which <lb/>public authorities can regulate the food system in order to ensure social food quality objectives are <lb/>addressed at the level desired. Mandatory standards in this situation act like a minimum standard in <lb/>removing from the market those products not meeting the desired quality standard [WTO, 2005]. In this <lb/>way, government standards facilitate the availability of improved information on food quality and have the <lb/>potential to be open and balanced in assessing the various trade-offs involved. These standards can create <lb/>greater accountability for the food industry by discouraging irresponsible activities and rewarding <lb/>beneficial efforts. Furthermore, public regulators can more easily establish a single standard with certainty, <lb/>such as for example an &quot; organic &quot; standard, than private actors and can prosecute any violators under the <lb/>law [McCluskey, 2006]. However in establishing standards, governments can also be subject to interest <lb/>group pressures and if standards are mandatory they have more potential to act as an exclusionary device. <lb/>Special interests that would be adversely affected by a change can have an incentive to block movement <lb/>and government standard setting procedures in some countries may facilitate such efforts of regulatory <lb/>capture. While it is always difficult to generalise, public standards can display a tendency to be less <lb/>flexible than private protocols in reacting to changing circumstances and do not usually provide incentives <lb/>for innovation. Once in place, government standards can be difficult to change as science and technology <lb/>evolve or as consumer preferences change. In addition, government standards shift the development costs <lb/>to the general taxpayer rather than the potential beneficiary of the standard, possibly leading to more <lb/>lengthy and costly processes. An example of this is the &quot; organic &quot; standard in the US that took some eight <lb/>years to develop [Ippolito, 2003]. However, this problem of standard &apos;lock-in &quot; on a possibly less than <lb/>optimal path, is also apparent with some industry standards that have been effectively imposed by one or <lb/>two companies. Examples can be found in areas where compatibility standards are critical, and first mover <lb/>advantages exist in achieving market share which may take precedence over product quality (e.g. current <lb/>DVD standard). <lb/>Public standards often take the form of mandatory minimum quality standards (MQS) as discussed in <lb/>Box 1, and have the effect of increasing the provision of some desirable attribute of the food product. <lb/>Traditionally these standards have been enforced through official inspection of production facilities and or <lb/>end products, and at considerable public cost [Henson, 2006]. Government food quality standards, backed <lb/>up by the force of law, can have a major influence on the operation of food markets and have been an <lb/>important factor in shaping their development. In most cases, public standards have been beneficial in <lb/>improving food quality. For example, minimum fat and milk solids requirements increase the nutritional <lb/>content of fluid milk. Product quality regulations such as grading standards for fresh fruit also produce <lb/>some desirable consumption characteristics as well as public good aspects. For instance, regulation that <lb/>prohibits or limits pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables will likely reduce the amount of pesticides <lb/>used by farmers and thus contribute to improved environmental quality [Sunding, 2003]. However, there <lb/></body>

			<body>are also a few examples where such regulations have not automatically led to quality improvements. One <lb/>example cited in the literature is USDA&apos;s early beef grading system. These grading standards tended to <lb/>compensate producers for producing larger cattle (i.e. quantity of meat produced) and not for meat quality <lb/>improvements as they inadequately defined beef eating quality characteristics. As a result, beef <lb/>consumption in the United States declined with lower quality meat. Private protocols in the form of private <lb/>brands and quality labels then emerged to address this quality deficiency, with the role of USDA shifting to <lb/>that of an independent auditor of whether these private standards have been met [Ferrier and Lamb, 2007]. <lb/>The prima facie rationale for public regulatory standards in the food sector has been to both reduce <lb/>the risks to human health from consumption of inferior or below standard quality foods and to protect <lb/>consumers from fraud or deceptive practices of sellers in relation to measurement and voluntary quality <lb/>claims [Henson and Traill, 1993; Antle, 1995]. The desire to protect consumers and to promote particular <lb/>values (i.e. local foods) and food preparation processes has led to increasing government involvement in <lb/>the control of non health aspects of food quality attributes (e.g. country of origin, organic, protected <lb/>designation of origin or PDOs, protected geographical indication or PGIs, GMOs etc) [Garcia Martinez, <lb/>et al., 2007]. Grades and standards have a long history in grain markets and were initially promulgated to <lb/>facilitate arms length transactions for largely homogenous goods 8 . They were also used to prevent misuse <lb/>or fraud in relation to weights and measures such as the prevalence of stones and other foreign matter <lb/>being included in flour to increase its weight in transactions between flour millers and buyers [Kindlberger, <lb/>1983; Hill, 1990]. In the context of mass markets for largely homogenous commodities, public standards <lb/>have public good characteristics, allow economies of scale in transactions, lower search costs of market <lb/>participants and will likely continue to predominate over private standards [World Bank, 2005]. However, <lb/>the role of grades and standards is also changing with globalisation of agro-food systems, and a shift from <lb/>commodity oriented mass markets towards markets of highly differentiated products. This is leading to a <lb/>shift in focus of grades and standards from product outcomes (measurable product attributes) towards <lb/>product processes (i.e. how the product is produced, processed, distributed etc) [Clayton et al., 2003] <lb/>Regulators may also assist in correcting market failure due to quality uncertainty through the <lb/>promulgation of definitional standards that help to prevent consumer deception and fraud [Becker, 1999]. <lb/>This can be useful in relation to process quality and specific characteristics of the production process, such <lb/>as the definition for organic production. This was apparently the case in the United States when USDA set <lb/>a national organic standard which defined what constitutes an organic product. Prior to the promulgation of <lb/>the national standard, some organic foods were certified under state and private certification programmes, <lb/>but consumers were often confused as to what the term actually meant which opened the door to fraud and <lb/>quality misrepresentation. In some European countries, voluntary public standards are frequently combined <lb/>with government labels such as the EU&apos;s labels of PDOs, of PGIs and of traditional speciality guaranteed <lb/>(TSG) which have been established for the benefit of private agricultural producers. These are examples of <lb/>public and private cooperation in quality assurance. The private producers and their representative body set <lb/>the details of the production process covered by the standard. Granting of the public label requires that <lb/>inspection, control and certification be made by an independent third party, usually accredited by the <lb/>public regulator to assure the presence of the relevant credence attributes based on traditional production <lb/>processes and a designated origin [Young and Hobbs, 2002]. <lb/>For some aspects of product quality, related to human health, it is unclear, however, how acceptable <lb/>informational labelling is to policy makers, food companies and consumers [Caswell and Mojduszka, <lb/>1996]. Governments usually prefer to avoid any risk (other than perhaps that of moral hazard) by <lb/>promulgating a mandatory standard in such situations. In recent years, public food standards have tended to <lb/>8 <lb/>The terms &quot; standard &quot; and &quot; grade &quot; have overlapping uses. The basic distinction is that a grade is a designation that <lb/>places a product in a qualitative category, whereas a standard is a measurable threshold that a commodity has to meet <lb/>in order to qualify as a specified food product (identity standard) or grade of product (grade standard) [Gardner 2003] <lb/></body>

			<body>become stricter and more complex, with a greater emphasis on science and a systems approach. At the <lb/>same time, many governments have initiated efforts to apply food quality regulations in ways that are less <lb/>burdensome on food companies. This has led to some shift towards performance based measures that <lb/>afford suppliers greater flexibility to achieve the desired level of food quality in the most cost effective <lb/>manner [Flynn et al., 2003]. In addition, requirements are progressively being put in place for process <lb/>controls based on the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) for the <lb/>manufacture of food in recognition that end product testing is an expensive and inefficient form of food <lb/>quality control. The form in which food quality regulation is applied has implications for the level and <lb/>form of enforcement used by public authorities to assure food quality. Performance based regulation, when <lb/>paired with HACCP process standards and product traceability, relies mainly on enforcement through <lb/>inspection of firm audits of production records. This replaces the need for regular product inspection and <lb/>firm plant visits under traditional procedures, reducing the costs of enforcement and shifting the role of <lb/>government to one of oversight of the food quality system and its performance. <lb/>In the context of the shift that is occurring in public policy in a number of countries from regulating <lb/>the product to regulating the process or emphasising performance criteria for achieving food quality (e.g. <lb/>requirements for HACCP), one issue that arises is whether compliance should be achieved with voluntary <lb/>or mandatory standards. The usual assumption in favour of voluntary arrangements is that they have a cost <lb/>advantage for firms in terms of lower compliance and transaction costs when compared with mandatory <lb/>standards. However, a common trend across developed countries is the increasing relevance of government <lb/>regulation based on mandatory HACCP procedures for certain foods and processed products. This <lb/>development raises the question of whether mandatory government intervention necessarily implies higher <lb/>compliance and transaction costs. If they do not, the threat of mandatory regulation may not be sufficient to <lb/>motivate firms to adopt voluntary measures to improve food quality and mandatory approaches may be <lb/>welfare improving [Venturini, 2002]. This may explain the increasing use of mandatory HACCP-based <lb/>systems in many advanced countries. <lb/>As part of the change in the public role, there has been a trend in some countries towards shifting <lb/>more responsibility for ensuring food quality to the private sector based on private standard protocols and <lb/>certification of system compliance by independent third parties. An example is provided by the procedures <lb/>for quality controls developed in France for importers of fruit and vegetables. Since 1998, importers of <lb/>fruit and vegetables in France have been responsible for undertaking quality controls themselves based on <lb/>a system of auto-control to ensure that minimum residue levels of pesticides and other chemicals present in <lb/>fruit and vegetables satisfy the French standard. The auto-control agreement based on HACCP procedures <lb/>is negotiated between the various sellers and their representative body and approved by the public <lb/>authorities. The representative body of the fruit and vegetable sellers is assigned the responsibility to <lb/>ensure that participating sellers undertake the designated quality controls and respect their commitment. <lb/>The agreement is enforced by the threat of exclusion. The role of the public authorities has been changed <lb/>from carrying out product inspections to checking that fruit and vegetable sellers undertake their auto-<lb/>controls correctly. For this second level control, the authorities rely on reports submitted by sellers on the <lb/>auto-controls carried out. For the public authorities delegation of quality controls to the sellers themselves <lb/>has a number of objectives. These include extending the number and effective coverage of quality controls <lb/>over the market, reducing the cost of public product inspections and releasing these resources for use in <lb/>other sectors where risks may be higher (e.g. meat products) and making public controls more results <lb/>orientated. For the sellers, it allows them to reduce the scope and frequency of public controls and to share <lb/>the cost of auto-control with any required scientific analysis undertaken at a single laboratory at a <lb/>preferential rate which gives them access to economies of scale in implementing the controls. Finally it <lb/>also reduces the extent of their legal responsibility in the event of a quality anomaly being detected, if the <lb/>public authorities consider the sellers have mobilised sufficient resources for the auto-controls procedures. <lb/>If the auto-controls are correctly implemented sellers are not held responsible under criminal law for any <lb/></body>

			<body>quality anomaly. In the event that a quality violation is detected, the seller is required to notify their <lb/>representative body who then informs the public authorities of the anomaly [Codron, et al. 2005]. <lb/>The foregoing provides an example of increased co-ordination and co-operation that is taking place <lb/>between public and private actors in some countries in relation to food standards. The evolution of EU <lb/>food quality legislation provides another example. With the passage of EU food hygiene regulations from <lb/>1 January 2006, responsibility for the production of safe food lies with food business operators. All food <lb/>businesses are required to have controls that demonstrate they are managing food quality within their <lb/>businesses. This represents a shift from a largely prescriptive control approach towards an enforced self-<lb/>regulatory approach with the regulator imposing a requirement on food businesses to determine and <lb/>implement their own internal rules and procedures to fulfil the regulators policy objectives. The regulator <lb/>is then responsible for approving these internalised rules and for monitoring compliance. While national <lb/>legislation is not required to give effect to the EU legislation beyond providing for their enforcement in <lb/>national jurisdictions, in many cases there are areas that allow member states to adopt additional provisions <lb/>as appropriate in their national law [Garcia Martinez et al. 2007]. Some shift in focus of regulation is also <lb/>occurring in the US, from a predominately prescriptive process and product standards to more flexible <lb/>performance-based standards that allow food businesses greater choice in the mode of implementation. <lb/>However, for Canada, the predominant approach is still based mainly on detailed process and product <lb/>standards with enforcement through plant level inspection. Although there has occurred a change in focus <lb/>of food quality regulations in the meat and poultry processing sector with a shift of responsibility towards <lb/>food businesses and mandatory application of HACCP procedures. Processing firms have been granted <lb/>some flexibility by the authorities to implement food quality control systems that reflect their own <lb/>particular circumstances [Garcia Martinez et al., 2007]. The inspection authorities then audit the control <lb/>procedures and records of performance. A question remains, however, whether the move from a <lb/>prescriptive to a self-regulatory approach that is evident in a number of countries is fully acceptable to all <lb/>stakeholders, particularly consumers. <lb/>There may be other co-regulation opportunities whereby government agencies can rely more on <lb/>private mechanisms of food quality control, including implementation of systems such as the ISO 22000 <lb/>series. For example, compliance with such system standards may enable enforcement authorities to <lb/>distinguish between high and low risk food products and establishments and focus their inspection efforts <lb/>accordingly. This, however, requires the confidence of enforcement authorities in the efficacy of private <lb/>standards to assess and maintain compliance with legal public food quality standards. Co-ordination of <lb/>public and private food quality management can potentially result in improvements in the level of food <lb/>quality at lower cost and more effective allocation of regulatory resources. However, the scope for co-<lb/>regulation may depend on the nature of established regulatory and institutional arrangements that differ <lb/>between countries. Recent developments in the EU regulatory environment appear to be providing a wider <lb/>range of opportunities for closer collaboration between regulatory agencies and the private sector through <lb/>the operation of food supply chains, but to date co-regulation remains limited in practice. The formulation <lb/>of coordinated food quality policies that pursue both private and social benefits remains a significant <lb/>challenge to such procedures [Garcia Martinez, 2007]. Other examples of such public-private coordination <lb/>of a more longstanding nature are the quality labels based on protected geographical indications (PGI), <lb/>protected designation of origin (PDO) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) that have been <lb/>established for the benefit of agricultural producers in France and other parts of Europe and which are now <lb/>enshrined in European Union law. As has been noted, these standards are developed by private producers <lb/>and a representative body, with public authorities ensuring enforcement through certification that the <lb/>standards are met. <lb/>In some cases, the transition to increased private sector responsibility is being reinforced by ex-post <lb/>product liability legislation to provide effective incentives to food producers to sell products of acceptable <lb/>quality in the first instance. In addition to fulfilling more rigorous product and process standards, firms are <lb/></body>

			<body>also legally accountable under product liability laws, for damage or harm resulting from a food product <lb/>sold by them. This legal recourse reflects a rise in prominence of both tort liability standards [Buzby et al, <lb/>2001] and a duty of care of food sellers with respect to their food quality obligations based on the concept <lb/>of &quot; due diligence &quot; [Henson and Northen, 1998; OECD, 2004; Henson, 2006]. The introduction of a &quot; due <lb/>diligence &quot; defence under legislation enacted in the UK gave the first major impetus to the development of <lb/>higher private standards for this reason [Hobbs and Kerr, 1992]. <lb/>Under this defence, food sellers are required to demonstrate that they have been proactive in ensuring <lb/>that the food they handle and any food obtained from upstream suppliers, conforms to legal food standards. <lb/>Food retailers initially responded to this requirement by enhancing their food quality controls, and those <lb/>for their suppliers, which were enforced by a second party audit. This was extended further with the <lb/>introduction of a Rapid Alert System backed up by product traceability within the EU through which <lb/>products in contravention of food quality requirements are made available through a public database <lb/>[Henson, 2006]. The introduction of product liability legislation has encouraged firms to set up standards <lb/>that exceed those required for meeting public standards and passing the government approval process <lb/>[Antle, 1995]. The risk of legal liability of a food supplier can thus work to assure compliance with the <lb/>public food quality regulation. This has been accompanied by a shift of the public role to one of auditing or <lb/>performance oversight based on a system of controls applied by private firms and monitoring their <lb/>performance based on the results achieved [Jaffee and Henson, 2004]. <lb/>Fundamental differences in national legal systems and institutions for protecting consumers from poor <lb/>quality food products provide some justification for diverging conceptions on the role of government in <lb/>setting and securing compliance with public food standards. Differences in the legal treatment between <lb/>ex ante regulation vis-á-vis ex post litigation, go some way to explaining differences in governmental food <lb/>standards between countries [Buzby and Frenzen, 1999]. As this approach is not yet widely applied by <lb/>many countries, ex ante regulatory measures through the enforcement of mandatory standards remains the <lb/>dominant approach of public policy to ensure the supply of food that meets established quality <lb/>requirements. <lb/>E. <lb/>The rise of private standards and protocols <lb/>Much of the focus of the literature on standards has been on the role of public food quality standards <lb/>both as policy instruments and as potential barriers to trade [Henson and Hooker, 2001]. While public <lb/>standards have been a feature of national food systems for many years, private standards are a relatively <lb/>recent element of the food quality landscape and their scope and coverage differs widely across countries <lb/>and food products. Private standards have proliferated in a number of industrial countries in recent years, <lb/>operating alongside public regulatory systems and are playing an increasing role in the governance of <lb/>agricultural and food supply chains. To some extent, private food quality standards have emerged in <lb/>response to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and reputational risks, including product <lb/>liability exposure, faced by leading firms operating supply chains, most notably major food retailers and <lb/>food service firms. However they have also been employed to facilitate competitive strategies of product <lb/>differentiation on the basis of an increasingly wide array of food quality characteristics or attributes <lb/>designed to respond to new consumer demands and concerns [Henson, 2006]. Private standards are now <lb/>well established in a number of developed countries and are gradually extending their global reach to <lb/>middle income and some low-income countries [Henson and Reardon, 2005]. The latter reflects in part the <lb/>consolidation that has taken place in the food sector resulting in increasing ownership concentration with a <lb/>declining number of large multinational food retail chains, food service operators and food manufacturers. <lb/>These firms have the bargaining power to impose their proprietary standards on different suppliers in <lb/>sourcing their products from wide geographical areas and through competitive strategies centred on their <lb/>own or private brands when operating across national borders. As a consequence, national food quality <lb/>control systems in many developed countries increasingly reflect a mix of public and private standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>Despite this growth, private standards are still by no means universal in their coverage with public <lb/>standards continuing to dominate in some countries and for particular food product attributes and <lb/>categories. <lb/>Private food standards continue to evolve in response to a general ratcheting-up of regulatory <lb/>requirements about food quality and in response to changing consumer preferences and demand for higher <lb/>quality and more varied food in general. Private food standards have enabled firms to meet these <lb/>challenges as well as to differentiate their products and to refocus agricultural and food markets from <lb/>price-based to quality-based competition. The role of private standards is supported on the demand side by <lb/>affluent consumers in developed countries with sophisticated and varied tastes and on the supply side by <lb/>production, processing and distribution technologies that allow product differentiation and market <lb/>extension and segmentation. As noted, this shift has led to some changes in the role played by grades and <lb/>standards. In addition to reducing transaction costs of commodity market participants, they are now also <lb/>serving as strategic tools of private firms for market penetration, system coordination, quality and safety <lb/>assurance, brand recognition and product niche definition [Henson and Reardon, 2005] (see Box 2). By <lb/>enabling firms to capture the benefits of any food quality attributes they supply, private standards provide <lb/>the incentives for these firms to make the required investments to achieve enhanced food quality and the <lb/>means to motivate their suppliers through price premia and other preferential supply terms in governing <lb/>expansive supply chains [Henson, 2006]. <lb/>Consumers for their part are increasingly focused on a broader range of product attributes when <lb/>assessing the quality of food and agricultural products and this has strengthened the role of private agri-<lb/>food quality standards. For instance, at higher levels of income, consumers demand relatively higher levels <lb/>of enhanced attributes associated with food quality, nutrition, health promotion and traceability [Kinsey, <lb/>2004]. Food businesses operating in a dynamic agro-food system that is generally characterised by low <lb/>margins and inelastic demand, have responded to these consumer demands with private standards as an <lb/>integral part of their competitive strategies as they seek to communicate their approach to food quality and <lb/>diversity to consumers [Fulponi, 2006]. Private standards are used to inform consumers about different <lb/>quality attributes and have the effect of increasing consumer loyalty while lowering the price elasticity for <lb/>the food product concerned to reward food suppliers through higher prices for undertaking investment in <lb/>quality management systems [Kinsey, 2004]. <lb/>In addition to product differentiation and market segmentation, private standards provide firms with <lb/>the means to better co-ordinate or govern production, input supplies and distribution activities that generate <lb/>efficiency gains and cost savings [Holleran, 1999]. This can lead to lower transaction costs, better <lb/>management of supplies across wide geographical areas that may cut across national borders and to <lb/>standardisation of product requirements over a range of suppliers [Henson and Reardon, 2005]. Standards <lb/>also permit the production, identification and maintenance of product and process attributes along the <lb/>entire supply chain over time to achieve a consistent supply of food quality attributes supported by own <lb/>brands and certification [Bergès-Sennou et al., 2004]. This is particularly critical for credence attributes <lb/>that relate to the way food products are produced and handled [Henson and Traill, 1993]. <lb/>Although private standards are necessarily voluntary in nature, they may be applied by the majority of <lb/>suppliers, reflecting the economic advantage of standardisation or market requirements. In terms of the <lb/>latter, proprietary private standards may become virtually obligatory or &quot; de facto &quot; mandatory in some <lb/>agricultural and food markets as supplying firms have little option but to comply in order to enter or <lb/>remain within a market effectively controlled by a few large buyers with oligopsonistic power [Henson and <lb/>Northen, 1998]. The end result can be the same as if a public regulation had been imposed. For example, <lb/> &quot; dolphin-safe &quot; tuna fish is a purely voluntary designation, but tins of tuna without the dolphin-safe label <lb/>have now disappeared from retail store shelves in the United States. This private standard has been widely <lb/>applied in practice and has now become the de facto industry standard. Proprietary private standards are <lb/></body>

			<body>especially prominent among large food retailers, food manufacturers and food service operators, reflecting <lb/>their considerable market power and competitive strategies based around private brands that tie the firm&apos;s <lb/>reputation and performance to the quality of the products it supplies [Henson, 2006]. Drives to enhance <lb/>minimum quality standards, differentiate products and at the same time to manage transaction costs and the <lb/>risks of large supply chains, has provided considerable impetus for the evolution of private food quality <lb/>standards, most notably in Europe. These factors suggest that private food quality standards tend to be <lb/>more pro-active and agile and thus likely subject to more rapid change than public modes of food <lb/>regulation as firms seek to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences. Overall, private voluntary <lb/>standards predicated on achieving higher quality food products, and which offer increased flexibility and <lb/>responsiveness to cater to changing consumer demands for variety over a range of quality dimensions, are <lb/>rapidly becoming a major driver in agri-food markets and a global phenomenon[Henson and Reardon, <lb/>2005]. <lb/>However, it needs to be acknowledged that private standards as a fairly recent addition to national <lb/>food systems have not emerged in isolation. The development of private protocols and brands has been <lb/>facilitated by the fact that they have, in many instances, been built on the foundation provided by the <lb/>existing public standards infrastructure. The public minimum quality standards provided the initial basis <lb/>for launching a quality differentiation of the private product at a more reasonable cost, while at the same <lb/>time reducing opportunities for fraud and abuse. Thus, the evolution and specific forms taken by private <lb/>standards reflect, at least in part, prevailing national public standards. In other cases, private standards <lb/>simply adopted aspects of public standards such as minimum food safety and hygiene requirements and <lb/>these became a common and non-competitive element of private standards. Private standards have also <lb/>evolved in response to changes in the level and nature of pubic regulatory requirements. As public <lb/>regulations and standards have changed, become increasingly stringent and applied more widely, this has <lb/>encouraged higher private food standards as well to allow a food company to continue to differentiate its <lb/>products from the more generic unbranded foods that meet the higher public minimum quality standard <lb/>(MQS). As a result, any change in the public MQS requirement leads to a modification of private strategies <lb/>of quality differentiation [Codron et al., 2005]. In other cases, inadequate public food standards have been <lb/>a motivating factor. Firms will also have an incentive to implement private standards when public food <lb/>quality standards are missing or judged inadequate (or otherwise unenforced). In this situation, private <lb/>standards can act as a substitute for missing or ineffective public regulations [Reardon et al. 2001; Henson <lb/>and Reardon, 2005]. This has reportedly been the situation in some least developed countries where private <lb/>standards developed by some multinational food retailers for their home markets have been also applied in <lb/>less developed countries to the advantage of local consumers [Reardon and Berdegeue, 2002]. Private <lb/>standards may even develop when public regulations already provide a high level of food quality. This may <lb/>occur because private standards can be implemented as a means to limit a firms&apos; exposure to ex post <lb/>product liability, to mitigate risk of reputational damage, if the firm has been found to sell food that does <lb/>not meet the public minimum quality standards, or to pre-empt additional regulatory measures [Lutz et al., <lb/>2000]. <lb/>In reflection of these various developments and pressures, private standards, which are increasingly <lb/>buyer-driven in nature and global in reach, are seen as important drivers of change in agri-food systems of <lb/>developed and increasingly developing countries [Henson and Hooker, 2001]. The promulgation of private <lb/>food quality standards has been supported by the development of quality meta-systems such as Hazard <lb/>Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) procedures, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good <lb/>Agricultural Practice (GAP) and so forth [Caswell et al., 1998]. Some observers have viewed such meta-<lb/>systems as &quot; codes of conduct &quot; for participation in the agri-food system and achieving a particular food <lb/>quality attribute [Henson and Reardon, 2005]. Increasingly such systems are seen as governing the <lb/>operation of the entire supply chain from farm production and processing to distribution and final retail <lb/>sale of the food product [Dolan and Humphrey, 2001; Fulponi, 2006]. Some of these quality meta-systems <lb/>are embedded in voluntary public standards at the national or international level (e.g. ISO 22000), while <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">AGR/CA/APM(2006)21/FINAL <lb/></note>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>others are proprietary private standards developed by standards bodies (e.g. SQF 2000) or by individual <lb/>food companies (e.g. Tesco&apos;s Nature&apos;s Choice) [Henson, 2006]. Some of the meta-systems that started out <lb/>as voluntary codes of good practice have now been incorporated into public regulations, representing a <lb/>further blurring of the line of demarcation between public and private standards. An example is the <lb/>inclusion of HACCP as part of the regulatory requirements for meat and meat products in the United <lb/>States, Canada and the EU. Thus, while private standards may develop as a means to comply with public <lb/>regulatory requirements, there are also instances of government regulations adopting the mechanisms <lb/>employed by private standards and referencing private standards in their rules. This trend reflects the <lb/>significant institutional changes being made in the public sphere in relation to the general oversight of food <lb/>supply chains and food quality, in particular, in a number of countries. <lb/>Public and private food standards are also matched by public and private modes of enforcement of <lb/>such standards. As private firms are not always able to fully capture the returns from incorporating costly <lb/>controls of product hazards or production methods, they may lack the incentive to implement methods to <lb/>assure products that meet the higher quality standard of differentiated products and to provide the degree of <lb/>control to contain quality problems that may pose health hazards in the food product [Jensen and Hayes, <lb/>2006]. Faced with this situation, private quality assurance systems have developed on the basis of private <lb/>certification (both self, second and independent third party), improved transparency 9 and traceability. Self <lb/>regulation covers the establishment of internal control systems for product quality, while certification <lb/>involves the monitoring and certification of measurable product and process quality standards by a private <lb/>second party or independent third party organisation. Such certification may also be voluntary or stipulated <lb/>by those with whom the firm does business [WTO, 2005] and vary by products. From the literature, public <lb/>certification for food quality is high in the case of meat products in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New <lb/>Zealand and Japan. However, private certification was strongest in European Countries and weakest in the <lb/>US and Japan [Jensen and Hayes, 2006]. Regardless of the nature of the standard, third party auditors of <lb/>standards are usually approved on an individual basis by the official accreditation agency in the country in <lb/>which they operate. This represents another example where private standard regimes are reliant on public <lb/>systems of oversight to ensure their credibility [Henson, 2006]. <lb/>The success of private voluntary standards in the food sector has lead to changes in standard setting <lb/>processes, including the emergence of coalitions or consortia of firms for setting private standards. One <lb/>result of adopting higher private standards for product differentiation and competitive positioning in <lb/>markets or to guard against product tort liability has been an increase in transaction costs for individual <lb/>firms that established their own standards. As a result, pressures emerged from such firms for the <lb/>developments of collective and harmonised private standards through industry organisations and groups of <lb/>firms [e.g. British Retail Consortium (BRC), International Food Standards (IFS)], with the collective <lb/>standards certified by a third party audit (e.g. European Food Safety Inspection Service) and by private <lb/>firms as a substitute for business–to-business standards [Henson and Northen, 1998]. This had the <lb/>advantage of reducing the costs of governing the supply chain for individual firms and widening the group <lb/>of potential suppliers from which they could procure. As a result, standards of global business to business <lb/>(B2B) arrangements were extended in the form of procurement standards designed to improve overall <lb/>value chain performance and their governance [Casella 1997, 2001; Nadvi and Waltring, 2003; Fulponi, <lb/>2006]. Co-ordinated or harmonised standards can thus secure competitive advantage for member firms and <lb/>allow them to pursue common objectives in a non-competitive manner [Dolan and Humphrey, 1999; <lb/>Casella, 2001]. While food supplying and distributor companies are interested in a rationalisation of <lb/>private proprietary standards as proliferation is expensive for them in terms of additional transaction costs, <lb/>they also fear a single standard, managed by some downstream retailer or food service company, over <lb/></body>

			<body>which they have no control. They are thus faced with the challenge of balancing the cost advantages of a <lb/>single standard against the loss of freedom of action. <lb/>The focus of harmonisation efforts amongst leading firms to act collectively has also extended from <lb/>national/regional institutions (such as BRC and Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group (EUREP)) towards <lb/>international private standard organisations such as the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). These private <lb/>quality standards continue to evolve overtime from business to business, collective standards and Business <lb/>To Consumer (B2C) standards. In many cases, B2B standards that are used to support and protect wider <lb/>efforts of product differentiation are not directly communicated to consumers. However, other B2C <lb/>standards have been developed by major retailers (such as the Filière Agriculture Raisonnée by Auchan, <lb/>the Filière Qualité by Carrefour and the Finest brand by Tesco Stores PLC) and also by producer <lb/>organisations that are linked to brands or symbols where quality is communicated directly to consumers. <lb/>They are also evolving from national to regional and international standards and from first to second and <lb/>third party methods of certification and conformity testing. <lb/>As a result, agri-food systems of many countries are now pervaded by an array of interrelated public <lb/>and private standards. This proliferation of standards is leading to increasingly complex relationships <lb/>between them. Notwithstanding, a trend appears to be underway of a shift from mandatory standards as the <lb/>predominant form of control or governance over food quality that are positioned in the public sector to an <lb/>increasing role of the private sector and more voluntary forms of control. This is reflected in the growing <lb/>number and role of standards originating from private firms and groups including proprietary standards as <lb/>de facto mandatory ones in food markets [Henson, 2006]. It would appear that private standards are <lb/>assuming increasing responsibility for many aspects of food quality as the role of government shifts further <lb/>to oversight of the entire food quality system and monitoring firms&apos; quality performance through audits of <lb/>control systems and similar procedures [Henson and Hooker, 2001; Henson, 2006]. This is leading in <lb/>some instances to increased coordination and cooperation between public and private actors in standards <lb/>procedures, as the example of the French system of quality standards applied to importers of fruit and <lb/>vegetables has suggested [Codron et al. 2005]. A case may exist for exploring further co-regulatory <lb/>approaches or public/private partnerships [Garcia Martinez et al., 2005] to achieve food quality objectives <lb/>in a more efficient way. <lb/>F <lb/>Standards and trade <lb/>A further dimension to the interaction between public and private standards arises when the interests <lb/>of other countries have to be taken into account through international exchange. Governments have a <lb/>primary role in establishing trade policy and granting access to their national markets. Because standards <lb/>reflect, amongst other things, levels of industrialisation and economic development, as well as national <lb/>cultures and values, they are likely to differ between countries. The resulting heterogeneity in public <lb/>standards and regulations is likely to affect international trade. Standards play a role in international <lb/>competitiveness and their potential to act as non-tariff barriers is now widely recognised. Also, with the <lb/>development of multinational food businesses with global procurement practices, private standards now <lb/>extend across national borders and can also affect trade. The following sections examine a number of <lb/>issues that arise for international food trade as a result of heterogeneous national standards and global <lb/>private standards. Among the questions addressed are: do heterogeneous national standards and regulations <lb/>impair trade and how can these impacts be minimised? Are there additional constraints on public standards <lb/>setting practices arising from the WTO system and how do they relate to private standards of global firms? <lb/>How do international standards organisations such as the Codex Alimentarius and the International <lb/>Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) fit into the public-private standards architecture? <lb/></body>

			<body>F.i <lb/>Public standards and trade <lb/>The complexity of the interaction of public and private quality standards is considerably increased in <lb/>the context of international trade. In addition, the distinction between product and process standards has <lb/>become important in the context of the multilateral trading system, particularly process standards that <lb/>involve unincorporated processes and production methods (PPMs) 10 [WTO, 2005]. The main risk of <lb/>national public standards from a trade perspective is that they are backed by the power of the state and that <lb/>in the course of developing standards, governments can favour domestic producers over imports by <lb/>stipulating idiosyncratic production and processing methods [WTO, 2005]. These may act as non-tariff <lb/>trade barriers and restrict trade. The welfare effects of standards can also change when the international <lb/>trade dimension is considered. As noted in the context of national standard setting, mandatory standards <lb/>when implemented in markets for credence goods can increase efficiency and national welfare by <lb/>removing information asymmetries between buyers and sellers of food products. National welfare in the <lb/>standard imposing country will increase in such circumstances if a standard is well designed. However, <lb/>global efficiency and welfare may not necessarily be improved as a consequence of the trade effects of the <lb/>national standard [WTO, 2005]. <lb/>National standards that aim at increasing efficiency can, therefore, have complex effects when the <lb/>trade dimension is taken into account [Henson, 2004]. In the first case, firms facing food quality standards <lb/>in their own markets that differ from those in foreign markets may be placed at a competitive disadvantage <lb/>in selling into foreign markets relative to national firms. This may also apply to quasi-public production <lb/>standards at the farm level. For example, many of the farm-level quality assurance schemes are designed <lb/>and implemented by national producer organisations and it is to their advantage to use the system to <lb/>differentiate national production in a positive way from competing imports [Holleran et al., 1999]. By the <lb/>same token, standards can also work against the interests of exporters in standard setting countries. If a <lb/>country introducing a standard is an exporting country, trade is unlikely to increase. To the extent that <lb/>production costs are larger for higher quality foods, domestic exporters, unless they are able to differentiate <lb/>their products and secure a return for higher quality, will then become less competitive in world markets <lb/>where their foreign competitors are not required to meet the same quality standards [WTO, 2005]. <lb/>International trade agreements are another influence changing the contours of public and private <lb/>control systems [Henson and Caswell, 1999]. It is in the area of government mandated product and process <lb/>standards where the greatest concern exists about possible adverse effects on trade [WTO, 2005]. As tariffs <lb/>and other traditional tools for managing imports and controlling market access are reduced under <lb/>progressive trade agreements, there remains the temptation to use sanitary and phyto-sanitary as well as <lb/>technical quality food regulations as non-tariff barriers to fill the void to protect domestic producers. As a <lb/>result, national food regulatory control systems are coming under increasing scrutiny as potential non-tariff <lb/>barriers to trade, and governments are collectively pursuing efforts towards multilateral coordination of <lb/>regulatory activities [Henson, 2004]. In the international sphere, attempts have been made to overcome the <lb/>potential negative trade effects of food quality standards. The World Trade Organization (WTO) through <lb/>the Agreements on Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) measures and on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) <lb/>has played an important role in this respect. These agreements represent the most comprehensive attempt <lb/>to address the impact of food standards on trade and have lead to the implementation of certain types of <lb/>national standards becoming more transparent. As a result of these agreements, countries now have a <lb/>formal responsibility and some incentives to attend to the trade impacts of their regulatory programmes <lb/>[Caswell and Henson, 1999]. WTO members that develop new standards or technical regulations that are <lb/>10 <lb/>Although processes are typically not traded, the goods they produce may be traded and therefore processes are <lb/>important for trade. The relevance of unincorporated PPMs for trade policy is less straightforward as they do not <lb/>directly affect anything that is traded. However, consumers or governments in an importing country may care about the <lb/>way an imported good is produced because, for example, they care about the environmental impact of the production <lb/>process (e.g. the case of US shrimps). Labour standards share many characteristics with process standards. <lb/></body>

			<body>not based on international standards are required to notify the measures prior to implementation under the <lb/>terms of the SPS and TBT Agreements. The growth in these notifications also provides evidence of the <lb/>increased number and incidence of public standards. <lb/>International rules for the regulation of agricultural product and food attributes are primarily dealt <lb/>with in the SPS and TBT Agreements that were concluded in 1994. The SPS Agreement has established <lb/>specific disciplines for the regulation of food safety attributes; the GATT/WTO and the TBT Agreement <lb/>has revised rules for the regulation of other food quality attributes. The TBT Agreement covers technical <lb/>regulations, standards, including packaging, marking and labelling and conformity assessment procedures. <lb/>In the agro-food sector, the TBT Agreement applies to all rules other than those relating to animal, plant <lb/>and human life and health which are the focus of the SPS Agreement. Food quality issues such as nutrition <lb/>labelling are covered by the TBT Agreement. Another trade accord, the Agreement on Trade Related <lb/>Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) includes provisions protecting the use of geographical <lb/>indications that are used to differentiate agricultural and food products in the market place. After 1994, the <lb/>World Trade Organization became the court of last resort when member countries dispute trade barriers <lb/>related to SPS and TBT matters 11 [Kinsey, 2004]. <lb/>The SPS agreement defines guiding principles that aim to minimise the trade distorting effects of food <lb/>standards that apply to health and outlines procedures for the resolution of disagreements between <lb/>countries over these standards. There are two approaches through which national food standards can be <lb/>justified within the Agreement. Firstly, through the adoption of international standards which are <lb/>automatically assumed to be consistent with the provisions of the Agreement(s); and secondly, through an <lb/>assessment of the risks to human (as well as plant and animal) health addressed by the food regulation. In <lb/>addition, the agreement establishes a number of criteria which national regulations must satisfy, either <lb/>where no international standard exists, or where a state wishes to deviate from or go beyond an <lb/>international standard. Risk assessment is a key element of the disciplines laid down by the SPS <lb/>Agreement to assess different standards. The SPS agreement has important implications for food regulation <lb/>at the national level. Essentially it constrains the activities of regulatory agencies, requiring them to adopt <lb/>only food quality controls that can be scientifically justified and which have the least impact on trade 12 . <lb/>The WTO agreements impose wide-ranging procedural requirements such as notification and consultation <lb/>obligations and transparency obligations. The latter goes beyond allowing sufficient time for other <lb/>governments to comment on regulations and for consultation to take place, and require the establishment of <lb/>enquiry points to answer questions and receive comments from persons in other states. The TBT also lays <lb/>down criteria for conformity assessment procedures (as does the SPS Agreement on control and inspection <lb/>procedures) to ensure that the requirements of the standard are fulfilled. However, it is evident from <lb/>disputes lodged with the WTO that governments face domestic pressures for regulations that do not satisfy <lb/>all these requirements [Kinsey, 2004]. <lb/>An initial assessment of disputes examined by the WTO Appellate body under these different <lb/>agreements suggests that the SPS Agreement has been more successful in resolving differences over <lb/>animal and plant regulations than in resolving disputes over food safety related measures, particularly in <lb/>11 <lb/>The TBT Agreement has a wider coverage than the SPS Agreement in the domain of food quality standards. The SPS <lb/>Agreement covers all measure whose purpose is to protect human and animal health from food borne risks, to protect <lb/>human health from animal and plant carried diseases; to protect animals and plants from pests or disease or to prevent <lb/>or limit damage to a country from the entry, establishment or spread of pests. The TBT Agreement covers all technical <lb/>regulations, voluntary standards and conformity assessment procedures to ensure that these are met. In general, it is the <lb/>type of measure that determines coverage of the TBT Agreement, but the purpose of the measure which is relevant in <lb/>determining whether it is subject to the SPS Agreement [WTO, p 145]. <lb/></body>

			<body>relation to the risk management principles [IATRC, 2001]. The impact of the TBT Agreement on the <lb/>regulation of other quality attributes of agricultural products is more difficult to ascertain in the absence of <lb/>a similar body of dispute panel reports that have been decided on the basis of the agreement. The use of <lb/>panels to settle disputes under the TBT Agreement appears to remain the exception rather than the rule. <lb/>The IATRC study noted that despite some uncertainties about the rules to be applied for these other food <lb/>attributes, there is nonetheless substantial evidence of increased interest on the part of countries in quality <lb/>standards and labelling to achieve a wide array of objectives. Furthermore, it notes that most of the <lb/>regulatory effort in this sphere of activity is being directed at consumer concerns on the basis of increasing <lb/>acceptance of the principle of their right to know and to improve transparency. As labelling is expected to <lb/>be more widely used for a greater range of purposes in coming years, the TBT Agreement is considered to <lb/>likely play a larger role in setting the rules for international trade in food products [IATRC, 2001]. These <lb/>developments, together with increasing international surveillance of national measures, would suggest that <lb/>direct regulatory standards can be expected to become increasingly global in terms of the criteria that are <lb/>applied and the mechanisms used to ensure that standards are met [Henson and Caswell, 1999]. <lb/>In an attempt to reduce the trade distorting effects of diverse national food quality standards, <lb/>governments are also seeking to co-operate in their regulatory efforts. This has been termed &quot; regulatory <lb/>rapprochement &quot; [Caswell and Hooker, 1996; Hooker and Caswell, 1999]. It is possible to identify three <lb/>levels of regulatory rapprochement that vary with the level of co-operation, namely co-ordination, <lb/>equivalence or mutual recognition, and harmonisation. Co-ordination refers to attempts to minimise <lb/>differences in food quality regulations between countries, for example, through adoption of voluntary <lb/>international codes of practice. The equivalence or mutual recognition principle involves the acceptance of <lb/>different forms of food quality standards amongst countries as being equivalent. Finally, harmonisation of <lb/>standards involves the standardisation of food quality regulations between countries, for example through <lb/>the adoption of international standards. A common international standard has the potential to facilitate <lb/>trade across borders by making products more substitutable, increasing consumer confidence in product <lb/>characteristics, ensuring compatibility between products and so forth [Henson and Caswell, 1999]. To the <lb/>extent that different national standards have segmented domestic from foreign markets, harmonisation is <lb/>expected to lead to increased trade and competition, lower prices and enhanced quality [WTO, 2005]. <lb/>The different principles of regulatory rapprochement, however, are not always exactly coinciding. In <lb/>some cases harmonisation, rather than equivalence, is the guiding principle. In others the reverse may be <lb/>true. Hooker and Caswell [1995] in their earlier review suggest that the type of product or attribute should <lb/>be an important factor in determining the guiding principle used under the WTO and that one should <lb/>expect harmonisation for food safety standards and mutual recognition for food quality standards. The case <lb/>in favour of harmonisation of standards, however, is relatively weak when it comes to standards addressing <lb/>information asymmetries. To the extent that countries differ it may be preferable to have different policies <lb/>rather than one single policy [WTO, 2005]. While some progress has been made under these WTO <lb/>agreements in addressing the trade effects of food quality attributes, countries have resisted substantial <lb/>recognition of equivalence between national regulatory regimes as a basis for ensuring national treatment, <lb/>and harmonisation of standards has not been overly effective to date in defining uniform standards <lb/>multilaterally [IATRC, 2001; Henson, 2004]. <lb/>F.ii <lb/>Private standards and trade <lb/>Voluntary private standards in addition to public regulations are also increasingly recognised as <lb/>having a potential trade impact. As private quality standards often go well beyond basic regulatory <lb/>requirements, they can impose significant costs of compliance on food suppliers and exporters. Such costs <lb/>can arise from fixed investments in adjusting production and processing facilities, personnel and <lb/>management costs to implement the standard and associated control systems and the costs of conformity <lb/>assessment. These costs are likely to be greater for exporters in countries where public and private <lb/></body>

			<body>standards are less well developed [Jaffee and Henson, 2004]. As voluntary standards can differ across <lb/>countries they can raise an effective barrier to trade or participation in exchange to those firms, groups or <lb/>farmers which are unable to meet the supply standard [Fulponi, 2006]. Another concern with the growth of <lb/>private standards in a trade context is their impact on the transparency of regulatory processes. Although <lb/>the WTO commits member states to notify all new public food quality standards and to provide <lb/>opportunities for trade partners to raise their concerns and engage in dialogue, this does not apply to <lb/>private standards [Henson, 2004]. However, in the promulgation of collective private standards, many <lb/>stakeholders along the supply chain are normally involved, including from different countries. This might <lb/>suggest that such standards are also open to influence by a wide range of stakeholders including trading <lb/>partners [Jaffee and Henson, 2005]. Nevertheless, the growth in private collective standards by global food <lb/>businesses does raise the issue of the implications for the WTO and SPS and TBT Agreements and whether <lb/>these standards fall within the ambit of the rights and obligation specified in these agreements [Jaffee and <lb/>Henson, 2005]. For example, the SPS Committee of the WTO focuses its work on standards developed by <lb/>members which represent participating governments, whereas private standards are essentially developed <lb/>by commercial entities and this limits the Committee&apos;s ability to address many of these requirements. 13 <lb/>Much of the debate on the impact of more stringent private standards on trade has focussed on <lb/>developing countries and the risks they face in exclusion from buyer-driven supply chains in gaining <lb/>access to developed countries&apos; markets [Jaffee and Henson, 2004; World Bank, 2005; Fulponi, 2006]. <lb/>These standards are perceived as barriers either because the developing countries lack the technical and <lb/>administrative capacities and resources for compliance or because the standards can be applied in a <lb/>discriminatory or protectionist way. To date, analysis of the trade impacts of food quality standards has <lb/>focussed largely on public measures and predominately regulatory approaches. While empirical research <lb/>has demonstrated that public food quality standards can act as significant barriers to trade in agricultural <lb/>and food products, this would suggest that private standards might have similar effects, although there is <lb/>no comparable body of empirical literature. To the contrary, the trend towards collective private standards <lb/>and their harmonisation across global markets, suggests that these might act to facilitate trade. In weighing <lb/>up the competing trade reduction and creation effects of private standards, however, it needs to be <lb/>acknowledged that in many agricultural and food product markets, such as bulk grains and fruits and <lb/>vegetables and so on, public standards remain the dominant form of governance. In these cases, B2B and <lb/>collective private standards are unlikely to be a major impediment to this trade [Jaffee and Henson, 2004]. <lb/>Furthermore, as noted previously, there are many countries in the world where private standards are less <lb/>evolved, such as Japan, and public standards remain the dominant influence on trade. <lb/>An alternative perspective to the traditional standards as barriers argument is that of standards as <lb/>catalysts to increase trade. Emerging standards offer the possibility that certain developing countries could <lb/>use these opportunities to improve their competitive advantage. From this viewpoint, the emerging <lb/>standards represent a potential bridge between increasingly demanding consumer requirements and the <lb/>participation of developing country suppliers in buyer-driven supply chains. Investing in new procedures to <lb/>comply with higher food standards of such buyers may provide a powerful incentive for the modernisation <lb/>of developing countries&apos; export supply chains and enable them to reposition themselves in competitive <lb/>global markets. Compliance with standards in one supply chain may provide access to multiple chains, in <lb/>particular, where collective standards are in place. Hence the process of standards compliance could <lb/>conceivably provide the basis for more sustainable and profitable trade over the longer term. The foregoing <lb/>discussion suggests a more complex reality in which close attention is needed to the specifics of particular <lb/>markets, products and countries to understand how the changing international standards environment is <lb/>providing both challenges and opportunities for developing countries. <lb/>13 <lb/>The TBT Agreement, on the other hand, establishes the possibility of the preparation, adoption and <lb/>application of technical regulations by Non-Governmental bodies. <lb/></body>

			<body>Barriers to trade arising from private standards can also be removed through harmonisation or mutual <lb/>recognition. International harmonisation of voluntary standards can take place through inter-governmental <lb/>treaties but is more likely through standard sharing coalitions of firms and industry consortia. These are <lb/>usually designed to avoid or minimise wasteful duplication of compliance costs that result from multiple <lb/>national standards and to exploit economies of scale at a more disaggregated level of economic activity <lb/>[Casella, 2001]. Pressures to harmonise and rationalise voluntary food standards across countries and <lb/>systems of conformity assessment, can be expected to become more important as food companies continue <lb/>to expand across the world and develop global supply chains [Casella, 2001]. At the same time, it is <lb/>important to recognise that public standards still matter in the context of business to business arrangements <lb/>and global food chains. In addition to satisfying private voluntary standards, exporters to a country need to <lb/>comply with public regulatory requirements before gaining access to that country&apos;s market. <lb/>F.iii <lb/>Standards and the multilateral trading system <lb/>One intention of the Uruguay Round Agreement was to bring national food policies regulations into <lb/>closer harmonisation by adopting and strengthening the language of the Codex Alimentarius. Although the <lb/>Codex Alimentarius Commission sets the benchmark international standards for food quality and safety <lb/>that form the guidelines used by the WTO in assessing trade restrictions, individual countries continue to <lb/>regulate the quality of the food available to their consumers. In such circumstances, Codex is seen as a first <lb/>step to harmonisation of world food standards [Kinsey, 2004]. In addition to the Codex, the United Nations <lb/>Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) standards are internationally recognised benchmarks, are <lb/>more oriented towards quality issues and are commonly used as the basis for many national grades and <lb/>standards. OECD standards for seeds, forestry reproduction material and fruit and vegetables are also an <lb/>important component of this intergovernmental standards network. <lb/>A number of difficulties have been identified in the literature for the Codex Commission in <lb/>discharging this function. For example, the goals established in the SPS Agreement of basing food <lb/>regulations on scientific evidence (as opposed to social need), while allowing countries to set standards <lb/>higher than those called for by international regulations in recognition of cultural, dietary and other <lb/>national differences, might suggest that they could be subverted by national interests [Gaull and Goldberg, <lb/>1993]. A second potential problem that has been identified in the literature is that scientific expertise and <lb/>resources vary greatly among Codex member nations. This tends to give an advantage to developed <lb/>countries over developing nations in setting standards. Codex deliberations in reaching a consensus on a <lb/>multinational food standard amongst its membership can at times be a long and drawn out affair [Kinsey, <lb/>2004]. 14 Despite these experiences, Codex has helped raise food quality standards around the world making <lb/>it essential to human health and food trade. <lb/>The standards development process organised by national, supra-national/regional and international <lb/>standards institutions has evolved over time. The national standardisation infrastructure in most <lb/>industrialised countries is now integrated into the network of international standardisation activities. <lb/>However not all low income or transition economies have followed this trend as their national institutions <lb/>are not part of the international network [WTO, 2005]. Of the 49 international standardising bodies <lb/>identified by a recent WTO study [2005], the International Organisation of Standardization (ISO), is the <lb/>most important non-government body with respect to food quality issues. Standards set by the ISO are <lb/>voluntary, but some are referred to in technical regulations particularly in regard to health and safety as <lb/>part of national regulatory frameworks and, thus, have become de facto mandatory in application. ISO <lb/>standards such as ISO 9000 on quality management systems tend to have more focus on the specific <lb/>14 <lb/>Kinsey, in her analysis of Codex procedures for setting standards, cites the example of the protracted deliberations and <lb/>processes undertaken by the Commission since 1974 to elaborate a standard on &apos;parmesan &quot; cheese. In other cases such <lb/>as for &quot; yoghurt &quot; , Codex standards have been set with relative ease. <lb/></body>

			<body>concerns of industry with greater participation of the private sector. ISO standards continue to evolve, with <lb/>ISO 22000 establishing for the first time a global standard for food quality management systems that <lb/>encompasses the entire supply chain from production through to distribution that is well beyond the scope <lb/>of most private standards. How this new standard will impact on the future evolution of private standards <lb/>is yet to be seen. Certification of ISO standards is also increasingly becoming a requirement of many <lb/>national systems of public process standards. These must also comply with international norms and the <lb/>testing and certification procedures in such cases need to be recognised internationally. <lb/>Many developing countries are increasingly being integrated into the international standardisation <lb/>system. However, a considerable number of low income countries are still not actively participating in this <lb/>process, although they continue to be affected by it [WTO, 2005]. The implementation of food standards <lb/>and regulations involve costs and potentially important costs for developing countries when commitments <lb/>are bound in negotiated trade agreements. Some of these costs arise from the normal requirements for <lb/>testing and certification (conformity assessment) procedures necessary to determine if a food product <lb/>meets standardised requirements justified by scientific risk. However, cost duplication can also arise for <lb/>developing countries in determining conformity to varying national technical regulations for gaining <lb/>market access for example to the different Member State markets in the European Union. <lb/>Standards institutions in poorer countries are generally located in the public sector with limited <lb/>participation of the private sector. 15 While food quality standards may exist on the rule book and be well <lb/>documented in such countries, a particular problem arises with respect to the enforcement of existing <lb/>standards due to limited public, financial and technical resources for these activities. Where there is <lb/>insufficient capacity to implement and enforce even basic food standards, private voluntary standards and <lb/>associated management and verification processes of food businesses can provide a useful parallel <lb/>mechanism to raise standards to provide protection for consumers [Henson, 2004]. While this leads to an <lb/>improvement in food quality and a degree of uniformity across countries in which particular multinational <lb/>firms operate, there is a risk that such standards may not fully reflect the cultures and preferences of the <lb/>developing countries concerned [WTO, 2005]. In cases where private standards developed by globally <lb/>operating firms fail to take adequate account of local conditions and cultures, the costs of compliance can <lb/>be greater than for standards produced locally [Henson, 2004; WTO, 2005]. While there remains the risk of <lb/>market exclusion with high private standards when applied to developing country exporters, with perhaps <lb/>significant trade reduction and diversion effects, the impacts on agricultural and food product trade are <lb/>likely to be complex [Henson, 2004]. As noted, rising private standards can also serve to accentuate <lb/>underlying supply chain strengths and weaknesses and thus impact differently on the competitive position <lb/>of individual developing countries [WTO, 2005]. For those exporters who do gain access to buyer-driven <lb/>supply chains, the benefits in terms of long term trade relations through participating in systems of <lb/>preferred suppliers can also be very large. <lb/>G. <lb/>Some conclusions and areas for future research <lb/>The foregoing would suggest that the relations between public and private sectors in the establishment <lb/>and development of food quality standards are becoming increasingly complex as the numbers of both <lb/>types of standards proliferate and become generally more stringent and varied in their applications in both <lb/>national and international food markets. Private standards are, however a fairly recent phenomenon and are <lb/>still far from universally applied across the world, with public standards remaining the dominant influence <lb/>on some national food markets. <lb/></body>

			<body>The interaction of private and public standards in the food system is an area of research that has only <lb/>recently begun to receive some attention. The existing research would suggest that by and large, private <lb/>standards are considered to be complementary to, rather than a substitute for, public norms in governing <lb/>food quality in most national food systems where they are both present. The public standards or norms <lb/>establish the minimum quality requirements for food products and the results to be achieved, while private <lb/>standards elaborate the tools and control processes followed by private firms in meeting and often <lb/>exceeding these standards and regulatory obligations in competing in quality differentiated markets <lb/>[Henson, 2006]. Private standards can also act as a substitute for missing or ineffective public regulations <lb/>[Reardon et al. 2001; Henson and Reardon, 2005]. This has reportedly been the situation in some least <lb/>developed countries in the past where private standards developed by some multinational food retailers for <lb/>their home markets have been applied also in less developed countries to the advantage of local consumers <lb/>[Reardon and Berdegeue, 2002]. <lb/>In most cases, private firms in seeking to differentiate their products, achieve market segmentation <lb/>and to signal such changes to consumers to distinguish them from the more generic food items that meet <lb/>the public standards, have built their private standards on the existing public standards infrastructure. That <lb/>is, they follow a strategy of private differentiation from a public minimum quality standard [Codron et al., <lb/>2005]. The level of standards formulated and enforced by governments influence the level of the private <lb/>standards. As public standards become more stringent this can lead to a higher level of private standards to <lb/>maintain a degree of product differentiation and competitive positioning in food markets. <lb/>The distinction between public and private standards has become less clear cut as the complexity of <lb/>standards has increased over time. In general, private standards have been developed as a means to comply <lb/>with public regulatory requirements. However, there are also instances of government regulations adopting <lb/>the mechanisms employed by private voluntary standards, such as HACCP provisions, and referencing <lb/>private standards in their rules. Private standards may even develop when public regulations already <lb/>provide a high level of food quality in order to pre-empt additional regulatory measures [Lutz et al., 2000]. <lb/>In his way, private standards may play a role in shaping the content and level of the public regulation. <lb/>The complexity of the interaction of incentives provided by public and private quality standards is <lb/>considerably increased in the context of international trade. While there has been only limited empirical <lb/>analysis of the trade impacts of food quality standards, this has shown that they can play a contrasting role <lb/>in both reducing and enhancing trade in agricultural and food products. However, it is also evident that <lb/>private standards are becoming a primary determinant of market access in some industrial countries and <lb/>that these fall outside the governance structures established by the WTO and the role of the SPS and TBT <lb/>Agreements [Henson, 2006]. <lb/>In judging the standards system as a whole, there remain many situations where inefficiencies can still <lb/>arise for market participants in responding to a mix of standards that can reduce overall system coherence <lb/>and efficacy [Valceschini and Saulais, 2005]. These mainly arise in the case of private proprietary <lb/>standards of individual food retailers, and food service companies where standards are not based on any <lb/>sectoral consensus process. Each firm implements its own private voluntary standards, which while similar <lb/>are not necessarily identical and can establish different requirements for supplying firms usually on the <lb/>basis of contractual arrangements. This diversity can imply higher transaction costs and inefficiencies for <lb/>food supplying firms that need to conform to different buyer driven standards in food supply chains. This <lb/>type of problem can also arise for private buying firms operating proprietary standards across national <lb/>borders and subject to various national or international food quality and safety regulations that may have <lb/>different stipulations (e.g. HACCP requirements excluded in France for non-transformed agricultural <lb/>products but required for them under the Codex Alimentarius). Collective private protocols and <lb/>international food system standards (such as ISO 22000] are possible solutions to improve the overall <lb/>coherence of the system of food standards, but are not always available or systematically adopted. <lb/></body>

			<body>The foregoing synthesis of the available literature on public and private food standards would suggest <lb/>that research on how these standards interact in regulating national and international food markets is a <lb/>relatively new area of work but one that is receiving increasing attention. It is apparent that differences <lb/>exist between OECD member countries in how the systems of food standards are evolving, and the <lb/>respective roles played by private and public agencies in this process. Future research could focus on <lb/>comparing the situation in the main countries for food quality management and the different roles played <lb/>by public and private sectors in key aspects of the process such as, for example, for product quality <lb/>certification and conformity testing requirements. The objective would be to identify similarities and <lb/>differences in approach and to highlight the reasons for and the main factors involved. <lb/></body>
