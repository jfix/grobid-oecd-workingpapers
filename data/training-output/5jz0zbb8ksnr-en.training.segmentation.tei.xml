The resurgence in oil and gas production is beginning to create discernible <lb/>economic impacts and has changed the landscape for natural gas prices in the United States, boosting <lb/>competitiveness. In order to reap the benefits fully, significant investment is needed. Federal and state <lb/>governments capture some of the resource rents, but there are potential opportunities to increase taxation <lb/>and use the revenues to support future well-being. Taxing natural resource rents with profit taxes can be <lb/>less distortionary than other forms of taxation, though only one state uses this form of tax. Production of <lb/>shale resources, like other forms of resource extraction, poses a number of challenges for the environment. <lb/>Respecting demands on water resources requires adequate water rights are in place while state and federal <lb/>regulators need to monitor the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing closely and strengthen <lb/>regulations as needed. Natural gas is a potential &quot; bridge fuel &quot; towards a lower carbon economy, helping to <lb/>reduce emissions by leading to a substitution away from coal. Flanking measures are desirable to counter <lb/>natural gas hindering renewables and low prices stymieing innovation. <lb/>This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of United States <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-states.htm). <lb/>JEL classification codes: H25; Q33; Q35; Q4; Q53; Q58 <lb/>Keywords: resource taxation, resource booms, hydrocarbon resources, energy, air and water pollution, <lb/>government policy <lb/>************************************* <lb/>Capital naturel aux États-Unis <lb/>Les États-Unis possèdent un riche capital naturel. Depuis 2007 environ, le pays connaît une <lb/>« renaissance énergétique » grâce à ses abondantes réserves de pétrole et de gaz de schiste. Le nouvel essor <lb/>de la production pétrolière et gazière commence à avoir des effets économiques perceptibles et a changé la <lb/>situation des prix de l&apos;énergie aux États-Unis, stimulant la compétitivité. Pour tirer pleinement parti de <lb/>cette évolution, il faudra des investissements significatifs. Le gouvernement fédéral et les États devraient <lb/>capter une partie de la rente des ressources naturelles et mettre ces recettes au service de l&apos;amélioration du <lb/>bien-être futur. Alors que la taxation des rentes de ressources via l&apos;impôt sur les bénéfices peut être moins <lb/>distorsive que d&apos;autres formes de fiscalité, seul un État y a recours. La production de pétrole et de gaz de <lb/>schiste s&apos;accompagne d&apos;un certain nombre de défis environnementaux. Pour respecter les demandes <lb/>d&apos;utilisation des ressources en eau, il faut veiller à l&apos;existence de droits sur l&apos;eau appropriés, et les autorités <lb/>chargées de la réglementation au niveau fédéral et à celui des États doivent surveiller de près les <lb/>répercussions environnementales de la fracturation hydraulique et renforcer la réglementation autant que <lb/>nécessaire. Le gaz naturel peut être une « énergie relais » dans la transition vers une économie sobre en <lb/>carbone et contribuer à réduire les émissions en entraînant le remplacement du charbon. En l&apos;absence <lb/>d&apos;une action concertée, il y a toutefois un risque que le marché de l&apos;énergie se reporte de nouveau sur le <lb/>charbon en cas d&apos;épuisement des réserves de gaz naturel ou de modification des prix relatifs. Des mesures <lb/>d&apos;accompagnement seraient souhaitables pour éviter que le gaz naturel freine le développement des <lb/>énergies renouvelables et que la faiblesse des prix paralyse l&apos;innovation. <lb/>Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l&apos;Étude économique de l&apos;OCDE de États-Unis 2014 <lb/>(www.oecd.org/eco/etudes/etats-unis.htm). <lb/>Classification JEL : H25; Q33; Q35; Q4; Q53; Q58 <lb/>Mots-clés : impôts sur les ressources, le boom des ressources, ressources en hydrocarbures, énergie, <lb/>pollution de l&apos;air et de l&apos;eau, politiques publiques <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)43 <lb/></front>

			<body>MAKING THE BEST OF NEW ENERGY RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES <lb/>by Douglas Sutherland 1 <lb/>The United States is endowed with an abundance of natural capital -the natural resource inputs and <lb/>environmental services for economic production -and economic growth has been punctuated by periods of <lb/>their rapid exploitation, such as for gold and other metal ores, minerals and coal, oil and gas. Since around <lb/>2007, the country has been enjoying an &quot; energy renaissance &quot; thanks to its abundant stocks of shale oil and <lb/>gas being made accessible by the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies. <lb/>The renaissance has revived production of oil and natural gas and is creating economic benefits. At the <lb/>same time, exploiting natural capital raises issues about how to make sure that the environmental impacts <lb/>and safety concerns are taken into consideration (i.e. internalise associated environmental externalities) and <lb/>ensure that longer-term sustainability, both of wealth and the environment, is taken into consideration. This <lb/>chapter, examining the recent upswing in oil and gas production, considers the policies that help capture <lb/>the full economic and environmental benefits while addressing externalities and longer-term sustainability. <lb/>The next section describes the resource endowment in the United States and how shale oil and gas <lb/>have changed the picture for the energy sector. The next section discusses the economic benefits which <lb/>may emerge as a result of increased oil and gas production. The following section assesses how the rents <lb/>from the sector are being distributed and how taxation of the sector is implemented. This is followed by a <lb/>discussion of the local impacts of hydraulic fracturing and the regulatory challenge they create. The final <lb/>section then discusses the contribution natural gas could make to climate change mitigation and the <lb/>challenges it may pose moving towards an even lower carbon economy. <lb/>The United States is well endowed with natural resources <lb/>Natural capital represents a relatively small share of the overall wealth in the United States, which is <lb/>dominated by intangibles or human (and health) capital (Arrow et al.2012). However, on a per capita basis, <lb/>calculations for the early 2000s still rank the United States 11 th in the world according to the abundance of <lb/>natural capital and 15th in respect to sub-soil mineral resources (World Bank, 2006). Only a few OECD <lb/>countries have large shares of natural resources as a share of total wealth, which in the case of Norway <lb/>arises due to their ample off-shore hydrocarbon reserves. Japan, on the other hand, has very few natural <lb/>resources and its wealth is derived from human capital and produced (physical) capital. <lb/></body>

			<body>Following the successful deployment of new technologies for advanced drilling, the Energy <lb/>Information Administration markedly increased its estimates of oil and gas reserves (Figure 2.1). Shale gas <lb/>proved reserves -those reserves with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under <lb/>existing economic and operating conditions -have risen more than fivefold between 2007 and 2011 and <lb/>now account for 40% of total gas reserves in the United States. In the case of oil, shale oil (often referred to <lb/>as &quot; tight oil &quot; ) proved reserves have also risen, though less spectacularly, and these deposits now account <lb/>for around 10% of total oil proved reserves. Forecasts suggest that production of shale gas will continue to <lb/>grow strongly till at least 2040 when it will account for one half of natural gas produced in the <lb/>United States (EIA, 2013). President Obama in his 2012 State of the Union address noted that recoverable <lb/>resources may last as long as 100 years at current production levels. At present, not all recoverable <lb/>resources would be commercially viable to extract, but in the longer term as energy prices rise and/or <lb/>technological innovation reduce extraction costs a greater share of these resources could be extracted. The <lb/>picture for production of shale oil is similar, but with total oil production peaking before 2030 and then <lb/>declining. <lb/>Natural capital in the United States has been boosted by rises in estimates of proved reserves of shale <lb/>oil and shale gas. Using a methodology developed by the World Bank to estimate natural wealth gives <lb/>some indication of the potential changes arising from these developments. By this measure, oil and gas <lb/>wealth in the United States grew from around 16% of GNI in 2000 to over 30% of GNI in 2008, just when <lb/>the shale boom was beginning to take off (Table 1). Assuming the boost to reserves extends the resource <lb/>life, the expansion of shale oil and shale oil production could lift wealth derived from oil and gas <lb/>substantially. While more recent information on production costs is unavailable, using the latest available <lb/>figure to estimate the rents suggests that the natural wealth due to gas has fallen somewhat, partly as a <lb/>result of the falling natural gas prices in the United States (see below), whereas the wealth due to crude oil <lb/>rose further. <lb/>The impact of shale oil and gas development has seen the gradual fall in crude oil production reversed <lb/>and the production of natural gas pick up. Between 2008 -when production hit its recent low -and 2013 <lb/>crude oil production has surged, rising by almost 50%. Over the same period, the production of natural gas <lb/>has risen almost 20%, with shale gas production more than tripling and offsetting declines in conventional <lb/>natural gas production from other sources. <lb/>Figure 1.

This methodology makes a number <lb/>of simplifying assumptions to calculate the resource rent. These include setting the assumed resource life of the deposit and <lb/>estimating of production costs for oil and gas. The calculation of wealth is then based on these parameters and production <lb/>levels. The table in the first two columns reproduces the estimates of oil and gas wealth for 2000 and 2008 using this <lb/>methodology. In order to explore the possible impact of more abundant oil and gas resources, the third column reports <lb/>estimates of wealth when the assumed resource life if doubled. The impact of price changes between 2008 and 2012 is <lb/>reported in the fourth column. <lb/>Source: calculations based on World Bank, EIA, Census Bureau and BEA data. <lb/>The oil and gas boom has boosted the fortunes of a number of states and invigorated companies <lb/>working in the sector. The distribution of shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though <lb/>the proved reserves are predominantly located in a handful of states, which is also where large-scale shale <lb/>gas production (these areas are often called &quot; plays &quot; ) is located (Figure 2). The shale oil deposits are <lb/>predominately located in Texas, North and South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and <lb/>Wyoming. Whilst energy stocks have tracked the recovery of stock market indices following the crisis, the <lb/>relatively small scale of hydraulic fracturing wells has led to a substantial inflow of independent companies <lb/>into drilling and supporting services. As a consequence, the major integrated energy companies have had a <lb/>less dominant role in the energy renaissance as it got underway, but have increasingly moved into this area. <lb/>Figure 2.

			<body>Capturing the economic benefits <lb/>Substantial economic benefits are beginning to arise from hydraulic fracturing <lb/>The resurgence in US oil and gas production has already created discernible economic impacts, <lb/>boosting employment in the sector and exports of natural gas and (particularly) refined products (Figure 3). <lb/>Other economic benefits are likely to arise as new production serves as a cushion to price volatility. The <lb/>direct effects of the oil and gas mining sector on growth have been relatively modest, boosting GDP <lb/>growth by on average by around 0.15 percentage points since the pick-up in energy production began in <lb/>2007. However, BEA data on value-added of the oil and gas mining industry show that the sector has <lb/>picked up dramatically in 2011 and 2012 when the real growth rate of value added in the oil and gas <lb/>mining sector rose to 7% and then 18%, accounting for 0.23 and 0.35 percentage points of overall GDP <lb/>growth during these years, respectively. In addition, there are indirect upstream and downstream effects on <lb/>GDP that are not included in these estimates. The boom in shale oil and gas has contributed to strong <lb/>investment in structures in the oil and gas sector, with the growth rate in investment recording double digit <lb/>rates and averaging 18% annual growth between 2010 and 2012. Employment in oil and gas mining <lb/>remains relatively small, but rising strongly during the recovery from the crisis (Figure 3). Including <lb/>support activities in the mining sector suggests that employment has been boosted by 300 000 between the <lb/>nadir in employment in 2003 and 2013. <lb/>Figure 3. The shale boom is boosting employment and net exports <lb/>Source: US Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. <lb/>In the states with the largest shale gas production, the growth rate of the oil and gas mining sector has <lb/>in some cases been spectacular, with Pennsylvania and North Dakota experiencing annual growth rates in <lb/>the sector of over 30%, albeit from low initial levels (Figure 4). The effects are discernible in wage and <lb/>employment developments in some states. The impact of the resource boom is especially apparent on wage <lb/>growth. For example, according to BLS data, average weekly earnings in North Dakota are rising at a 7% <lb/>rate since 2011, compared with the national average of around 2%. BLS data also show that gains in <lb/>mining sector employment have contributed to sizable employment gains in a number of regions. <lb/>A.

Growth in the oil and gas mining sectors is fast in some states <lb/>Average growth rate 2007 to 2011 <lb/>Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis. <lb/>The oil and gas boom has depressed domestic energy prices <lb/>The shale gas and oil boom has changed the landscape for energy prices in the United States. The <lb/>relationships between international oil prices (Brent), domestic oil prices (WTI) and natural gas prices <lb/>(Henry Hub) have weakened, with the tendency for these prices to move together becoming weaker after <lb/>mid-2008, largely coinciding with the largely unanticipated rapid pick up in shale oil and gas production <lb/>(Figure 5). The decoupling of natural gas from prices in Europe and Asia is particularly pronounced. The <lb/>price of natural gas fell to as low as around one-quarter of natural gas prices in Europe and even less in the <lb/>Asian market before rebounding somewhat. The low price of natural gas promoted a switch in exploration <lb/>and production away from shale gas and towards shale oil. Lower domestic natural gas prices have <lb/>supported natural gas exports and are boosting the potential competitiveness for natural gas intensive <lb/>industry by reducing feedstock (mainly ethylene) prices, whereas other sectors benefit from cheaper energy <lb/>prices. Given liquefaction, transportation and regasification costs, the wedge between domestic and <lb/>international natural gas prices is likely to be persistent. Export of natural gas to countries without free-<lb/>trade agreements with the United States requires prior approval from the Department of Energy, for which <lb/>there is an established authorisation process. The Administration should ensure that energy exports are <lb/>promptly approved. Limited export-oriented infrastructure also currently constrains natural gas exports. <lb/>Although more than 9 billion cubic feet per day of export facilities have been granted conditional permits <lb/>from the Department of Energy and roughly 2 billion cubic feet per day have received final permits, LNG <lb/>export facilities are massive and require years to construct. With the prospect of lower domestic energy <lb/>prices, investment in pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, which are undertaken by the private <lb/>sector, will be important to ensure the economy can reap the full benefits. <lb/>-20 <lb/>-10 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>-20 <lb/>-10 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>50 <lb/>Michigan <lb/>Montana <lb/>Kentucky <lb/>New Mexico <lb/>Oklahoma <lb/>West Virginia <lb/>Wyoming <lb/>Texas <lb/>United States <lb/>California <lb/>Colorado <lb/>Louisiana <lb/>Arkansas <lb/>Pennsylvania <lb/>North Dakota <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)43 <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 5. Oil and gas prices have diverged <lb/>1. <lb/>BTU (British Thermal Units) <lb/>Source: Bloomberg and International Energy Agency. <lb/>In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the <lb/>exports of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining <lb/>capacity and transportation infrastructure are insufficient to handle the available supply. The <lb/>Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude oil. Another approach <lb/>would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether. <lb/>Other sectors will benefit from the expansion of hydraulic fracturing through input-output linkages. <lb/>The demand from the development of the shale gas and oil sector to other sectors is likely to be relatively <lb/>weak. On the other hand lower energy costs can raise the competitiveness in energy intensive sectors, <lb/>augmenting the impact of relatively modest growth in unit labour costs (Celasun et al., 2014). The impacts <lb/>on energy-intensive sectors, such as chemicals, are currently limited (Goldman Sachs, 2013). To some <lb/>extent, the lack of a consistent picture in industries most likely to benefit from low domestic energy prices <lb/>is due to their capital-intensive nature. As new capacity takes time to construct the full impact on <lb/>competitiveness will only become apparent over time. That said, recent data suggests that the low domestic <lb/>energy prices are having an impact on exports. For example, Spencer et al. (2014) note that net exports in <lb/>energy-intensive sectors more than doubled in value between 2006 and 2012 to USD 27 billion, though <lb/>still only accounting for a small share of overall trade.

			<body>In order to reap the benefits fully, significant investment is required. This includes investments in <lb/>hydraulic fracturing and drilling itself, pipelines and other transportation infrastructure, reorienting import <lb/>terminals to export terminals and the expansion of energy-intensive industries that are likely to benefit <lb/>from lower prices. Given the significant sunk costs and irreversibility associated with these investments, <lb/>measures that reduce uncertainty support the development of transportation and associated infrastructure. <lb/>In this context, a stable policy regime, including for climate change (see below), acquires some <lb/>importance. As discussed below, the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing is not well understood, <lb/>which creates uncertainty as to the likely regulatory response. In these circumstances, companies may <lb/>adopt a wait-and-see strategy and delay investment while environmental agencies develop their <lb/>regulations. The regulatory approach to the development of natural resources is likely to vary considerably <lb/>across states, covering environmental standards as well as permitting and licensing. Rahm (2011) notes <lb/>that the development of mineral rights in some states, such as Texas, is comparatively straightforward <lb/>whereas in others areas, such as New York state and a number of localities, development is explicitly <lb/>prohibited. The federal authorities become important regulators when resource development requires <lb/>interstate transport, with pipelines requiring the approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory <lb/>Commission. <lb/>Who is capturing the benefits? <lb/>The boom in oil and gas production is having significant effects in the states were the deposits are <lb/>located. This raises two related issues. The first concerns how the gains from oil and gas exploitation are <lb/>shared. The second is what happens after the oil and gas deposits are exhausted. In this context, <lb/>governments by capturing some of the resource rent can address how to adjust once the resource boom has <lb/>run its course. This could take the form of investing in education, including community colleges to help <lb/>workers become more adaptable, funding research, financing productive infrastructure provision and <lb/>establishing endowment funds and putting government finances on a better footing by paying down debt. <lb/>In some senses, due to the fungibility of money, ensuring that policy avoids squandering the revenues is <lb/>key to securing longer-term welfare. <lb/>Natural resources confer natural rents, which is roughly the difference between the price at which the <lb/>resource can be sold less the costs of exploitation and extraction or more formally the opportunity cost of <lb/>holding the resource underground. Policy settings are important in determining which groups benefit most <lb/>from the exploitation of natural resources, including future generations who stand to lose unless provisions <lb/>ensure they also benefit. <lb/>In competitive markets, the benefits of resource exploitation are shared among several parties. First, <lb/>landowners benefit from owning the mineral rights through lease payments for their exploitation. Second, <lb/>new gas and oil production has pushed down energy prices, particularly gas prices, benefitting consumers. <lb/>In the oil sector, legal restrictions on crude oil exports in place since the 1970s do not prevent the exports <lb/>of refined petroleum products. However, foreign sales may be limited to the extent that refining capacity <lb/>and transportation infrastructure is insufficient to handle the available supply. For example, some refiners <lb/>are better adapted to using heavier crude oil than the light oil typically produced by hydraulic fracturing. In <lb/>this case, some of the possible resource rent obtainable for oil producers though exporting would be <lb/>sacrificed were domestic light oil production to rise to the point where it exceeds domestic refiners&apos; ability <lb/>to easily absorb it. The Administration is considering options under current law to allow exports of crude <lb/>oil. Another approach would be to abolish the prohibition of crude oil exports altogether. <lb/>Taxation of shale oil and gas <lb/>Federal and state governments may capture some of the resource rent through various taxes and use <lb/>the revenues to support spending or funds that will raise future well-being. Taxing natural resource rents, if <lb/></body>

			<body>done properly, can be less distortionary than other forms of taxation (Box 1.). A well-designed profit tax <lb/>could reduce economic distortions which can discourage exploration and development. However, most <lb/>governments rely on royalties and the rate applied can be relatively low. A few states have experienced a <lb/>significant increase in revenues from resource related taxation (Table 2) and enjoyed a corresponding boost <lb/>to spending (NASBO, 2013). <lb/>Box 1. Taxation of non-renewable natural resources <lb/>Profits derived from non-renewable resource extraction can be taxed while imposing relatively small distortions <lb/>on the economy (Andrade de Sá and Daubanes, 2014). However, the form of taxation can influence the effort in <lb/>exploration and development. While a number of options exist for taxing resources rents, in the United States, most <lb/>governments rely on royalties (also known as severance taxes). Due to the split between federal and state tax <lb/>authority, combinations state resource taxes and federal corporate income taxation are typical. <lb/>Royalty taxes are based on the amount of oil and gas extracted. While relatively easy to collect they introduce a <lb/>number of distortions. The tax can induce the firm to shut extracting the oil and gas earlier than is socially optimal. <lb/>Secondly, the tax can reduce incentives to invest in exploration, although this can be mitigated partially by offering <lb/>investment subsidies. Broadway and Keen (2008) point out that this may give incentives for state governments to levy <lb/>higher severance tax rates than they otherwise would if the royalties are deductible against federal corporate income <lb/>tax. The range of rates levied across the states suggests that this is not an overriding concern. Profit taxation is <lb/>another approach (implemented in Alaska in combination with a royalty tax), which is intended to capture a share of <lb/>profits arising from the resource rent. In this approach a tax is levied on all real transactions on a cash flow basis. The <lb/>government reimburses the private sector firm for negative cash flows, which are typical in the early stage of a project, <lb/>and retain a share of total revenue when the project is generating a positive cash flow. In practice, governments find it <lb/>hard to compensate a private sector firm contemporaneously and prefer to allow the private company to carry forward <lb/>losses with interest. This form of taxation can potentially capture a large share of the resource rent without distorting <lb/>investment and production decisions. Furthermore, the tax base is likely to differ from the resource rent and will again <lb/>introduce distortions to investment and production decisions, though they are less severe than royalty tax regimes. A <lb/>final approach is through using fixed fees for exploration and auctions for exploration rights to capture some of the <lb/>resource rent. When other forms of taxation are also levied later on the project life, the amount of rent captured will be <lb/>reduced or the fee will discourage investment. <lb/>The taxation of oil and gas resources in the United States varies depending on the ownership of the <lb/>land with the deposit. As the majority is on private land, the federal government has little influence on the <lb/>taxation of these resources other than through the normal application of corporate income taxes, which is <lb/>determined by Congress. When oil and gas deposits are on federal land, taxation on mineral resources is <lb/>implemented by the Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior (ONRR) collects revenues <lb/>when bids for leases are made (bonus bids), rent while the lease is not in production (rental fees) and <lb/>royalties when production starts (royalties). Following criticism from GAO over the low federal <lb/>government take (GAO, 2013), the Department of Interior changed offshore terms (royalty rates set at <lb/>18.75% for some offshore deposits, minimum bids, rental rates), but has not changed the onshore fiscal <lb/>system (royalty rate of 12.5%). For deposit on federal land, the states also get a share of the revenues from <lb/>the royalties. The split is 50-50 between the state and federal governments with the exception of resources <lb/>lying on the outer continental shelf for which the revenue split for littoral state governments is 27% or <lb/>37.5% under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. <lb/>For oil and gas deposits on private or state owned land, there is no consistent tax treatment across the <lb/>states. Taxes on production as a share of the oil and gas sector&apos;s value added ranges from just 7% in <lb/>Arkansas to almost 60% in Alaska (Table 2). Royalty tax revenues accrue totally to the state if the land is <lb/>privately held. Different royalty taxes are in place in 30 states, ranging from 10 cents on the barrel for oil <lb/>in Ohio to 8% of gross value in Kansas. Alaska implements a hybrid system combining a royalty tax and a <lb/>profits tax, which has more desirable properties. Pennsylvania, the third largest producer of shale gas in <lb/>2011, does not levy a specific tax. However, Pennsylvania introduced an unconventional gas well fee in <lb/>2012. If revenues exceed a threshold, surplus revenues will be distributed to localities. At the local level, <lb/></body>

			<body>states may share some of the royalty tax revenue with local governments. In addition, hydraulic fracturing <lb/>rents are taxed through property and/or income taxes. In some cases, property taxes include mineral rights <lb/>in the base. Consistent with the theoretical analysis of royalty taxation, the development of reserves tends <lb/>to be depressed by higher rates of royalty taxation on value added (see Annex). <lb/>Table 2.

Some such as Alaska, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming have <lb/>created severance endowment funds, which inter alia use revenues raised from oil and gas exploitation to <lb/>help finance capital projects and invest in education. For example, West Virginia created a Future Fund, <lb/>capturing 3% of the severance tax to fund infrastructure, education and economic development as well as <lb/>tax relief and cultural preservation.

			<body>interest in bonds financing capital projects also investing in education. Other states have earmarked natural <lb/>resource revenues to support spending that is less likely to benefit future generations. For example, West <lb/>Virginia did not establish a specific mechanism to ensure future generations also benefitted from the <lb/>mining of its substantial coal deposits. Rather revenues were spent annually. As coal mining in the state <lb/>has weakened, the state is facing challenges in adapting to this environment (Williams, 2008). <lb/>Box 2. Natural resources and economic sustainability <lb/>Non-renewable natural resources once (economically) recoverable will be ceteris paribus depleted. As such the <lb/>country&apos;s stock of (natural) wealth is reduced, with the exploitation akin to a process of disinvestment. As such future <lb/>generations are not guaranteed to share in the benefits of these natural resources. This has led some authors, such as <lb/>Hartwick (1977), to recognise that investing the rents captured during the depletion of the exhaustible natural resource <lb/>in (produced) capital can enhance sustainability. That is, not only the current generation enjoy the benefits from <lb/>resource exploitation, but future generations also enjoy raised consumption possibilities. However, the degree to which <lb/>natural and produced capital stocks are substitutable is not always clear cut and in some cases the amount of natural <lb/>capital needs to be preserved above critical levels in order to provide environmental services that may provide life-<lb/>support functions. <lb/>Identifying empirically whether the current patterns of natural resource exploitation is sustainable presents a <lb/>number of difficulties in both the measurement of natural capital and identifying which types of investment will augment <lb/>future generation&apos;s stock of wealth. Standard measures of economic development, such as GDP growth and measures <lb/>of capital stocks generally do not consider the role of environment in production. A number of approaches have taken <lb/>into account the environment. <lb/>•  One approach has been to adjust the standard measure of national savings by the depletion of natural<lb/>resources and the impact on environment. The so-called genuine savings or adjusted net saving assess <lb/>whether the exploitation of natural resources (and environmental externalities) does not subtract from <lb/>economic welfare of future generations (World Bank, 2006). Updated estimates for 2008 suggest that for the <lb/>United States that net savings (gross national savings minus consumption of fixed capital) was negative. <lb/>However, adjusted net saving was positive when taking into account education spending and making <lb/>adjustments for the depletion of energy and mineral resources and environmental damage from carbon <lb/>dioxide emissions and particulate matter. Nonetheless, savings in the United States were comparatively <lb/>small by both measures (Figure 2.6). <lb/></body>

Adjusted national savings (2008) <lb/>As a percentage of GNI <lb/>Source: World Bank. <lb/>•  Related and recent work at the OECD has attempted to take account of the use of certain types of natural<lb/>capital through adjustments to productivity measures (Brandt et al., 2013). This work (covering the period <lb/>1986 to 2008) suggests for the United States that the difference between traditional and adjusted <lb/>productivity measures is not large (Figure 7). However, during this period, oil and gas reserves fell and the <lb/>contribution of natural capital to growth was slightly negative overall. As such, during the period of resource <lb/>depletion, other factors of production needed to increase slightly to maintain similar rates of growth. <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>In a number of cases, governments also collect revenues for conservation and remediation purposes. <lb/>At the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was introduced in 1964 to capture <lb/>some of the rent from the depletion of oil and gas resources on the outer continental shelf to protect other <lb/>natural resources, such as coastal areas, open areas and wildlife habitat. At the state level, a few states levy <lb/>taxes to address oil field clean ups and restoration, including Louisiana and Texas. Several other states levy <lb/>oil and gas conservation fees which are earmarked for capping and reclaiming abandoned wells amongst <lb/>other uses. <lb/>Local impacts <lb/>Hydraulic fracturing has aroused considerable controversy. The environmental and social impact of <lb/>large scale drilling activity across the landscape has provoked significant local opposition in some parts of <lb/>the country. Bans have been imposed in New York State, metropolitan Pittsburgh and a handful of towns <lb/>around the country. However, survey findings reveal respondents are not necessarily opposed to hydraulic <lb/>fracturing, but want assurances that it will be conducted correctly (Krupnick, 2013), implying a role for <lb/>regulatory frameworks in facilitating stakeholder acceptance (IEA, 2012). <lb/>Local externalities <lb/>At the local level, inhabitants experience a number of externalities (Muehlenbachs et al., 2012). Close <lb/>to the well inhabitants face (adjacency) costs associated with noise and light pollution, local air pollution, <lb/>visual dis-amenities (pollution). In addition, there are a number of vicinity effects as people are affected by <lb/>the impact of traffic congestion and road damage as the road pavement in rural areas are often not <lb/>constructed for the heavy vehicles. The major impacts for residents are arguably through the environmental <lb/>externalities created by hydraulic fracturing. There is considerable uncertainty about these effects and the <lb/>science far from settled. The impact on the local environment is not universally negative. The substitution <lb/>of coal and other fuels by natural gas may have effects through reducing other emissions, such as sulphur <lb/>dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and particulate matter. <lb/>Hydraulic fracturing puts stress on water resources… <lb/>Up to 5 million gallons of water are needed for each shale gas hydraulic fracturing well. This demand <lb/>in a relatively short period of time puts stress on local water resources, which is not limited to a problem of <lb/>arid regions. Demands on water resources have mounted and water stress has become a more common <lb/>phenomenon. The rate of extraction of ground water from aquifers has increased over the 20 th century, <lb/>partly driven by land drainage to extend farmland. Since the turn of the 21 st century, the rate of ground <lb/>water depletion has accelerated, such that slightly less than one-fifth of total groundwater depletion since <lb/>1900 occurred in the period 2000-08 (USGS, 2013). While hydraulic fracturing only accounts for a small <lb/>fraction of the demand for water, the localised demand for a short period can create important stresses on <lb/>water resources. For surface water, such demands can threaten the environmental services provided by the <lb/>local ecosystems when water levels or flows drop precipitously. <lb/>Respecting the competing demands on water resources requires adequate water rights are in place, <lb/>while respecting minimum flow requirements for water bodies. Pricing water resources effectively and <lb/>allowing trading may go some way to using limited water resources efficiently. Remediation efforts and <lb/>biodiversity-offsets or compensatory mitigation, which ensure that the environmental damage in one area <lb/>is compensated in another, can play a role to mitigate excessive stresses on water resources. For example, <lb/>the EPA has established &quot; mitigation banking &quot; to preserve wetlands. Under this approach, projects that will <lb/>have unavoidable impacts on wetlands must purchase offset credits to support the establishment, <lb/>restoration or enhancement of wetlands in a different location, which may be undertaken by a third party. <lb/>In a similar approach to offsets, the federal government uses royalties from the depletion of oil and gas <lb/></body>

			<body>resources on the outer continental shelf held in the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to protect <lb/>other natural resources. Similarly, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Coastal Impact Assistance <lb/>Program (CIAP) which provides money for coastal restoration and preservation for littoral states. While <lb/>the offset approach has attractive properties, care is needed to ensure that there are not non-linearities with <lb/>the depreciation of natural capital in one location that cannot be offset by supporting natural capital in <lb/>another (see Dasgupta, 2009 for a general consideration of these issues). In this context, the permitting <lb/>authority needs to ensure that the proposed project does not have unavoidable (irreversible) consequences, <lb/>such as contamination of a groundwater aquifer, that outweigh the proposed benefits. When irreversible <lb/>effects are a concern, the regulatory authority should postpone decisions until new information helps <lb/>reduce uncertainty about the consequences. Such decisions should also account for the public&apos;s preferences <lb/>for environmental services, which vary across the country. In this context, taking stock of opinions, such as <lb/>is done by Canada&apos;s biennial Household and the Environment Survey, would help better inform decisions <lb/>concerning the environment at both the national and state level. <lb/>… and risks water contamination <lb/>Risks from hydraulic fracturing wells include contamination of shallow freshwater aquifer and surface <lb/>water with chemicals and other substances used or released in the fracturing process. Reports examining <lb/>the potential for contamination of drinking water suggest that risks to aquifers are low if the hydraulic <lb/>fracturing takes place at sufficient depth. However, contamination risks stemming from faulty wells and <lb/>accidental spillage leading to surface water contamination remain (Royal Society, 2012). Groundwater <lb/>contamination risk remains a major concern expressed by residents. This can also be seen through the <lb/>effect on property prices. Early evidence, using data from Pennsylvania and New York on house sales and <lb/>well placement suggests that houses near the wells benefit from economic rents, but within a close radius <lb/>of 1-1.5 km, the fear of groundwater contamination pushes house prices down (between 10% and 22%) <lb/>compared to houses that rely on public water supplies (Muehlenbachs et al., 2012). Households may suffer <lb/>from adjacency effects, which push prices down further next to the wells. Overall the study noted that the <lb/>benefits from shale gas arrive quickly but then dissipate, consistent with a boom and bust type of <lb/>development. <lb/>Water is often co-produced with hydraulic fracturing, which creates challenges for treatment and <lb/>disposal, such as separating out and re-injecting in lower appropriate disposal zones. Some of the water <lb/>introduced in the well (15-80%) will become &quot; flowback &quot; , which may need to be treated due to chemicals <lb/>added to the fracturing fluids as well as the materials mobilised during the fracturing process, such as <lb/>heavy metals and naturally-occurring radioactive materials. The wastewater may be recycled and used in <lb/>other wells, re-injected deep underground (often into salinic acquifers), treated and added to surface water <lb/>or spread over the land. Kiviat (2013) reports a number of incidents where hydro-fracturing fluids have <lb/>been released into the environment and discusses the implications for biodiversity. Empirical work <lb/>suggests that the major problems are more likely to be found at the treatment sites than the wells <lb/>(Olmstead et al., 2013). Fracturing fluids contain chemicals to separate the oil and gas from the rock <lb/>formations and ease their passage through the rock as well as propping agents which hold the rock <lb/>formations open to allow the natural gas and oil to flow through the horizontal portion of the well to the <lb/>vertical portion of the well. Some states have not required the disclosure of what chemicals are being used <lb/>in fracturing fluids (McFeeley, 2012). However, other states have begun to require industry participants to <lb/>report which chemicals are being used and voluntary reporting of chemicals is occurring with groups such <lb/>as Fracfocus and the EPA is seeking public comments on disclosure. While exemptions to public <lb/>disclosure due to trade secrets can be part of the disclosure regime, these should not become a loophole and <lb/>companies should be required to report the chemicals being used to a regulatory authority. <lb/></body>

			<body>The regulatory regime is complex <lb/>Regulation on water use and the protection of groundwater and surface waters has originated at <lb/>different levels of governments, which has resulted in a complex overall regulatory regime. For example, <lb/>local authorities, groundwater management areas and regional planning bodies are involved in granting <lb/>access to water resources, and state and federal bodies are responsible for environmental management and <lb/>stewardship. Most regulation of hydraulic fracturing is issued at the state level, although the Department of <lb/>Interior can regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal land and EPA has some limited responsibility, which is <lb/>typically implemented by authorised states, tribes and territories. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water <lb/>Act, EPA&apos;s regulations specify minimum permitting requirements applicable to hydraulic fracturing of oil <lb/>and gas wells using diesel fuels. The EPA released guidance to state and EPA regional permit writers in <lb/>2014. These regulations also apply to underground injection of wastewaters from oil and gas production <lb/>(irrespective of use of diesel fuels) for purposes of disposal. In addition, under the federal Clean Water <lb/>Act, EPA&apos;s regulations restrict the discharge of hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface waters under the <lb/>national technology-based limitations programme. However, federal regulatory authority to address water <lb/>quality impacts of hydraulic fracturing is limited under several key environmental statutes – for example, <lb/>the oil and gas stormwater exemption from permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act and the <lb/>exclusion of hydraulic fracturing (other than where diesel is used) from the Safe Drinking Water Act <lb/>Underground Injection Control requirements. The federal authorities can also become involved when the <lb/>EPA issues an endangerment order, which can require a company to take immediate action to protect <lb/>individuals from harm (Rahm, 2011). Further study is needed to formulate regulation to address <lb/>environmental concerns and increase public confidence in hydraulic fracturing, notably to harmonise and <lb/>strengthen the impact assessments of drilling projects. <lb/>What happens when things go wrong? <lb/>Transportation needs for shale oil and gas have grown rapidly, often in regions where the existing <lb/>pipeline capacity is insufficient. This has led to a surge in railroad transport, with the number of railroad <lb/>carloads of crude oil jumping an estimated 42 times between 2008 and 2013 (Association of American <lb/>Railroads, 2013). Rail in late 2013 accounted for the transport of around 800 000 barrels a day or 11% of <lb/>total oil shipments. The transport of crude oil by train raises a number of risks. During 2013, a number of <lb/>accidents, including the explosion in North Dakota, reignited concerns about the safety of this mode of <lb/>transport, particularly in the aftermath of the Lac Mégantic tragedy in Canada. In this context, measures to <lb/>help develop pipeline capacity, such as expediting the planning process and reducing uncertainty about <lb/>projects, would be welcome. However, due to the dispersed nature of drilling, transporting oil to the <lb/>pipelines will still require other means of transportation. Federal authorities are responsible for setting rail <lb/>standards while state authorities, such as New York, are drawing up contingencies plans for the possibility <lb/>of accidents. To some extent, railroad transport is also favoured by the Jones Act, which bans foreign <lb/>shipping undertaking cabotage in US coastal waters. Railroads are ideally placed to benefit from the lack <lb/>of domestic shipping capacity. <lb/>A second area is what happens in the aftermath of significant environmental damage. After the <lb/>Deepwater Horizon event, Congress passed the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist <lb/>Opportunities, and Revived Economies (RESTORE) which channelled penalties levied under the Clean <lb/>Water Act for coastal restoration. Applying similar approaches for hydraulic fracturing may run into <lb/>problems. Due to the smaller size of firms involved, the possibility of appealing for bankruptcy can mean <lb/>that penalties will not cover all damage costs if the firm is found liable and it will not internalising the <lb/>externalities. Requiring insurance-type payments may lead to riskier behaviour than otherwise. In this <lb/>context, levying restoration fees, as many states already do to deal with clean-up costs and abandoned <lb/>wells, while leaving firms liable may be a reasonable approach. Alternatively, regulators could set <lb/>verifiable precautionary standards backed up by legal proceedings (Hiriart et al. 2004). An alternative <lb/></body>

			<body>approach could be implemented through bonding requirements, which are already used in a number of <lb/>states and by the federal government. Under this approach, companies post bonds prior to drilling wells. If <lb/>the exploitation results in no environmental damage the bond is returned to the company when production <lb/>at the well ceases (Davis, 2014). States with a longer experience of oil and gas production tend to have <lb/>stricter regulations in place and levy restoration fees or bonds (Richardson et al., 2013). <lb/>Links to climate change <lb/>In 2009, the United States committed to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the <lb/>range of 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. There have been sizeable reductions in emissions, partly arising <lb/>due to the recession as well as to improvements in energy efficiency in the economy (Figure 8). In 2012, <lb/>carbon emissions from the energy sector fell to the lowest level in two decades. Among OECD countries, <lb/>the United States has achieved among the biggest improvements in energy intensity in recent decades, <lb/>albeit from relatively high levels. Its energy intensity declined at an average rate of 2% per year from 1980 <lb/>to 2010. In recent years, policy efforts to improve energy efficiency further have been reinforced. For <lb/>example, the 2009 economic stimulus package included new energy efficiency initiatives and substantial <lb/>additional funding for existing programs. In June 2013, the administration unveiled a comprehensive <lb/>Climate Action Plan, including a plan to impose carbon emissions standards to both new and existing <lb/>power plants. <lb/>Despite the positive trends, preliminary data show that carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have <lb/>risen by around 2% in 2013. During the summer of 2013, higher demand for electricity induced an increase <lb/>in coal-fired electricity supply and severe winter weather raised energy demand at the end of the year, <lb/>boosting carbon dioxide emissions and highlighting the interplay between weather conditions and the <lb/>electricity sector (Box 3). <lb/>The current approach to meet climate change objectives relies less on using market-based instruments, <lb/>such as an emission tax, and more on regulation. In this context, the EPA is charged with regulating <lb/>greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation under the Clean Air Act. The states will have <lb/>flexibility in how to implement these requirements for power plants in their jurisdictions, thereby allowing <lb/>them to choose locally-appropriate compliance measures. Other initiatives to improve energy efficiency <lb/>will serve to reduce emissions further. This approach to emission abatement is arguably more costly than <lb/>an emission tax, though by inducing fuel switching may achieve some reductions at relatively low cost <lb/>(Goulder et al. 2014). However, with this approach, care is needed to prevent the marginal abatement costs <lb/>diverging too much. Given the variety of approaches the states are likely to adopt, including market-based <lb/>cap-and-trade schemes (see Box 4), regulation may be needed to limit differences in the stringency of <lb/>regulation as well as address possible coordination failures across states. Carefully designed state-level <lb/>policy has the potential to achieve considerable emission mitigation at relatively low cost <lb/>(Burtraw et al. 2014). <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)43 <lb/></body>

			<body>Box 3. Greater weather variability <lb/>The scientific evidence assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013) points to climate <lb/>change amplifying extreme weather events, with the effects varying regionally. The types of extreme weather events <lb/>that are becoming more frequent include longer heat waves and heavier precipitation. In North America the threat of <lb/>flooding and more intense storms also appears to have risen. <lb/>The combination of changing weather patterns with trends in energy demand has had implications for electricity <lb/>generation. Energy demand has changed as the share of industry in total output has fallen, technology has become <lb/>more energy efficient and the greater diffusion of air conditioning. These trends have led to electricity demand <lb/>becoming more weather sensitive such that when weather conditions lead to more use of cooling or heating, demand <lb/>for electricity surges. Over time as the reduction in consumption from sectoral change and improved energy efficiency <lb/>has reduced the average demand for electricity, the increasing sensitivity of demand to heating or cooling has seen the <lb/>ratio of peak to average demand for electricity gradually increase (Figure 9). During the periods of surges in demand, <lb/>the marginal producer of electricity may change with corresponding changes in fuel type. In 2013, more days had <lb/>pronounced peaks in temperature which would require cooling in buildings (raising cooling degree days) while the <lb/>winter in early 2014 was exceptionally cold raising the amount of heating needed to maintain a comfortable <lb/>temperature in buildings (raising heating degree days). Partly as a result, emissions of carbon dioxide from coal rose <lb/>by an estimated 2%, reversing some of the gains in emission reductions recorded over the previous five years as <lb/>previously mothballed coal-fired power stations were brought back on line. Greater weather variability complicates the <lb/>management of the electricity market and potentially makes climate change mitigation more difficult to achieve in the <lb/>absence of other measures. To the extent that the weather patterns are becoming more volatile, these challenges may <lb/>become more difficult to address. <lb/>Figure 9. Variation in electricity demand is growing <lb/>Ratio of peak-to-average electricity demand in New England <lb/>Source: Energy Information Administration. <lb/>Shale gas can help reduce emissions <lb/>Natural gas is a potential &quot; bridge fuel &quot; towards a lower carbon economy. The rapid development of <lb/>US shale gas resources has helped to reduce emissions by leading to a substitution away from coal-<lb/>powered electricity generation to natural gas turbines (Figure 7). Indeed, coal-fired power stations have <lb/>been under pressure from slowing electricity demand and competition from low natural gas prices. Coal-<lb/>fired electricity generation has fallen by around 11 percentage points of total electricity production <lb/>between 2008 and 2012, while natural gas accounted for a rise of 9 percentage points between 2008 and <lb/>2012, suggesting little &quot; rebound effect &quot; induced by cheaper natural gas prices. Furthermore, prospects for <lb/>some coal-fired power stations are weakened further by Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>1.9 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>1.4 <lb/>1.5 <lb/>1.6 <lb/>1.7 <lb/>1.8 <lb/>1.9 <lb/>2.0 <lb/>1993 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 <lb/></body>

			<body>will take effect in April 2015. The EIA (2012) projects that this will lead to significant retirement of coal-<lb/>fired power capacity. These trends are likely to reduce externalities significantly. Detailed county-level <lb/>modelling for the United States suggests that by taking into account estimates of the environmental and <lb/>health impact of coal-fired power generation the harmful impact of air pollution from the sector is double <lb/>the conventional measure of value added. By contrast, the ratio of harmful impacts of air pollution from <lb/>natural gas-fired generation to the sector&apos;s value added is only one third (Muller et al., 2011). <lb/>Natural gas can play a role in helping renewable energy gain a greater share of electricity generation <lb/>by helping to address the intermittency problem. Renewables are often a &quot; must-take &quot; generation source, <lb/>which means that when electricity generation from renewable sources fluctuates the system operator must <lb/>somehow achieve balance elsewhere (Weiss et al., 2013). From a security-of-supply perspective <lb/>renewables can thus create challenges to system operators. As natural gas fired generators can adapt <lb/>relatively quickly to changes in demand and supply they have a role to play in facilitating the expansion of <lb/>renewables. This might happen because electricity production from natural gas would help meet demand <lb/>when generation from wind and solar electricity drops or rises due to changes in wind and sunlight. In this <lb/>context, an energy mix focusing on the combination of natural gas and renewables in electricity generation <lb/>will go a long way towards providing reliable supply while lowering US greenhouse gas emissions. <lb/>However, gas-powered generators cannot react quickly enough to offset sudden large surges or drop offs in <lb/>renewable supply. In this context, developing storage capacity, smart grid technologies and price sensitive <lb/>demand would complement renewable and natural gas generated electricity (Benatia et al., 2013). <lb/>Finally, relatively low natural gas prices will also affect emissions from the transport sector, making <lb/>natural gas powered vehicles more attractive. Already low natural gas prices and the expectation that they <lb/>will remain low has induced investment in natural gas powered vehicles. The implementation in 2014 of <lb/>EPA regulations extending fuel economy standards to medium and heavy-duty vehicles will likely give a <lb/>further fillip to natural gas powered vehicles. As the refuelling network is expanded this could induce an <lb/>expansion from short-haul to long-haul trucking, leading to further gains in emission reductions (EIA, <lb/>2013). The EIA projects that the transportation sector&apos;s consumption of natural gas will almost double by <lb/>2040, with a large part of demand driven by gas-powered heavy duty vehicles. <lb/>The shale gas challenge for climate change <lb/>Fugitive methane emissions and gas flaring <lb/>While the substitution of natural gas for coal leads to lower emissions in electricity generation, the <lb/>production of non-conventional natural gas leads to emissions of fugitive methane during production, due <lb/>to leaks from loose fitting pipes and venting from gas wells, and transportation. More work remains to be <lb/>done to quantify the scale of these emissions and at what points in production and transportation they <lb/>occur. More is known about production than distribution (Allen et al., 2013; EPA, 2013; IEA, 2012). <lb/>Accounting for these emissions could significantly reduce the climate benefits from switching to natural <lb/>gas, though they are unlikely to offset the long-term benefits from substituting away from coal. <lb/>Furthermore, relatively few sources may be high emitters and tools to identify rapidly and fix these leaks <lb/>could have large benefits (Brandt et al., 2014). <lb/>The EPA has in place a long-standing and voluntary Natural GasSTAR Programme that encourages <lb/>the use of cost-efficient technologies to reduce and capture methane emissions. The administration has <lb/>announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, building on the STAR <lb/>programme. EPA guidance was to flare these emissions, as this reduces the potency of the emissions, but <lb/>following amendments to air regulations for the oil and gas industry in 2012 (new source performance <lb/>standards) companies are encouraged to move towards &quot; green completion &quot; of wells, which separates gas <lb/>and liquids flowing from the well and captures the gas. The second phase of the amendments starting in <lb/></body>

			<body>2015 requires companies to capture the gas and make it available for use or sale. In some cases, states and <lb/>local governments have already moved to address this issue for example, Colorado, in collaboration with <lb/>industry, has established regulations on minimising methane emissions. In other cases, states have <lb/>considered using taxation on flaring or venting, which would help gas producers internalise global <lb/>externalities. The differences across states regarding regulations on flaring or venting methane can be <lb/>considerable, partly reflecting the relative development of pipeline infrastructure. For example, flaring <lb/>methane in Texas is permitted in some case for 180 days, whereas in North Dakota flaring is allowed for <lb/>one year before becoming liable to pay taxes and royalties on the flared gas. In addition, exemptions may <lb/>then be granted if there are difficulties in connecting to a pipeline. At times, almost one-third of all gas <lb/>produced in North Dakota has been flared or otherwise not marketed (EIA, 2011). <lb/>Knock on effects on energy markets <lb/>The substitution of natural gas for coal has seen repercussions on the market for coal. Despite <lb/>declining domestic demand, US coal production has fallen relatively little as coal exports have more than <lb/>doubled since the shale gas boom began to take hold in 2007 (Figure 10). Low carbon permit prices on the <lb/>European market are inducing energy producers to increase their combustion of coal leading to a global <lb/>rise in carbon emissions. Appropriately pricing the carbon content of fuels, such as with an emission tax, <lb/>both in the United States and other countries, would ensure that the environmental benefits of switching to <lb/>natural gas in one country are not lost through increasing coal consumption in other countries <lb/>(see Golosov et al, 2014). Further rapid increases in coal exports may be limited by capacity constraints at <lb/>existing export terminals coupled with local opposition -concerned about particulate matter pollution -to <lb/>increasing railroad transportation and constructing new coal yards at ports. <lb/>Figure 10. Coal production has fallen while exports have risen <lb/>Million short tonnes <lb/>Source: Energy Information Administration. <lb/>Risks of lock-in <lb/>A final challenge for climate change policy arises from the risk of lock in, whereby choices made <lb/>today will limit the opportunities available in the future. The development of shale gas can support the <lb/>transition towards a lower carbon economy. As seen above, relatively low natural gas prices have already <lb/>encouraged fuel substitution towards less carbon-intensive energy production and provide a platform on <lb/>which to build. The question is will natural gas act as a &quot; bridge fuel &quot; to moving towards a zero net <lb/>emissions target or lead to inertia to additional mitigation, which may also arise due to stranded assets.

			<body>the absence of concerted action to manage the transition there is a danger that as relative prices change or <lb/>in the longer-term as natural gas begins to be depleted the energy market will respond by switching back to <lb/>coal-fired power. In this context, while the shale gas boom could provide the &quot; bridge fuel &quot; towards a lower <lb/>carbon economy, flanking measures (emission pricing, subsidising innovation, supporting renewables and <lb/>developing smart electricity grids) will be required to ensure this outcome. In particular, two areas were <lb/>flanking measures may be required are in countering natural gas hindering renewables and low prices <lb/>stymieing innovation. <lb/>The expansion of natural gas fired generation may hinder the future development of renewable <lb/>energy. The development of smart grids -which offers the potential to harness renewable energy <lb/>effectively -is incremental and path dependent (Koenigs et al. 2013). Without careful preparation, the <lb/>current expansion of natural gas and development of the supporting electricity infrastructure could hinder <lb/>future movement towards a lower carbon economy by creating difficulties in integrating a larger share of <lb/>more volatile renewable sources of energy. Against this background, the different government and private <lb/>actors need to co-ordinate their activities and support long-term investments that will re-orientate <lb/>transmission and distribution towards networks which can accommodate a larger share of low or (net) no <lb/>carbon electricity generation. The US Energy Independence and Security Act (2007) and the American <lb/>Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) have provided government support and funding for nationwide <lb/>modernisation of the electrical grid and ensure stable mid-term prospects for private investors. The Federal <lb/>Energy Regulatory Commission also works to promote the modernisation of the grid and the integration of <lb/>renewables in electricity generation. Such actions are important in overcoming possible lock in effects. <lb/>Box 4. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative <lb/>In 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), bringing together initially 10 states, introduced a cap-<lb/>and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions. <lb/></body>

			<note place="footnote">1 The initiative covers all large fossil-fuel electricity plants in the states <lb/>with the cap based on long-term modelling predating the dramatic changes in energy prices, resulting in an initial <lb/>allocation of too many allowances. The substitution towards natural gas has been particularly pronounced in the states <lb/>covered by RGGI, with coal and oil-fired electricity generation falling from accounting for 35% of electricity production <lb/>in 2005 to 13% in 2012. Furthermore, clement weather conditions reducing energy demand also helped bring down <lb/>emissions dramatically below the agreed cap. In response, 9 of the original 10 states agreed to a 45% reduction in the <lb/>cap from 2014.In addition, the cap is now designed to tighten further gradually. This feature should mean the emission <lb/>cap becomes more challenging over time and that the price of emission allowances begins to rise. The states use <lb/>revenues from the auction of allowances to support renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. <lb/>To some extent the approach to climate change adopted by the administration, which has the effect of making <lb/>coal-fired electricity generation less competitive, benefits schemes like RGGI by levelling the playing field and reducing <lb/>possible concerns about &quot; leakage &quot; . Nonetheless, combining command and control approaches with market <lb/>mechanisms risks increasing the overall costs of climate change mitigation. <lb/>1. California subsequently introduced a cap-and-trade program in 2012. <lb/>At the state level, Renewable Portfolio Standards, in place in 30 states, will ensure that renewable <lb/>sources account for a set share of generation. Under these programmes, electricity providers are mandated <lb/>to purchase a specified share of electricity from renewable generation sources, usually with the share rising <lb/>over time. While these policies have had a strong effect on the growth of this sector, and they may counter <lb/>the danger of lock in, they nonetheless come at a higher cost than market-based mechanisms. However, <lb/>removing restrictions in state Renewable Portfolio Standards on the location of renewable generation and <lb/>mitigating federal and state incentives to generate power when prices are negative would increase the <lb/>social benefit of these programs. (Schmalensee, 2013). Well-targeted and time-limited policies to support <lb/>renewable energy can speed the deployment of renewable energy generation capacity. <lb/></note>

			<body>A final area where low natural gas prices may present a challenge to greenhouse gas mitigation is <lb/>through the effect on innovation. The United States is a leader in innovation on energy efficiency <lb/>technologies, although only a fraction of government R&amp;D support is allocated to the environment <lb/>and energy (about 1.8% of government R&amp;D). Patent filings related to green growth have been <lb/>steadily rising since 1990 and began outpacing the growth of total US patents since 2005.The impressive <lb/>gains in energy efficiency witnessed over the past decades were partly driven by high prices driving <lb/>innovation in energy-saving technology (Popp, 2002; Aghion et al. 2012). In order to mitigate these <lb/>undesirable outcomes, some subsidisation of innovation in energy saving technology to &quot; direct &quot; technical <lb/>change would be warranted. Such an approach would be in line with the policy mix advocated by <lb/>Acemoglu et al. (2012), who showed that optimal environmental policy would use carbon taxes in <lb/>combination with subsidies to direct innovation activity towards the &quot; clean &quot; sector when goods are <lb/>substitutable. Case study evidence supports an approach of combining taxation and subsidisation in <lb/>promoting innovation to improve environmental outcomes (OECD, 2010). At the federal level, the <lb/>America COMPETES Act created the Advanced Research Projects Agency -Energy, which funds energy <lb/>technology projects. More recently, the administration has proposed to create an Energy Security Trust <lb/>Fund, which would work in this direction. Certain states, notably California -and also participants in <lb/>RGGI -have also invested in promoting energy efficiency and clean generation technologies. <lb/>Recommendations <lb/>Hydraulic fracturing <lb/>•  Study the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and develop regulations to address any negative<lb/>impacts including, if necessary, legislative action to harmonise regulation across states and strengthen ex <lb/>ante environmental impact assessments for drilling projects. <lb/>•  Invest in skills and infrastructure using receipts from profit taxes levied on oil and gas production.<lb/>Climate change <lb/>•  Further lower emissions with efficient policy tools as part of the climate-change strategy, notably by putting a<lb/>price on greenhouse gas emissions, though well-designed regulation and investment in renewables also <lb/>have a role to play. <lb/>•  Promote innovation in energy saving and low carbon technology.<lb/>Further recommendations <lb/>•  Ensure that trade restrictions do not hamper energy exports.<lb/>•  Study the problem of fugitive methane emissions, and develop regulations to address any negative impacts.<lb/>•  Promote investment in infrastructure for energy transportation, taking into account safety concerns.<lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)43 <lb/></body>

			<body>ANNEX <lb/>OIL AND GAS RESERVE DEVELOPMENTS <lb/>Introduction <lb/>1. <lb/>The successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies is contributing to an energy <lb/>renaissance in the United States. Natural gas supply in particular has surged and estimates of potentially <lb/>recoverable natural gas resources have been revised upwards considerably. Developments for crude oil <lb/>have been similar if less spectacular. Against this background, how policy can affect the development of <lb/>natural gas and crude oil deposits acquires some importance. The form of taxation most typically used in <lb/>the United States is the severance tax, more commonly known as a royalty tax. This form of taxation has <lb/>adverse effects on the incentives to developed new reserves and also to abandon wells earlier than they <lb/>would be using other forms of taxation, such as profit taxes, which are neutral to development and <lb/>production. <lb/>2. <lb/>The analysis in this annex examines the impact of taxation on the addition to natural gas and <lb/>crude oil reserves using US state-level data. This annex contains, first, a description of recent <lb/>developments in natural gas and crude oil reserves. It then briefly examines determinants of oil and gas <lb/>reserve growth. The third section describes the available data and the empirical approach to assessing these <lb/>influences. This is followed by a presentation and brief discussion of the results. <lb/>Recent reserve developments <lb/>3. <lb/>Estimates of proved reserves of oil and gas have altered dramatically recently, following the <lb/>successful deployment of new technologies for advanced drilling. The Energy Information Agency <lb/>markedly increased its estimates of recoverable gas resources (Figure 1). The addition of new proved <lb/>reserves has maintained the ratio of reserves to production for crude oil, which has been relatively stable <lb/>over a prolonged period. The recent surge in natural gas proved reserves has reversed a prolonged decline <lb/>in the reserves to production ration over the second half of the 20 th century (Figure 2).The distribution of <lb/>shale gas deposits across the country is quite widespread, though the proved reserves are predominantly <lb/>located in a handful of states, which is also where the large shale gas plays (i.e. where production is <lb/>occurring) are located. These developments have seen the proved natural gas reserves increase <lb/>significantly in a number of states (Figure 3). Recent increases in crude oil reserves have been relatively <lb/>less substantial overall, but within a handful of states (notably Texas, North Dakota) the increases in <lb/>proved reserves of oil is dramatic. <lb/>ECO/WKP(2014)43 <lb/></body>

			<body>Factors affecting reserve developments <lb/>4. <lb/>Examining reserve development rather than supply can avoid some of the complications <lb/>presented by the effects of changes to the rate of extraction and the influence of storage on short-run <lb/>supply (Ponce and Neumann, 2014). The approach adopted here looks at factors influencing the <lb/>development of proved reserves (IEA, 2013). Energy prices will play a role in determining proved reserves <lb/>by affecting the share of already discovered technically feasible reserves that are recoverable given <lb/>extraction and other costs. Prices will also affect the date at which a well is abandoned: other things being <lb/>equal, rising prices are likely to keep a well in production longer. <lb/>5. <lb/>Empirical findings suggest that natural gas supply is inelastic in the very short run, but is more <lb/>elastic in the longer run (Ponce and Neumann, 2014). While supply may be relatively inelastic, investment <lb/>in exploration and development appears to react to price changes, as shown by the rapid increase in the <lb/>number of crude oil rotary rigs when relative prices changed for oil and gas (Figure 4). In 2007/8 as the <lb/>shale gas boom began to lead to a surge in supply, natural gas prices collapsed while crude oil prices <lb/>continued recovering after the financial crisis, pushing up the relative price of crude oil substantially. Other <lb/>factors may also lead to a structural break in the oil and gas mining sector around this time. The successful <lb/>introduction of hydraulic fracturing may have affected the success of finding reserves. Forbes and Zampelli <lb/>(2002) argue that deposits in tight sands and shale are easier to locate than conventional reserves and that <lb/>hydrocarbons at shallower depths are more easily discovered. <lb/>6. <lb/>Besides the physical availability of drilling rigs, the tax regime in place is likely to influence <lb/>incentives for exploration and development of reserves. Andrade de Sá and Daubanes (2014) point out that <lb/>royalty taxes are likely to blunt incentives to develop reserves and also give incentives to abandon wells <lb/>before would be the case with other taxes, such as profit taxes. Royalty (severance) taxes are the <lb/>predominant tax instrument used in the United States for capturing some of the resource rent. Only Alaska <lb/>implements a profits tax (alongside a royalty tax). On the other hand, Pennsylvania does not attempt to tax <lb/>the resource rent from hydraulic fracturing. Taxes on production reported by the BEA for the oil and gas <lb/>mining sector includes severance taxes and also the normal corporate income taxes, which the federal <lb/>authorities levy on all companies. The overall tax take relative to sectoral value added can vary enormously <lb/>across the states, but also across time within states (Figure 5). To some extent these differences will reflect <lb/>the differences in the severance taxes, though variations in tax schedules, such as lower rates offered for <lb/>the use of enhanced recovery techniques, will also play a role. The Census Bureau reports state severance <lb/>tax revenues. However, these revenues are not restricted to oil and gas mining. <lb/></body>

Production taxes on oil and gas mining <lb/>As % of sectoral value added <lb/>Source: BEA <lb/>Estimation and data <lb/>7. <lb/>The empirical approach adopted is an autoregressive distributed lag (ADRL) model (Pesaran <lb/>et al., 2001). This approach allows the estimation of a relationship in levels as well as complex short-run <lb/>dynamics and the mixing of series that are stationary and non-stationary. The general form of this model is: <lb/>񮽙 񮽙 = = + 񮽙 񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>+ + 񮽙 񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>+ + 񮽙 <lb/>where Y is the dependent variable and X is a set of explanatory variables. The actual specification used in <lb/>the following analysis exploits the state-level information using a panel data approach, taking the form of <lb/>an unrestricted error correction model with the following specification: <lb/>∆∆ , = = + 񮽙 񮽙 , <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>+ + 񮽙 񮽙 , <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>+ + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + 񮽙 ∆∆ , + + 񮽙 + <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>񮽙񮽙񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 <lb/>񮽙񮽙񮽙 <lb/>񮽙 񮽙񮽙 <lb/>where Y is the measure of reserves (dry and wet natural gas reserves and crude oil proved reserves) and X <lb/>includes the relevant natural gas or crude oil price, the number of drilling rigs operating in the state and the <lb/>tax revenues in the oil and gas mining sector. The model is estimated with state-level fixed effects to take <lb/>into account unobserved heterogeneity at the state level. As energy prices are not available at the state-<lb/>level, period fixed effects are not used. The lag length is set to one, partly due to the limited number of <lb/>time periods available, but this choice is also supported by the Schwarz criterion for lag length selection. <lb/>8. <lb/>The addition to reserves is assumed to be driven by energy prices, the exploration and <lb/>development activities and the prevailing tax regime. The data for reserves is taken from the Energy <lb/>Information Agency (EIA) using proved dry natural gas reserves (wet reserves are also used for robustness <lb/>checks) and crude oil for states. Drilling activity at the state level is from Backer Hughes, but this has the <lb/>shortcoming that state level information does not indicate whether the drilling rig is being used for oil or <lb/>natural gas exploration.

			<body>2014). Investment in the number of drilling rigs is unsurprisingly associated with reserve growth. Higher <lb/>tax revenues from the oil and gas mining sector slow the development of natural gas reserves. The <lb/>estimates using slightly different measures of reserves and prices are very similar (Column 2 uses wet <lb/>natural gas reserves, while Column 3 reports results when using the Henry Hub natural gas price rather <lb/>than the wellhead price). When the sample is extended to 2011, the statistical significance diminishes, <lb/>though the estimates are quantitatively similar in size. In part, this result is driven by the inclusion of <lb/>Pennsylvania, where exceptionally rapid reserve growth in 2010 and 2011 suggest that a structural break <lb/>occurs when the hydraulic fracturing boom takes hold. Finally, the results reported for crude oil reserves <lb/>are weak, with most variables being statistically insignificant. Dropping the tax variable, so as to estimate <lb/>the equation for a longer time period reveals the expected long-run relationship between reserve and prices <lb/>as well as investment in drilling rigs. The implied long-run elasticity of supply of almost 0.4 is close to <lb/>other estimates (Brook et al, 2004). <lb/>Table A.3.
