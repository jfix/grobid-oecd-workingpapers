	<p type="introduction">The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS<lb/> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/> Patent data provide an increasingly used means to analyse innovation performance worldwide<lb/> including in countries with incomplete data coverage, such as some developing countries. This paper<lb/> focuses on the construction of indicators and analytical methodologies for measuring innovation in<lb/> climate-and other environment-related technologies. A companion paper discusses the use of such<lb/> indicators for policy purposes (see Haščič and Migotto 2015).<lb/> Various approaches have previously been developed to improve cross-country comparability of<lb/> patent statistics. However, they were generally limited either because they require additional data that<lb/> might not be available in all countries or because they impose restrictions that are less appropriate for<lb/> analysis of narrow technological fields. The simultaneity of two conditions – narrow technological<lb/> scope and comparability across a wide range of countries – often renders existing indicators inapt for<lb/> such analyses. This paper advocates the use of indicators based on patent family size because they are<lb/> more flexible and can be adapted to such applications.<lb/> This paper also examines certain idiosyncratic characteristics of patent databases. The sources of<lb/> such idiosyncrasies include unequal country and temporal coverage of patent databases, asymmetric<lb/> information on patent protection in member states through regional applications, missing descriptive<lb/> information in patent databases, and non-homogeneous assignment of patent classes and the<lb/> consequent difficulty of identifying relevant patent documents. This suggests that all patent databases<lb/> should be exploited with care. The paper proposes approaches to mitigate potential biases in empirical<lb/> cross-country analyses. While doing so is particularly important for analyses of narrow technological<lb/> fields such as environment and climate related technologies, many of these issues are relevant for<lb/> patent analysis more broadly.<lb/> The Use of Patent Statistics for International Comparisons and Analysis of Narrow Technological Fields<lb/> OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY WORKING PAPERS</p>
