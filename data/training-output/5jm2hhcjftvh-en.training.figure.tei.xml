            <figDesc>Regional variation in life satisfaction<lb/> Mean satisfaction with life; 0-10 points scale; average 2006-2014<lb/> Note: Countries are ordered by increasing regional variation.<lb/> Source: Authors&apos; elaborations from Gallup World Poll data.<lb/> Regional responses on life satisfaction from the Gallup survey were benchmarked against the national<lb/> surveys of Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom whose samples are designed to be representative at the<lb/> subnational level, and, for the European countries, with the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions<lb/> (EU SILC). In general the formulation of the question on life satisfaction is similar in the different surveys,<lb/> although only Gallup uses the image of the ladder while the other surveys ask directly &quot; Overall, how<lb/> satisfied are you with your life nowadays? &quot; The answers are on an 11 points scale (from zero to ten) for all<lb/> the surveys, while the target population slightly differs in age (14 years and over in Italy, 15 years and over<lb/> in Mexico and 16 years and over in the United Kingdom). Other OECD countries have published official<lb/> data on subjective well-being at subnational level, although we could not use them for this paper. Since 2013 the Life Satisfaction Survey in Turkey, for example, has been expanded to the regional and provincial<lb/> levels (corresponding to the TL2 and TL3 OECD regions). 12 However, the survey includes a question on<lb/> happiness on a 3 points scale but no questions on satisfaction with life. Evaluation of life satisfaction at the<lb/> provincial level in Canada (OECD TL2 regions) on an 11 points scale is available through the Canadian<lb/> Community Health Survey run by Statistics Canada. However, the provincial results are presented only as<lb/> number of people who reported to be satisfied or very satisfied. 13<lb/> Large regional variations exist in life satisfaction in Italy. On average in 2013, 39.5% of citizens from<lb/> the North express a high satisfaction with life, 34% from the Centre and 29.6% from the South; regional<lb/> differences have narrowed since 2009, because of the decrease in life satisfaction from the Northern<lb/> regions (Istat, 2014). On average life satisfaction was equal to 7.8 in the Province of Bolzano and 6.5 in<lb/> Campania in the period 2010-2014</figDesc>
