Such movement of labour from less to more productive jobs boosted overall labour<lb/> productivity and growth. Agglomeration and scale economies further pushed up productivity. While the productivity<lb/> gains from internal migration will diminish gradually over time, urbanisation is likely to remain an important source<lb/> of productivity growth in the coming decade or so.<lb/> This paper first decomposes labour productivity growth over 2000-11 into a within-industry, a shift and a cross<lb/> effect in a number of countries and compares China with other countries over this period. This shift-share analysis<lb/> also allows a comparison of within-sector productivity gains across a large number of sectors and countries.<lb/> Labour productivity alongside total factor productivity is also discussed from the perspective of its gap with the<lb/> United States and growth rate over 2000-11 and in comparison with other BRIICS economies. In this analysis,<lb/> manufacturing and service industries are looked at separately.<lb/> This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of China<lb/> www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm<lb/> JEL classification: J24, D24.<lb/></div>
