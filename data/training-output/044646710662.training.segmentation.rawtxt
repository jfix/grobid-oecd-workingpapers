Programme of Work 2007-2008 on Development Finance and aims to be a concrete input for the 
OECD Global Forum on Development. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 5 PREFACE This working paper is a direct contribution to the newly created OECD Global Forum on 
Development that was launched in 2006. This Forum has been created with the aim of improving dialogue between OECD and 
non-member governments, as well as private and civil society actors. During the Forum's first 
thematic cycle (2006-2009), participants are invited to identify options for a more effective 
development finance system. The OECD Development Centre is actively and deeply involved in 
this process. One of its objectives is to look beyond aid and foresee the potential synergies 
between different types of actors, public and private, national and international, governmental 
and non-governmental, involved in development finance activities. The aim of this paper is precisely to contribute to this debate and process. It highlights 
how private banks and other private financial operators like private equity firms and 
investments funds, can play a pivotal role in economic development. All in all, they are 
interesting potential partners for public aid donors willing to deepen impacts on developing 
countries. As documented, some of the private banking firms are more active in specific regions. 
UK and French banks seem, for example, to be potential interesting partners for aid donors in 
Africa while Spanish banks or US counterparts are more relevant for Latin America and German, 
Swiss and Italian banks for Eastern Europe. Beyond international banks, local private banks in 
Brazil, India, South Africa, Morocco and other developing countries are becoming increasingly 
aware and sensitive to economic, social and environmental impacts. Several policy recommendations are made in the conclusions. One of them is to create a 
Prize on Development Finance that could reward best practices of public and private 
partnerships in development finance. The OECD Global Forum on Development could host such 
a Prize as it intends to strengthen the dialogue between aid donors and private actors working 
on development issues and investing in developing countries. The objective of the OECD 
Development Finance Prize would be to underline already existing best practices and, through a 
worldwide media campaign (like the one developed by the IFC and the Financial Times), to 
stimulate projects between donors and private banks, asset managers and equity firms.

D'une part, l'intérêt des donneurs d'aide pour le secteur privé s'est accru, et d'autre part, les 
banques privées ont développé des programmes pour promouvoir la responsabilité sociale des 
entreprises, le crédit soutenable, et des projets dans le domaine de la microfinance. En 
conséquence, le dialogue entre les banques privées et les donneurs d'aide s'est intensifié, ce qui 
laisse entrevoir une collaboration plus étroite à l'avenir. Le but de ce papier est d'évaluer 
précisément le potentiel de ces synergies entre banques privées et donneurs d'aide. Dans 
l'objectif de réaliser un outil d'analyse pertinent et d'aider à identifier des partenaires potentiels 
pour les donneurs d'aide, nous avons conduit une étude des crédits accordés par les banques 
privées aux pays en développement afin de repérer les institutions financières privées les plus 
actives au sein de ces économies. Nous montrons qu'il existe une division internationale dans 
l'activité de prêt des banques : les banques des pays donneurs opèrent une spécialisation 
régionale dans les pays en développement. La réalisation d'une telle étude de l'activité créditrice 
des banques privées permet également d'introduire un exercice de repérage des meilleures 
pratiques, au niveau micro, des projets spécifiques développés conjointement par les banques 
privées et les donneurs d'aide. Nous dégageons les principaux cas d'étude, dans l'objectif de 
repérer les meilleures opportunités de coopération internationale et de mise en place de 
partenariats public/privé entre les banques privées et les donneurs d'aide. Mots clé : Banques, Crédit, Donneurs d'aide, Finance du développement, Afrique, Amérique 
latine, Asie OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 7 ABSTRACT Over the past decade we have witnessed a double convergence. Aid donors have 
developed a growing interest in the private sector while private banks have set about creating 
corporate social responsibility programs, sustainable lending and microfinance programmes. As 
a consequence, the dialogue between private banks and aid donors has been intensifying, 
opening new avenues for collaboration. The aim of this paper is to map the potential synergies 
between private banks and aid donors. A survey of private bank lending towards developing 
countries is undertaken in order to identify the private banks most active in those economies and 
provide an analytical tool to help identify the scope for public and private partnerships. We find 
an international division of labour in bank lending: within the developing world, banks from 
OECD countries tend to focus their credit on specific regions and countries. This mapping of 
private bank lending also allows us to pinpoint concrete examples of best practices in private 
bank and financial actors/aid donors collaborations. We follow by discussing some of the more 
important cases in the field, and conclude with the potential implications for improved 
partnerships between private banks and donor organisations. JEL Classification: F3; O1; G21. Key words: Banks; Lending; Aid donors; Development Finance; Africa; Latin America; Asia. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 8 © OECD 2007 I. INTRODUCTION  " The life of money making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth is evidently not the 
good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else " . Aristotle, The Nichomachean Ethics, Book I.5, written around 350 B.C. Over the past decade we have witnessed a double convergence. Aid donors have 
developed an increasing interest in the private sector while private banks have created corporate 
social responsibility programs, sustainable lending or microfinance programmes. This paper 
aims to map potential synergies between private banks and aid donors. Over the course of the first OECD Global Forum on Development, held in early 
April 2007, many aid donors expressed a growing interest for a deeper dialogue with the private 
sector, including corporations or foundations, for example 1 . This interest found echo in the first 
flagship publication of the OECD Development Centre on development financing (OECD, 
2007a), which argued on the need to go beyond aid and incorporate new actors into the financing 
of development. The 2005 OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) annual report also 
stressed the fundamental importance of this deepening dialogue with the private sector (OECD, 
2007b). Over the past decade, bilateral donors have developed new financial tools and 
institutions to improve their work with developing countries. Following the assumption that 
public money may be a catalyst for private resources, leading donor agencies have strived to 
mobilise private sector resources and capacities for poverty reduction. Most European donors, 
for example, have established Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) operating on a 
commercial basis, that have become an integral part of government development policy. For instance, in 2005, Switzerland established the Swiss Investment Fund for Emerging 
Markets (SIFEM) 2 , as a spin-off of SECO (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, one of the 
main national institutions in charge of development cooperation). In collaboration with other 
donor agencies such as Proparco (the French Development Finance Institution, a subsidiary of 1.

Countries (BIO 
4 ), SIFEM now participates in many private equity projects around the developing world, working with local private financial operators like Tuninvest in Tunisia, Fidelity Capital 
Partners (a private venture capital and private equity company, subsidiary of Fidelity 
Investment) in Ghana, Ethos in South Africa, Nexxus in Mexico or BTS Investment Advisors in 
India 5 . As we will see, these initiatives are not the only ones where private and public 
institutions have converged to boost development projects. These national financial institutions also developed the European Development Finance 
Institutions (EDFI) network, a group of fifteen bilateral institutions providing long-term capital 
for private sector enterprises in developing and reforming economies. The institutions in this 
group share common objectives but are quite different in the way they develop their operations. 
Some of them are still mostly financial institutions offering capital and advice to joint venture 
enterprises in developing countries, and collaborating on projects with national. Danish IFU, 
Swedish Swedfund or Spanish COFIDES 
6 , both members of EDFI, support projects mostly in a context of Danish or Spanish companies' involvement. Other members like CDC 7 , a UK government-owned fund with nearly $3 billion of net 
assets, work actively with worldwide private equity partners like London based Aureos Capital, 
Indian based Barings Private Partners or ICICI Venture, Canadian based Cordiant or Citigroup 
Venture Capital 
8 . As an example, in 2007 CDC backed a new African initiative, committing $100 million to Citigroup's first private equity vehicle entirely dedicated to Africa. The 
Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO)

See http://www.proparco.fr/. Interestingly, among the institutions that fund Proparco are also some 
French private banks like BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Natixis, Dexia Crédit Local or other private 
financial institutions like COFACE or Gras Savoye. African banks or other financial institutions from 
developing countries also participate in the capital, for example, Banque Marocaine du Commerce 
Extérieur, Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) or Banque de Tunisie. The Aga Khan 
Fund is particularly interesting. It is an international development agency dedicated to promoting 
entrepreneurship and building economically sound enterprises in the developing world. On Aga Khan 
Fund see http://www.akdn.org/agency/akfed.html 4.

See http://www.ifu.dk/http://www.swedfund.se/; and http://www.cofides.es/. Swedfund developed an 
interesting strategy of partnering with private sector asset managers and private equity companies like 
East Capital (http://www.eastcapital.com/) or Swedish companies like Tetra Pak or Ikea. Interestingly, 
as for Proparco, COFIDES also has private banks involved in its core capital, mainly BBVA, Santander 
and Banco Sabadell. 7.

FMO was formed in 1970 through a partnership between the Dutch government (the majority 
shareholder with 51 per cent) and Dutch financial institutions like ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, In Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 10 © OECD 2007 launched with Citigroup in 2006 a $540 million risk sharing facility aimed at providing loans to 
small and medium sized companies in poor countries. This was the first global partnership 
between an EDFI institution and a leading private retail bank. EDFIs have even participated in 
the creation of private equity companies, one of the most dynamic being Aureos Capital, created 
in 2001 by two leading EDFIs, the Norwegian Norfund (Norwegian Investment Fund for 
Developing Countries) and the UK's CDC Capital Partners 10 . Private banks have also shown an increasing awareness of social, environmental or 
labour issues in developing countries. In the course of their global expansion and acquisitions, 
OECD-based bankers have encountered new realities, constraints and opportunities in 
developing countries. Through either their lending operations, retail business on the ground or 
investment banking and asset management activities, emerging markets and developing 
countries have gradually grown to become core business areas. In parallel, when faced with 
increased pressures and demands from NGOs, activist investors and government pressures, 
private banks have also developed new programmes of sustainable lending and investment, and 
corporate social responsibility. These private institutions have thus found themselves entering 
projects in which they, directly or indirectly, may find themselves working to provide public 
goods such as education, health, microfinance and remittances-related services to the poor. Private banks have also become involved in infrastructure projects, and increasingly often 
sealing partnerships with the public sector in many countries. In Brazil, the ABN Amro 
subsidiary Banco Real 11 became a leading provider of micro-credits and grants to the poor for 
education related activities. Spanish banks, which are heavily involved in Latin America, have 
multiplied their initiatives throughout the region. Banco Santander, for example, promoted the 
creation of a huge educational platform Universia 12 . Both of Spain's leading banks, Santander and 
BBVA 13 , in 2000 participated together with other ministries and private corporations in the 
creation of the Fundación Carolina, a unique Spanish institution funded by both the public and 
private sectors whose aim is to provide grants for Latin American wishing to pursue studies in 
Spain 14 . 2007, FMO has an investment portfolio of almost €2 billion and a staff of more than 200. It is one of the 
largest bilateral private sector oriented development banks worldwide. 10. See http://www.norfund.no/. Norfund also participated in the creation of another private equity 
company, specializing in renewable energy related investments in Asia, Africa and Latin America: SN 
Power. See http://www.snpowerinvest.com/ 11. See http://www.bancoreal.com.br/. In 2006, Banco Real doubled its microfinance clients (350 000 
worldwide) and consolidated its sustainable banking division. See its Sustainability Report:

BANK LENDING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Bank(er)s have been very active in developing economies over the past decades, either 
through bank lending or through securities markets. The rising number of foreign claims (loans 
made and deposits placed in other countries) is a good measure of the rapid internationalisation 
of banking over the past decades. Nonetheless, it is not the only way in which OECD private 
banks have been involved in emerging countries. Over the past decades, OECD private banks have invested in and acquired major banks in 
developing countries 15 , boosting the share of foreign bank credit in total domestic credit: South 
America, for example, saw a jump from less than 6 per cent to nearly 40 per cent in 2005 16 . US 
and Spanish banks have been the most active in developing countries: between 1990 and 2003, 
they invested respectively $74 and $68 billion in developing countries, far ahead of UK 
($38 billion), German ($34 billion) or French ($32 billion) banks (Goldberg, 2007). Investment banks and asset managers did not stay behind in the emerging markets gold 
rush, investing through their regional or global emerging market funds 
17 . International bank lending also provides a good indicator of a division of labour that aids us in identifying key 
potential partners and synergies for public sector aid donors. The sums involved are quite 15. On internationalisation towards emerging markets, see Moreno and Villar, 2005; Domanski, 2005; 
Arena et al, 2006; Levy-Yeyati and Micco, 2007; Cerutti et al, 2007, and on banking internationalisation 
processes in general, see Schoenmaker and van Laecke, 2007. 16. Obviously the differences between regions, Africa and Latin America, or even within a region are 
important, foreign banks being much more present in some areas or countries than others. In Latin 
America, foreign banks' credit as a share of total domestic credit has jumped from less than 1 per cent to 
more than 90 per cent in a country like Mexico, between 1990 and 2005, In Costa Rica it is still lower 
than 1 per cent in 2005. In Belize, Bolivia or Panama, the share has been decreasing over the same 
period (BIS, 2007). 17. Not all the regions enjoyed a boom of portfolio flows, Africa remaining largely a  " frontier "  market with 
less bond and equity flows than other emerging markets areas like Asia or Latin America. Most of the 
Africa dedicated funds created in the 1990s by asset managers have been short lived, most of them 
closing at the beginning of the 2000s. By 2006 only seven of the Africa dedicated equity funds remained 
active. Interestingly, however, a new generation of funds started by the mid 2000s with asset managers 
like Investec opening a Pan-African Fund. For Global Emerging Markets Funds, investing worldwide, 
Africa represents 10 per cent of the total holdings, South Africa being by far the largest African holding 
of this category of funds. The 11 other African markets, where some investments are registered, 
attracted only a combined 0.03 per cent of total assets of global emerging markets funds. For a complete 
review of foreign institutional investors' activity in Africa see Moss, Ramachandran, Standley, 2007. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 12 © OECD 2007 impressive: according to BIS, the total claims flowing from OECD private banks to emerging 
economies in 2005 reached $230 billion, an amount twice as large as the total OECD official aid to 
developing countries 18 . That said, bank flows to emerging markets remain much weaker than those crossing 
borders between OECD countries: total cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks expanded by 
nearly 3 000 billion in developed countries in 2005, ten times more than in developing countries. 
All in all, by the end of 2005, the stock of cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks was 
$21 450 billion (BIS, 2006). Of this total, the bulk was directed to OECD developed economies, all 
of them democracies. Only $2 396 billion, less than 11 per cent of the total, went to emerging 
markets economies, the bulk of which went to emerging democracies such as South Korea, 
Brazil, and Mexico. A country like China only concentrates a stock of $114.6 billion of cross-
border bank claims, less than 0.53 per cent of the world stock 19 . Private foreign bank lending nonetheless constitutes a substantial fraction of 
development financing in emerging countries. As mentioned above, bank flows towards 
emerging countries are very low (in nominal terms) when compared with OECD countries. 
Despite this, bank loans are still very important for developing economies for despite actual 
amounts received are much lower than their OECD counterparts in nominal terms they represent 
a relatively high percentage of GDP. For example, in 2005, bank loans received by Brazil, Mexico 
and South Korea were equivalent to 20.1 per cent, 34.3 per cent, and 28 per cent of their GDP, 
respectively. Predictably, financial depth is lower in Latin America and Africa than in developed 
countries: during the 1990s credit to the private sector represented a paltry 21 per cent of GDP in 
sub-Saharan Africa and 28 per cent of GDP in Latin America, in comparison with the 84 per cent 
of GDP in developed countries (BIS, 2007). Of particular relevance for aid donors looking to promote economic, social, 
environmental and political development in emerging economies, private bankers have, over the 
past decade, also begun, in their assessment of investment decisions, begun to take new variables 
into account. In 2003, for example, a leading group of top global bankers adopted the Equator 
Principles, an unprecedented initiative led by 10 of the world's largest banks to address the social 
and environmental impact of the projects that they finance 20 . Based on IFC's environmental and 
social standards and developed with IFC's advice, the Principles are a voluntary set of guidelines 
for managing environmental and social issues in project finance lending. Since then, all the big 18. This is in fact the tip of the iceberg of international banking involvement in developing countries as, 
through the acquisitions processes, there has been an important shift towards more local activities, 
through branches and subsidiaries, with the subsequent implication that direct cross border activities 
are only part of the picture, with local lending by foreign banks in developing countries also being on 
the rise as underlined by the IMF (IMF, 2007). 19. In terms of bank assets the picture does not change as bank assets vis-à-vis OECD developed countries 
account for 37 per cent of world GDP and bank assets vis-à-vis emerging economies less than 3 per cent 
of world GDP. 20. See http://www.equator-principles.com/. For a critical monitoring of this initiative by a group of leading 
NGOs see BankTrack, Principles, profits or just PR? Triple P investments under the Equator principles. An 
anniversary assessment, BankTrack, 2004. See also http://www.banktrack.org/ OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 13 names in project finance (46 in total by early 2007, accounting for around 85 per cent of the 
world's cross-border project finance and 80 per cent of the lending market by the end of 2006 
21 ) have signed up for this series of guidelines for assessing their project finance deals, based on 
those used by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private financing arm 
(see Eiris, 2006 for an evaluation). As a result, the Equator Principles have become the project 
finance industry's global standard for addressing environmental and social issues. OECD banks with such impeccably capitalist credentials as Citibank, Standard Chartered, 
Calyon, Dexia, Credit Suisse, Intesa Sanpaolo, Dresdner, BBVA, ABN Amro or HSBC have all 
been eager to prove that their operations can measure up on sustainability goals. In 2006, a new 
revised set of guidelines (Equator II) was produced and approved by private banks, again with 
the help of the IFC. Equator II expands requirements for labour conditions, community health, 
safety and security. In complement to this, the IFC and the Financial Times launched in 2006 a 
sustainable banking award. The following year, more than 151 institutions from 51 countries 
submitted entries to the 2007 FT Sustainable Banking Awards, over 50 per cent more than the 
98 entries submitted to the inaugural 2006 Awards, a testimony to the programme's success and 
banks' increasing awareness of the issues promoted by the initiative. Dialogue between private banks and aid donors has also been intensifying on a number 
of levels, opening new avenues for collaboration. The UK official aid agency, Department for 
International Development (DFID), jointly with the Dutch development finance arm FMO, DEG, 
a subsidiary of Germany's KfW 22 , and the Development Bank of Southern Africa have created a 
public private equity African Infrastructure Fund with UK based private banks, Barclays and 
Standard Chartered, and the investment firm Emerging Markets Partnership 23 . The Government 
of Canada also established a Canada Investment Fund for Africa (CIFA) 24 , a $220 million fund 
dedicated to making private equity investments in businesses throughout Africa. Investors in 
CIFA include the Canadian International Development Agency (through the Canada Fund for 
Africa program) and CDC Group plc. The fund is managed through a joint venture between two 
leading private equity fund managers, London based Aureos Capital and Montreal based 
Cordiant 25 . In both sending and recipient countries, banks such as BBVA, the leading Spanish bank in 
Latin America, have targeted specific projects and programmes dedicated to migrants and 
remittance recipients. The extent of services provided go well beyond financing: in early 2007, 
BBVA launched a foundation dedicated to microfinance with an initial endowment of 
€200 million, making it one of the major initiatives in this field in Latin America. The bank 
became the first private international banking group to embrace micro-finance with direct 
investment via a non profit-making foundation. BBVA Microfinance Foundation initiated its first 21. See http://www.equator-principles.com/documents/ClientBriefingforEquatorPrinciples_2007-02-07.pdf 22. See http://www.kfw.de/EN_Home/index.jsp; and http://www.deginvest.de/EN_Home/index.jsp. DEG

Mundial de la Mujer in Bogotá and Medellín) and is part of the Group's investments in its social 
action program to the height of €55 million in 2006 26 . The potential synergies between private banks and aid donors are therefore considerable. 
In order to provide an analytical tool and to help identify potential partners for aid donors, we 
conducted a survey of private bank lending towards developing countries, to identify the most 
active private bankers in those economies. More precisely we find an international division of 
bank lending: UK banks are, for example, much more active in Africa than any others, along with 
some French based banks, while Spanish banks remain attached to Latin America, a region 
where US banks are also heavily involved. In Asia, the leading private lenders are UK based 
banks, followed by US banks. In Eastern Europe, Austrian and German banks dominate lending 
activities, although, after recent mergers and acquisitions operations, Italian and Belgian banks 
are also becoming increasingly heavy players in this region. Other private lenders like Dutch, 
Swedish or Swiss banks have a more global and balanced portfolio. For aid donors willing to develop financing programs with private bank actors, Spanish 
banks would be the natural partners in Latin America, while French or UK banks would be more 
suited for African related projects, as US and UK banks might be in Asia. In Eastern Europe, the 
natural partners would be German and Austrian private banks, along with perhaps Italian and 
Belgian banks. The mapping of private bank lending also helps introduce a more micro-exercise, relating 
to the specific projects already developed by private bankers and aid donors. We identify 
outstanding case studies and best practices, with the objective of underlining the available 
avenues for international cooperation activities in terms of public/private partnerships between 
private banks and aid donors. 26. See presentations by Francisco González, President of BBVA, and Manuel Méndez, President of BBVA

STYLISED FACTS The current trend of increasing financial integration and the opening up of emerging 
countries to capital flows has brought about a sharp increase in foreign bank claims over the past 
decade. This brought private international loans to reach the equivalent to 48.3 per cent of global 
GDP in 2005 27 , more than the total of international trade flows combined with global foreign 
direct investment and tourist receipts (from 32 per cent in 1999 — a jump of more than 
16 percentage points in only half a decade). In real terms, foreign claims in all non-BIS reporting 
countries 
28 rose by more than 120 per cent, while claims in developing countries jumped by more than 100 per cent. Among emerging countries, Latin America and Eastern Europe experienced the biggest 
increase, rising by more than 110 per cent and 165 per cent respectively. It is interesting to note 
that both of these regions are where democratisation and the consolidation of democracy have 
been the most intensive 
29 . 27. The Bank for International Settlements, which monitors the foreign claims held by banks mostly from 
OECD countries vis-à-vis the rest of the world, defines these claims as those authorised by international 
banks on residents outside the country in which they are headquartered. Foreign claims may range 
from assets such as loans, debt securities to equities, including equity stakes in local subsidiaries. 28. There are a total of 40 BIS reporting countries in 2007, i.e. financial centers providing locational banking 
data. Not all OECD countries provide this data (this is the case, for example, of Iceland or Poland). 
Some non-OECD and developing countries like Chile or Brazil do provide this data to the BIS. The 
major non-BIS reporting emerging countries are Argentina, China, Russia, and South Africa. There is no 
BIS reporting country from Africa. 29. For an analysis of the relations between democracy and private bank lending, see Rodríguez and

2005 % Source: based on BIS and IMF This increase in foreign claim flows is due to a number of factors. Financing has the 
advantage of being less restricted than trade, tourism, direct and portfolio investments and 
remittances. For trade and tourism flows, distance is the determining factor: the greater the 
distance between countries, the greater the transaction cost. The situation is similar for 
remittances, which reflect in general migration patterns, which are more based on proximity or 
historical or cultural ties In contrast, foreign claims are not limited either by distance or other limiting factors, and 
therefore have few constraints with regards the destination of funds. The greater dynamism of 
foreign claim flows should also be emphasised in that loans can be granted or received 
immediately, since little information is needed to carry out a transaction and the time required 
for closing such deals is minimal. The reduced time involved favours foreign claim flows, 
compared with trade or direct investments, which require longer periods for closure. Foreign 
claims are also more liquid than other fund flows. In order to define the mapping of private bank lending flows to developing countries, we 
draw on the BIS's "Consolidated Foreign Claims of Reporting Banks on Individual Countries" 
statistical series for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 2006. The BIS 
collates data on the international loans of private banks and deposit organisations worldwide, 
and separates data on domestic loans from foreign loans. Domestic loans are those advanced to 
third persons resident in the country where the bank is based. The BIS does not provide any 
information on these operations. Foreign loans are provided to third persons resident in a different country from the one 
where the bank is based. These foreign claims can also be divided into: i) cross-border positions 
— for example, credits granted by the head office of a Spanish bank to a Mexican organisation — 
and ii) local positions, managed, for example, by a Mexican branch of a Spanish bank. At the 
same time, credits granted by local branches may be divided into those denominated in foreign 
currencies and those denominated in local currency. The concept of Foreign Claims, as 
developed by the BIS, includes all loans granted by one country to another, independent of the 
currency in which they were made and also of where they were granted (either by the head office 
or one of its branches). The BIS periodically publishes this data in their Consolidated Banking OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 17 Statistics as well as what it defines as International Claims, where it only includes foreign currency 
positions, independent of where they were granted 
30 . The 27 countries that report the international operations of their banks and deposit 
institutions to the BIS are: Austria; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Chinese Taipei; Denmark; 
Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong, China; India; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Luxembourg; 
Norway; Panama; the Netherlands; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey, the UK and 
the US. The respective banking authorities of these countries compile the information and send it 
on a quarterly basis to the BIS 31 . A detailed analysis of the data shows that international financing is dominated by a 
limited number of countries. The 27 countries that report to the BIS issue overseas credits 
totalling $23.5 trillion (2006). This is equivalent to approximately 95 per cent of total private 
international loans according to the BIS. There are, however, other countries not included in the 
list of those that report to the BIS which are net issuers of international loans, such as some oil 
exporting countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia). The figures also show that the recipients of 
international loans are strongly concentrated. As well as being the main issuers of international loans, the more developed countries are 
also the main recipients. That is to say, loans are made mainly between developed countries. In 
2006, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the 
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US accounted for 81.5 per cent of the 
total loans issued by the countries that report to the BIS, and in turn received 75 per cent of the 
total. 30. It is possible to argue that when using for this paper the concept of Foreign Claims instead of 
International Claims, we measure the degree of internationalisation of a particular bank in any country, 
as well as the extent of its overseas lending. However, it is impossible to do it in any other way. Most of 
the countries that report to the BIS do not segment their International Claims by country, as is the case 
with Germany or Switzerland. Since these two countries are respectively the leading and third most 
important sources of international financing, any analysis of international flows that is carried out 
without including this data would fail to give a true picture of the situation. It should be pointed out 
that the BIS statistics do not entirely reflect the liabilities incurred among different entities in different 
countries. For example, if a Spanish bank issues debt abroad, it is entered in the statistics. But issues 
carried out in Spain are not reflected in the statistics even though they were mainly taken up, for 
example, by French banks. It is important not to forget that these statistics reflect the activity of private 
entities, which by their nature are more sophisticated and complex than those of the State. For example, 
if a Spanish organisation finances a French company, one could assume that one was dealing with a 
credit flow from Spain to France. But if that credit is backed by guarantees issued by a third-party 
resident in Brazil, what would appear to be exposure to French risk could be transformed under certain 
conditions into Brazilian risk. For each one of these categories, the BIS compiles separate series of 
statistics; such as its "Signed International Syndicated Credit Facilities", "International Debt Securities" and its 
"Amounts Outstanding of Over-The-Counter (OTC) Derivatives ". 31. For more information, see www.bis.org Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 18 © OECD 2007 During the 2000s, European banks have been the main financing organisations 
worldwide. In 2006, Germany, the UK, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands accounted for 
50.6 per cent of loans globally, with Germany the leading lender with 13.4 per cent of total loans 
granted globally. On the other hand, the country that receives most private loans is the US, with 
22.5 per cent of the total. The US is the main recipient of international funds, sourced mainly 
from Europe. The five European countries mentioned above receive 32.9 per cent of total loans. 
They therefore grant more loans than they receive, while the US grants only 5.23 per cent and 
receives 22.5 per cent of the total. Since banks only grant loans when they believe the principal 
and interest charges are recoverable, logic dictates that developed countries be the main 
recipients of credit because of their better risk-return profile and repayment capacity. France is a case of particular interest that deserves some specific attention. It is the major 
source of finance for countries to which the US does not lend, for political or other reasons. In 
2006, France was the principal lender to 37 countries, 20 of which receive no finance from the US 
(out of the 67 countries to which the US does not provide loans). This means that 30 per cent of 
the countries that receive no funding from the US rely on France as their main source of 
financing (down from 40 per cent in 2004). Of the 47 remaining countries to which the US does 
not grant loans, Germany is the main source of funding for 10 of them. In 2006, France and 
Germany together therefore provided finance to approximately 45 per cent of these countries 
(65 per cent in 2004). France and Germany are also an important source of financing for countries that are, or 
have been, on non-friendly terms with the US. In 2006, Germany, for example, was the main 
lender to Syria and Libya, and France to Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Somalia and 
Vietnam. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 19 Tables 1 and 2: France & Germany's Foreign Claims to countries that are non-recipients of US

DIVISION OF LABOUR Several conclusions may be drawn from a detailed study of the destination of bank loans 
to emerging countries. By region, Latin America and the Caribbean were the main recipients of 
private bank flows in the mid-1980s, a phenomenon that has since subsided somewhat. At the 
end of 1984, Latin America and the Caribbean were receiving 47 per cent of the flows to 
emerging countries, while Africa received about 21 per cent, Asia 20 per cent and Europe 12 per 
cent (See Table 1 of Appendix 1). Of all regions Africa has lost out most over the period, as the growth in loans it has 
received has been below the rate of growth in loans to emerging markets as a whole. As a result, 
the percentage of flows to emerging markets received by Africa has fallen over time. There is a 
certain noticeable asymmetry over time between Asia and Latin America regarding the receipt of 
foreign loans. During periods when Latin America's share of financing has fallen, Asia's share 
has grown, and when Latin America has begun to recover, it has been Asia that has lost out. 
Emerging European countries have seen a steady increase in bank inflows, especially from 1996 
onwards. Up until the fourth quarter of 2003, Latin America was the biggest recipient of bank flows 
towards emerging economies. Since the beginning of 2004, Asia is the region receiving the 
biggest share of funding to emerging economies (31.4 per cent of the total in Q1 2006). In 2006, 
Emerging Europe was the second biggest destination for loans to emerging countries with 
31.1 per cent of the total, followed by Latin America with 24.5 per cent, and Africa bringing up 
the rear with only 13 per cent. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 21 Graph 2: Foreign Claims on Emerging Countries (% of total emerging markets) Foreign Claims (% of total of em erging m arkets) 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Q4 1983

This is due mainly to Mexico and Brazil, the two countries in the region that have received the 
biggest share of total loans to emerging markets. In addition, these countries are the individual 
emerging economies that have received the most finance over the past two decades, with flows 
exceeding those directed at Asian emerging economies, although Asia and Emerging Europe as 
regions have obtained more financing than Latin America. This is due to the greater 32. See for a detailed analysis of the determinants and impacts of this boom of foreign bank claims 
Martínez-Pería, Powell and Vladkova-Hollar, 2005. For a very stimulating critic of the pending 
challenges related to financial services in Latin America, see Rojas-Suarez, 2007. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 22 © OECD 2007 concentration of banking flows to a select number of countries in Latin America, compared with 
the wider number of countries in Asia that have received external funding. Mexico and Brazil 
received similar amounts of financing until the second half of the 1990s when Brazil grew in 
importance as a destination for loans, while Mexico decreased. But from 2000 onwards, Mexico 
became the emerging country that received most loans, with 10.5 per cent of the total in 2005 (a 
percentage of total loans similar to that received by Africa and the Middle East in the same year). 
On the other hand, Brazil's importance for banking investment fell considerably after 2002, with 
its share of total emerging bank flows falling from 10.5 per cent at the end of 2001 to a mere 
6.9 per cent in 2006. Other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Venezuela have experienced a 
considerable drop in the amount of financing received from foreign banks. The main winners in 
the wake of the loss of share of the Latin American countries since 2001 (including Mexico) have 
been emerging Asian economies and the Eastern European countries. One may highlight the 
increased importance over the past five years of Chinese Taipei, China, South Korea, India, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (See Table 1 of Appendix 1 and Graphs 4, 5 and 6). Graph 4: Foreign Claims on Latin America & Caribbean (% of total of emerging countries) Foreign Claims on Latin America & Caribbean (% of total of em erging markets) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Q4 1983

country. As noted above, Germany is the leading financing country globally, followed by other 
European economies and Japan, while the US is the biggest worldwide recipient of finance. 
When we observe private bank flows towards emerging countries, we can see that the leading 
financing country is the UK, followed by the US, Germany, Spain, France and the Netherlands. 
When we compare the relative importance of private bank financing at international level and 
private bank financing towards emerging countries, two countries stand out: the US and Spain. 
Both countries are characterised by the fact that they receive loans at an international level 
(mainly from Europe) and simultaneously are major source countries for emerging economies. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 24 © OECD 2007 The US is the second major financer of emerging countries, being the second biggest in 
Asia and Latin America and the fourth largest in Africa. Spain is the fourth biggest lender to 
emerging economies, and is the leading one in Latin America, where it is even bigger than the 
US. However, there are a number of differences between the two. While the US is a big financer 
of emerging economies, it does not assign a high proportion of its total lending to these 
economies. Spain, however, is a major financing country for emerging markets and assigns more 
loans to these economies in relative terms. In addition, Spanish bank loans to emerging countries 
are heavily concentrated in Latin America (95.6 per cent of the total of Spanish bank loans to 
emerging markets) (for a comparison between US and Spanish international foreign claims and 
their determinants see García-Herrero and Martínez-Pería, 2007). Table 4: Main countries of origin of Foreign Claims on Emerging Countries in 2004 and 2006 W orld

22.3 per cent of the total bank funds received. This amount ($857 billion), which is higher than 
Spain's GDP, accounts for 48.8 per cent of Switzerland's total foreign claims. The US in turn is 
the second financer of Asia, although by country it focuses its financing on those that are closest 
to it. It is the main lender to almost all of Central America (Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and 
Honduras), in addition to several islands in the Caribbean (Haiti, Jamaica) and to neighbouring 
Canada. Normally, it is the second or third biggest lender to the rest of the countries bordering or 
geographically close to it (Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad and Tobago). US banks are the main 
financers of only one South American country: Uruguay. (See Table 2 of Appendix 1). The US directs 40.5 per cent of its total private bank emerging market loans towards Latin 
American countries. This level is below the 42.4 per cent that it assigns to Asia, but it is above the 
average of 28.9 per cent that it disburses to all the countries of the world. Its emerging market 
loans are focused on Mexico, which receives 22.7 per cent of the total (See Table 3 of Appendix 1). 
In terms of foreign claims, for example, US banks are also particularly active in Mexico with the 
ratio of US claims to total foreign claims reaching 97 per cent in 2003. Cross-border claims by US 
banks have also been replaced over the past years by claims from US banks, branches and 
subsidiaries located in Latin American countries themselves (Goldberg, 2006). Spain is the major financing country of ten of the thirty Latin American countries that 
appear in BIS statistics. The most important recipients are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. In addition, it is the second biggest lender to Cuba and 
Uruguay. Together, the US and Spain are the leading private bankers of 17 of the 30 countries in 
Latin America. With regards to the remaining thirteen countries in Latin America, Panama's importance 
as the main financer of Costa Rica and Nicaragua merits mention. France is the main lender to 
Cuba and Switzerland is the main banker of Belize and St. Vincent, whilst Germany is the main 
banker of Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands is the main lender to Suriname. The UK and 
Italy are not the main financing countries of any country in Latin America despite being among 
the leading financers of the region. Spain, as has already been indicated, directs 95.6 per cent of its loans towards Latin 
American emerging markets, as underlined by Table 5. It is the highest concentration of bank 
flows in Latin America after Mexico and Panama, with 98.5 per cent and 99.8 per cent, 
respectively. Spanish loans are heavily biased towards Mexico where it grants 48.25 per cent of 
its total loans. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 26 © OECD 2007 Table 5: Main countries of origin of Foreign Claims on Emerging Countries in 2004 and 2006 EM Countries* % of total Greece

goes to economies that are geographically close, share the same language or are former colonies. 
Spain lends mainly to Latin America (ex-colonies and the same language), and to Portugal and 
Andorra (proximity). The US concentrates on nearby and bordering countries in Central 
America, the Caribbean and Canada. The UK is the main lender to Ireland (proximity), Kenya, 
Zimbabwe and India (ex-colonies), and Australia (language) among others. It is the main lender 
to Africa and Asia, and the third to Latin America. In addition, it is almost the leading financer of 
the member countries of the Commonwealth, being the main lender of 50 per cent of the nations 
that make up the bloc. Like Spain and the UK, the countries where France occupies the leading position reflect 
its current international ties, derived to a large extent from its past history. In a similar fashion to 
the Commonwealth, the Francophonie groups together its ex-colonies (and a few other countries). 
It is significant that of the 41 countries where France is the leading lender no fewer than 28 are 
members of this organisation (2004). France is the second biggest lender to Africa and the Middle 
East, where it accounts for 17.6 per cent of the international financing received by these regions. Similarly, Austria and Japan are the top lenders to many of the countries that are 
geographically close to them. Austria is the leader in the European emerging countries (Eastern 
Europe) and the UK in Africa and the Middle East and Asia and Pacific countries. Japan is the 
lead lender of several countries in South and East Asia. Italian banks, because of the recent 
takeovers of German and Austrian entities, are also becoming major players in European 
emerging economies. An interesting exception is Germany, which is a major lender to Eastern 
European countries but also ranks relatively high in terms of lending activity in Asia, Africa and 
Latin America (on foreign direct investment activities by German banks, see Buch and Lipponer, 
2007). Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 28 © OECD 2007 V. SUSTAINABLE BANKING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES As banks have been increasing their exposure to developing countries, both through 
lending activities and foreign direct acquisitions, so have issues of sustainable development 
increasingly come to the fore. For international development banks, this concern has been at the 
core of their activities for many years. It is, however, only more recently that private, both 
commercial and investment, banks around the world are taking on board sustainable 
development issues, particularly in their lending practices. This in turn has led to a much greater awareness of social and environmental issues 
among the companies asking for project finance. Broadly speaking, this has meant more concern 
for protecting environmental goods such as water, air and soil, human rights and social issues. 
Reputation considerations, amid mounting evidence that seeking sustainable lending makes 
sound commercial sense, have been driving this increasing interest (for corporations operating in 
developing countries, see Colonomos and Santiso, 2005). The activism of NGOs and also 
important international actors such as the IFC, the subsidiary and private sector lending arm of 
the World Bank, has played a leading role in increasing the profile of these issues. Activist 
investors have also pressured banks to move away from reputational risks 33 . The growth of 
socially responsible investment funds has also added pressure on banks to account for aspects 
beyond standard financial variables. Bank Sarasin, a private Swiss bank, for example, set up a 
sustainable division in the early 1990s that now manages €2 billion in funds dedicated to 
sustainable investments, targeting banks amongst other corporations. Dexia Asset Management, 
the fund manager arm of Dexia Group, also became increasingly active in the emerging segment 
of socially responsible funds. Yes Bank, which is 20 per cent owned by Rabobank of the Netherlands, actively evaluates 
the social and environmental risks when considering lending operations. While it is a rare 
exception in the Asian banking landscape, Yes Bank also points to a trend of sustainable banking 
in developing countries. Following the trends of their Western peers, Asian banks are 
increasingly making public statements underlining the sustainable development aspect of their 
lending practices. Like their Japanese counterparts, such as Mizuho Corporate Bank, financial 
institutions like South Korea's Kookmin Bank, Woori Bank and Export Import Bank are joining 
initiatives like the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative. 33. See for example, the study Developer by Foreign & Colonial Asset Management, one of the major fund 
managers in emerging markets, F&C Asset Management, Banking on human rights: confronting human 
rights in the financial sector, London, F&C Asset Management, 2004. OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 29 In India, private sector players are also actively involved in socially responsible 
investments. Recently Dutch ABN Amro's Indian asset management arm opened its Sustainable 
Development Fund, a three-year closed-end scheme. The fund will invest in companies that rank 
high on a number of attributes, such as environment compliance and compliance to corporate 
governance rules etc., indicating a high level of social responsibility. Ratings major, CRISIL, will 
establish the ranking based on a set of parameters and review the list annually. Thereafter, ABN 
Amro's fund team will carry out financial analysis of the companies that make the cut for final 
investment decision. Globally those types of funds categorised as socially responsible investment 
(SRI) held over $2.3 trillion in assets in 2006 in the US alone, according to the Social Investment 
Forum 34 , which represented an increase of 260 per cent since 1995, and nearly €1 trillion in 2006 
in Europe, according to Eurosif 35 (for more analysis on SRI developments see Santiso, 2005). 
ABN Amro manages about $2 billion in about 24 SRI funds. The interest for socially responsible 
investments within and towards emerging markets is increasing as suggested by the boom of 
studies dedicated to this asset class of investments (see, for example, Eiris, 2006). Asset management arms, either of banks or specialised institutions, through their 
increasing interest for socially responsible investments, are other potential partners for aid 
donors and/or NGOs willing to boost their impacts in developing countries and on development 
issues. The same applies for pension funds, particularly the public funds and those managing the 
assets of employees working in administrations. In California, Calpers 
36 , an active $230 billion fund manager providing retirement and health benefits for 1.5 million public sector employees, 
deployed over the past decades a remarkable socially responsible strategy, applied not only to 
investments made in developed countries but also in developing countries since the years 2000s. In Europe another public pension fund active in socially responsibility is the Dutch ABP 
Investments, a firm with more than €200 billion of assets under management 37 . Other important 
European public pension funds at the forefront of these issues are AP2 from Sweden or 
Metallrente from Germany. In France the Fonds de Réserve des Retraites also adopted in 2005 
socially responsible investment strategies for part of its €31 billion of assets under management, 
following Calpers' pioneering strategy 38 . Early in 2007, the Spanish public pension system also 
operated a move in the same direction, although limiting its socially responsible investment 
screening to developed countries only. Another promising area is private banking, with certain wealthy individuals now 
pressuring their private bankers not only to provide ethical investment products but also advice 
for investments with  " social performance "  (on private banking see UNEP Finance Initiative, 
2007). Topics at the core of the development agenda, whether poverty reduction, water or climate 
change, has also moved up the agenda of private bankers, investors or insurers (see for example 34. See http://www.socialinvest.org/areas/research/trends/sri_trends_report_2005.pdf. It represents nearly 
9 per cent of the total of assets under management in the US investment funds industry. 35. See http://www.socialinvest.org/areas/research/trends/sri_trends_report_2005.pdf 36. See http://www.calpers.ca.gov/ 37. See http://www.abp.nl/abp/abp/vermogensbeheer_en/ 38.

Citibank, 2007; Lehman Brothers, 2007), along with the increasing awareness of their clients or 
NGOs closed monitoring (see for example the case of French banks and their climate change 
policies, Les Amis de la Terre, 2007; Ethical Corporation, 2006). Private equity and specialised investment companies operating in developing countries 
also hold potential as partners for development. We have seen that some European Development 
Finance Institutions (EDFI), such as UK based CDC or Dutch based FMO, have already 
developed effective partnerships while others are planning to team up with other public or 
private institutions. Recently former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, created an emerging 
markets fund. In 2007, Albright Capital Management and PGGM have come together to create a 
long-term, multi asset class emerging markets fund 39 . PGGM is a Dutch pension fund that serves 
the healthcare and social work sectors, and will serve as Albright Capital's strategic investor with 
$329 million. This initiative follows those of other recent US officials, like Nicholas Brady, the former 
US Treasury Secretary who helped to address the debt crisis of the 1980s by creating the Brady 
Bonds markets for emerging countries in the 1990s. In 1994, after his public career and position 
as Chairman of the investment bank Dillon Read & Co, he established a private equity, fixed 
income and mezzanine finance investment company, Darby Overseas, specialising in developing 
country projects. Nearly ten years later, in October 2003, the company was acquired by Franklin 
Templeton Investments, one of the largest global investment management organisations. The 
company manages nearly $1 billion through different investment vehicles and partnerships 
40 . One year later, another US political senior official, Al Gore, also helped to create an investment 
company (Generation Investment Management) dedicated to long-term sustainable investments, 
with former employees of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Sustainable Asset 
Management. In developing countries, former senior officials have also been playing an active role in 
setting up private equity firms and investment companies. In Brazil, for example, Arminio Fraga, 
a former Central Bank Governor, created one of the most successful investment firms, Gavea 
Investimentos 41 , following the example of Gustavo Franco, also a former Central Bank Governor 
who created Rio Bravo 42 , another investment firm. Some of the private equity firms have already 
reached a critical size in terms of asset under management like, for example, GP Investments 43 . 
Also interesting, Brazilian pension funds, like Previ and Petros among others, have been active in 
the socially responsible investment area, and are supporters of poverty reduction programs like 
the one led by Lula's government Fome Zero 44 . This is also the case of Brazilian private banks like 39. See http://www.albrightcapital.com/ 40. See http://www.darbyoverseas.com/ 41. See http://www.gaveainvest.com.br/ 42. See http://www.riobravo.com.br/ingles/index.asp 43. See http://www.gp.com.br/gp/index_pt.htm 44. See http://www.previ.com.br / ; https://www.petros.com.br/petrossite/ OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 31 Unibanco, Itaú or Bradesco, who, along with public banks or development banks like BNDES 45 , 
are involved in development finance projects all around the country 
46 . In Mexico, Pedro Aspe, a former Minister of Finance, also created a successful investment and consulting firm, Protego, 
specialising in medium size companies 47 . Probably one of the most successful institutions is Fundación Chile, a privately owned, 
non profit institution created in 1976 by the Chilean government and the US multinational ITT 
(in 2005 the mining company BHP Billiton also became a co-founding member and boosted the 
endowment of the institution). This institution pursues innovation, with special emphasis on 
areas like agribusiness, marine resources, forestry, fruit biotechnology, quality management, 
food technologies, etc. The development of the salmon industry is among one of the successes of 
the Foundation. When it targeted that area, salmon exports from Chile barely existed. Now Chile 
is, along with Norway, one of the top exporters of salmon in the world. Private equity and investment firms operating in developing countries are common. It is 
not rare for them to be created by former public officials or former senior officials of leading 
international organisations involved in development 48 . They provide another set of potential 
partners for aid donors willing to catalyse private investment in niche markets where the usual 
bankers and investment firms are not looking. In 2006, private equity firms operating in 
developing countries raised a record of more than $33 billion in capital commitments, a more 
than five-fold increase over the $6 billion raised in 2004 
49 . A firm like the Washington-based Emerging Markets Partners, created in the mid-nineties by former World Bank officers, is one of 
largest private equity firms investing in emerging markets with seven funds holding around 
$6 billion in cumulative capital commitments and investment operations spanning the globe 
from Korea to South Africa to Argentina 50 . In Africa, Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) has been 
the first private equity group to raise more than $1 billion for investment in companies across the 
continent 51 . Major hedge funds and investment companies like Amber Capital, a New York-
based firm, also created in 2007 private equity instruments to invest in developing countries like 45. See http://www.bndes.gov.br/ 46. Unibanco

callous. In Dante's Divine Comedy usurers are consigned within the seventh circle of hell, 
peopled with vengeful Shylocks. Today's bankers and money lenders seem to be working in a 
very different world. Examples abound of the increasing interest in sustainable banking over the 
past years (see for example on Africa AICC Centre for Sustainability Investing, 2004). As 
documented in a related working paper (Javier Rodríguez and Javier Santiso, 2007), private 
banks play a pivotal role in economic development and — more surprisingly — can also lend a 
helping hand in democratic consolidation, with cross border private banking flows tending to 
increase in the years following a democratic transition 54 . As underlined in this paper, private banks are actively involved in developing countries, 
both through their lending activities from headquarters, and now increasingly from emerging 
countries themselves, since they have been heavily investing in their economies, generating 
employment, introducing best practices and many other positive outputs. Banks manage their own performance and sustainability but they are also in a position to 
influence socio-economic and environmental performances in client organisations. Banks' 
lending activities also have an important impact (see Accountability — Institute of Social and 
Ethical Accountability, 2004). This paper stresses a major challenge, going well beyond aid 
coordination: the increasing proliferation of actors, directly or indirectly involved in 
development issues in low or middle income countries. In order to tackle this issue, a deeper dialogue is required between aid donors and these 
private actors. Banks, private equity and asset management firms are part of a much broader set 
of private actors ranging from foundations to corporations. Mapping and coordinating this  " non 54. For a review, based on good practices and case studies, of how financial services are affected by and 
manage the challenges associated with human rights, see also the study of European asset manager 
F&C Asset Management and KPMG, Banking on Human Rights: Confronting Human Rights in the Financial 
Sector, London, September 2004 and the F&C (Isis Asset Management) reports available online: 
http://www.isisam.com/aboutus.asp?pageid=2.8.3.7#banking. All in all, a total of 8 private banks 
voluntarily developed internal human rights policies, standards, guidelines or statements: ABN 
AMRO, Barclays, HBOS, ING, Rabobank, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Westpac. 
Signatories to the UN Global Compact also pledge to avoid complicity in human rights violations. As of 
March 2007, the Global Compact website indicates that 323 banking and insurance institutions are 
members. For a systematic mapping of human rights treaties and norms that could be applied to 
corporations and enforced by States, see the United Nations commissioned report written by the United 
Nations Secretary General's Special Representative on Human Rights & Business John Ruggie, 2007. Banking on Development: Private Banks and Aid Donors in Developing Countries DEV/DOC(2007)6 34 © OECD 2007 system "  of development finance is as challenging as it is important for those seeking to improve 
the lot of less-developed parts of the world (see Mavrotas and Reisen, 2007; and, on the 
fragmentation of aid and private foreign investment, see Harms and Lutz, 2006). Public aid donors who are willing to innovate in order to deepen impacts will find 
interested counterparties and partners. As documented, some of these actors tend to operate by 
specific region. UK and French banks, for example, would seem to be good potential partners for 
aid donors in Africa while Spanish banks or US counterparts might be more relevant for Latin 
America, and German, Swiss 55 and Italian banks for Eastern Europe. Beyond international banks, 
local private banks in India, South Africa, Morocco and other developing countries are also 
potential partners, these banks also being increasingly aware and sensitive to economic, social 
and environmental impacts. In areas like remittances or microfinance, for example, banks operating in both recipient 
countries like Latin America, and also in the sending countries, such as US and Spanish banks 
could have an important role to play in public and private partnerships. In North Africa, French 
players, along with local banks are also key potential partners. In infrastructure finance, whether 
water, health or transport, public aid donors could play a pivotal role as a catalyst for deeper 
involvement by private bankers, equity firms or asset managers in these sectors in developing 
countries. The partnerships can obviously go well beyond solely the banking sector, as underlined 
by the recent initiative of Danone, a French multinational, and the French banking group Crédit 
Agricole, who, in 2007, jointly created a novel mutual to invest in microfinance projects in the 
world's poorest countries. The first test will be in Bangladesh where Danone have already 
created a joint venture with the Grameen Group of Nobel Prize winner Mohammad Yunus, who 
has pioneered microfinance lending to the very poor 56 . Former executives are also creating 
innovative ways to pull financing into microfinance institutions, like Pierre Omidyar, the eBay 
founder, that created Omidyar Network 
57 . In the future, it could be interesting to repeat the current exercise and to map cross-border 
banking operations, either trade finance, bank lending or investment flows, from emerging 
countries to other developing economies. According to The World Bank, development finance is 
experiencing a major transformation as emerging market based banks, companies and 
governments are becoming global heavyweights in international development finance. In 1995, 
low-income country borrowers received a mere 3 per cent of their cross-border syndicated 
lending flows from other emerging market banks. Ten years later that figure jumped to 17 per 
cent. In 2005, a record of 27 per cent of all foreign banks in developing countries were owned by 55. See for example in the field of remittances in the Balkans the analysis conducted by the Swiss State 
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO, 2007). 56. See http://www.grameen-info.org/. More generally, on alliances and partnerships between a public aid 
donor agency and private partners, see US Aid initiatives labeled The Global Development Alliance: 
http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_partnerships/gda/report2006.html 57. See http://www.omidyar.net/ OECD Development Centre Working Paper No. 263 DEV/DOC(2007)6 © OECD 2007 35 banks from other emerging economies. These numbers are particularly important in low income 
countries where 47 per cent of foreign banks in terms of numbers and 27 per cent in terms of 
assets are owned by other foreign banks from developing countries (IMF, 2007). With emerging countries becoming emerging donors, identifying banks operating 
overseas could be a positive dialogue in which to engage, both with  " emerged "  donors and 
international banks. International NGOs such as the Netherlands based BankTrack 58 , involved in 
tracking sustainable bank lending, has already started to address the growing role of emerging 
markets based banks, new power players in development finance. In this regard, more 
systematic analysis could complete BIS efforts to track lending operations from major emerging 
countries' banks, particularly those based in countries like Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India and 
China. Another important issue, related to bank lending in developing countries, are related to 
Basel II rules obliging foreign banks to use risk sensitive models to determine the amount of 
capital to be allocated for different types of borrowers. Many studies have underlined the 
potential negative impacts of such new rules on development finance, private bank lending from 
OECD developed countries to developing countries and private bank lending within the 
developing countries themselves. For these countries, Basel II can raise the costs of and reduce 
access to external financing, inducing more expensive and rationed credit to borrowers perceived 
as higher risk, such as low income countries or small and medium size enterprises. Importantly, 
Basel II may also exacerbate fluctuations in the availability of external financing, an unfortunate 
outcome, given that developing countries already suffer from volatile capital flows 
59 . Stepping up collaboration with private banks might be a way of alleviating the impact of these new 
banking rules for asset allocation, in particular in the lower income countries. It is also important to stress this issue regarding the increasing presence in developing 
countries not only of OECD foreign banks but also of foreign banks from other developing 
countries. According to one estimate, using a large dataset on banking sector foreign direct 
investment in developing countries (Van Horen, 2007; and for the determinants of locations and 
competitive advantages see Claessens and Van Horen, 2007), 27 per cent of all foreign banks in 
developing countries are owned by a bank from another developing country. This presence is 
particularly striking in low income countries: in sub-Saharan Africa it is above all South Asian 
and other sub-Saharan African banks that are present. This is a potential segment of bank 
lending and bank activity within a developing country that could be considered when aid donors 
are looking for public private partnerships in development finance. One might envisage the creation of a Prize in Development Finance that would reward 
best practices of public and private partnerships in the field. The OECD Global Forum on 
Development could host such a prize, as it intends to strengthen the dialogue between aid 
donors and private actors working on development issues and investing in developing countries. 
The objective of the OECD Development Finance Prize would be to underline already existing 58. See http://www.banktrack.org/ 59. Gottschalk and Griffith-Jones, 2006; Powell, 2004; Claessens et al, 2003; Reisen, 2001; and for a

the Financial Times), to stimulate and emulate projects between public aid donors and private 
banks, asset managers and equity firms. Two categories could be created: one for OECD 
institutions and a second for non OECD institutions, thus taking into account the strength of the
