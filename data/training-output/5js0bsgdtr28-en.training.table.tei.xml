            <table>2000 and 2013 the share of 25-64 year-olds with tertiary education grew by 3.1% a<lb/> year on average across OECD countries, while the share of those without an upper secondary<lb/> education fell by 2.9%.<lb/> In 2013, more than 40% of adults still lacked an upper secondary education in five OECD countries.<lb/> Some countries increased their tertiary attainment rates faster than they reduced lower<lb/> educational attainment rates, while others (Poland, Luxembourg, Czech and Slovak Republics,<lb/> and Korea) realised similar tertiary attainment increases but also reduced their below upper<lb/> secondary attainment rates by the same amount.<lb/> In all countries the share of low-skilled adults is lower among younger age groups than among<lb/> older ones, but in some countries more than 20% of adults still have low literacy skills.<lb/> In all countries the distribution of literacy skills is skewed towards the bottom, with a greater<lb/> spread between the median and the bottom 10% than between the median and the top 10%.<lb/> Most analyses of educational attainment rates look at the increases in the share of people with tertiary education, and<lb/> over the past decades OECD countries have witnessed a remarkable growth of such highly educated people. Among<lb/> OECD countries with data for all years between 2000 and 2013, the number of people with tertiary education grew<lb/> by 3.1% on average per year.</table>
