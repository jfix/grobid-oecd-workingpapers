			<head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a need to implement integrated approaches to managing climate risks, bringing together<lb/> climate change adaptation with financial protection. Developing countries are disproportionately affected<lb/> by the rising trend of losses from climate-related extreme events. These losses are projected to continue to<lb/> increase in future, driven by climate change and the accumulation of people and assets in high-risk areas.<lb/> Effective climate change policies are needed to reduce the accumulation of risk, combined with<lb/> instruments and tools to help retain, share or transfer financial losses if an extreme event occurs. These<lb/> tools and instruments, collectively known as financial protection, can help people cope with the impacts of<lb/> climate-related disasters, reduce costs of recovery and reconstruction, and encourage risk reduction.<lb/> Linking financial protection and climate adaptation in development planning and policy has the potential to<lb/> increase the resilience of affected communities.<lb/> Development support providers are increasingly supporting countries&apos; efforts to improve the<lb/> management of climate-related risks with increased funding and new initiatives. These efforts are being<lb/> given further impetus by the Paris Agreement on climate change, Sustainable Development Goals and the<lb/> G7 InsuResilience initiative.<lb/> This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to examine how countries are using financial<lb/> protection as part of their approaches to managing climate risks. The following recommendations for<lb/> development co-operation providers have emerged from this analysis:<lb/></p>

			<p> Expertise from development co-operation providers in gathering, analysing and interpreting data,<lb/> and providing platforms to share knowledge and improve the evidence base can help countries to<lb/> define their financial protection strategies. In Senegal, for example, the creation of a national<lb/> registry of social protection beneficiaries also provides an opportunity to improve the targeting of<lb/> financial protection payments.<lb/></p>

			<p> Technical support for undertaking assessments of the financial impacts of climate-related<lb/> disasters can help create an evidence base that generates political will to improve the<lb/> management of climate-related risks. In Colombia, an analysis of the 2010-2011 La Niña floods<lb/> provided momentum for creating a new system for Disaster Risk Management. This system<lb/> included the creation of a domestic Adaptation Fund, strengthened insurance coverage for new<lb/> road concessions and the creation of a national financial protection strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p> Providers can support key agencies, such as the finance ministry, in designing and implementing<lb/> financial protection tools for climate risks. This includes capacity building, knowledge transfer<lb/> and advisory services, all of which can act as catalysts for change. In Senegal, for example,<lb/> capacity development for the planned Civil Protection Agency could facilitate the streamlining of<lb/> resources, the assessment of gaps, and ultimately lead to a better co-ordinated disaster risk<lb/> reduction policy.<lb/></p>

			<p> Providers should strengthen their in-country co-ordination to avoid duplication of efforts and<lb/> capitalise on their respective areas of expertise. In Colombia, a long-standing partnership<lb/> between the finance ministry, the Swiss Development Co-operation agency and the World Bank,<lb/> with support from other partners, has resulted in a sophisticated financial protection strategy. In<lb/> Senegal, separate programmes led by OXFAM/World Food Programme and USAID are focusing<lb/> on small farmers&apos; resilience to drought and have shared meteorological data to contribute to the<lb/> scaling-up of insurance for poor farmers.<lb/></p>

			<head>1.<lb/> Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial losses from extreme events are continuing to increase, driven in part by the rising<lb/> concentration of people and assets in areas exposed to climate-related disasters. Climate change is already<lb/> starting to change the frequency and severity of some types of extreme events, such as coastal and inland<lb/> flooding and drought. Developing countries are affected disproportionately by this trend (OECD, 2009).<lb/> Despite having contributed relatively little to the problem of climate change, developing countries are<lb/> projected to bear approximately four-fifths of the costs caused by a 2°C increase in average global<lb/> temperature (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2010</ref>). Climate change will increase the scale of losses from extreme climate<lb/> events, but also increase uncertainty about the future. The combination of climate change and rapid socio-<lb/>economic development means that historical information has become less reliable as a guide to<lb/> understanding the risks of future extreme events.<lb/> Climate change and variability contribute to poverty, reducing incomes and increasing the risks faced<lb/> by the poor. The impacts of climate change will be uneven, with the IPCC finding: &quot; the majority of severe<lb/> impacts are projected for urban areas and some rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia &quot;<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Olsson et al, 2014</ref>). Informal settlements in urban areas are often located in risky areas, while the<lb/> buildings in these settlements are highly vulnerable to extreme events. Meanwhile, agricultural incomes are<lb/> extremely sensitive to weather patterns; both are affected by changes such as declining precipitation and<lb/> extreme events such as droughts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ambitious mitigation to reduce the severity of climate change is essential. This should be supported<lb/> by enhanced and co-ordinated action across different policy agendas to address climate-related risks, and<lb/> reduce their impacts on the most vulnerable groups (G20/OECD<ref type="biblio">, 2012; GIZ, 2015</ref>):<lb/>  Disaster risk management and climate change adaptation to tackle the impacts of current climate<lb/> extremes and support the transition to a future climate;<lb/></p>

			<p> Financial protection (the use of financial tools to retain, transfer and share risk) to address the<lb/> financial consequences of risks that materialise.<lb/> This paper uses case studies of Colombia and Senegal to explore how financial protection tools can be<lb/> used as part of an integrated strategy to manage climate-related risks, alongside adaptation and disaster risk<lb/> management. It summarises the emerging lessons from these countries and draws out initial conclusions on<lb/> how development co-operation can best support this process. These case studies are based on interviews<lb/> with government officials and key stakeholders, expert workshops held in each country and desk research.<lb/> The case studies were guided by the following research questions:<lb/>  What are the rationales for and expected outcomes of using climate-related financial protection<lb/> tools, based on experience in the selected countries and/or regions?<lb/></p>

			<p> How are mechanisms for financial protection best placed in a broader set or continuum of<lb/> adaptation and disaster risk management policies within a developing country?<lb/></p>

			<p> Based on experience to date, what does the evidence suggest are the key results, factors driving<lb/> success and remaining challenges for effective integration of financial protection mechanisms?<lb/></p>

			<table> How can financial protection mechanisms influence the incentives of public and private sector<lb/> actors to implement risk reduction measures?<lb/> ENV/WKP(2017)7<lb/>  What evidence has emerged on the role of donors in developing, financing and implementing<lb/> these measures?<lb/> Box 1. Glossary of Key Terms<lb/></table>

			<p>Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems,<lb/> adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human<lb/> intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects<lb/></p>

			<p>Disaster risk management is the systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and<lb/> operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the<lb/> adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection</head>

			<p>is the use of strategies and tools to manage the financial impact of extreme events,<lb/> ensuring adequate capacity to manage and reduce the costs of climate risk, thereby reducing the financial burden and<lb/> economic costs of climate risks and enabling rapid recovery in economic activity<lb/> Resilience is the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or<lb/> trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure,<lb/> while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Risk</head>

			<p>is the combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences if it occurs.<lb/> Vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of<lb/> concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility (or exposure) to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Sources: G20/OECD (2012); IPCC (2014); UNISDR (2009); OECD (2014a).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Even with enhanced adaptation and mitigation efforts, it will not be cost-effective, or even technically<lb/> feasible, to eliminate climate risk (OECD, 2014b). Financial protection tools – such as insurance or social<lb/> protection instruments – have the potential to reduce the vulnerability of people, assets and economies to<lb/> negative shocks. Improving the quality and availability of financial protection tools has benefits both<lb/> before and after an extreme climate event. Before an adverse event, it can increase productivity, as it<lb/> provides more security to pursue more profitable, but riskier, opportunities such as purchasing agricultural<lb/> inputs on credit. After an event, it can help to protect livelihoods by reducing the need to engage in erosive<lb/> coping strategies, such as selling productive assets or withdrawing children from education (Linnerooth-<lb/><ref type="biblio">Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2014; IPCC, 2012</ref>). Box 2 provides evidence of the scale of these ex-post<lb/> benefits at the macroeconomic level.<lb/> Adaptation has the potential to reduce the costs of financial protection by reducing exposure and<lb/> vulnerability to climate-related disaster and slow onset risks. A study examining a number of Caribbean<lb/> countries found that risk reduction measures could cost-effectively avert up to 90% of projected losses in<lb/> 2030 under a high climate change scenario (CCRIF, 2010). Meanwhile, considering adaptation in the<lb/> development of financial protection strategies can make those strategies more effective at managing<lb/> climate risks in the medium and longer term. This provides an opportunity to leverage the growing<lb/> volumes of climate finance and avoid duplication of effort.<lb/> Financial protection measures can support adaptation by encouraging risk reduction, but existing<lb/> mechanisms are not always designed to do so. At a minimum, financial protection can support adaptation<lb/> by not distorting incentives, for example by ensuring that insurance premiums are based on the underlying<lb/> risk. Some initiatives have gone beyond this by integrating financial protection with risk reduction. The R4<lb/> Rural Resilience Initiative in Ethiopia aims to strengthen food and income security by allowing those<lb/> ENV/WKP(2017)7<lb/> insured to partially pay their premiums by engaging in risk reduction activities (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2013</ref>).<lb/> However, these integrated approaches remain unusual, with a survey of flood insurance mechanisms in<lb/> developing countries finding that few of them make a link between risk transfer and risk reduction<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2. Impact of insurance penetration on economic growth<lb/></head>

			<p>Insurance penetration is strongly linked to GDP per capita. In the period between 2005 and 2014,<lb/> insurance covered less than 10% of disaster losses in developing countries, but approximately 51% of all<lb/> losses in high-income countries (OECD, 2015b). Low-income countries have limited insurance uptake due<lb/> to limited financial markets, lack of familiarity with insurance products and high transaction costs relative<lb/> to the sums insured. Traditional insurance mechanisms are not well-suited to the needs of the poorest<lb/> and most vulnerable in managing their exposure to climate risks (Poole, 2014).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Von Peter et al. (2012)</ref> analysed a panel dataset covering 203 countries and territories between<lb/> 1960 and 2011 to identify the impact of natural catastrophes on economic growth. They find that insured<lb/> events do not affect long-term output (i.e., GDP growth does not diverge significantly from its pre-disaster<lb/> trend), while uninsured events create a cumulated loss in output over 10 years of 2.3% or more<lb/> (see below).<lb/> Note: The left-side panels show the deviation of real economic growth from its trend due to a typical disaster event for<lb/> an economy with no private insurance coverage and an economy with full insurance coverage. The right-side panels<lb/> show the cumulative deviation of GDP from trend over 10 years for each type of economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even when financial protection succeeds in encouraging people to reduce risks relating to climate<lb/> variability, this does not necessarily mean that it is good for adaptation. Climate change means that the risk<lb/> profile will change over time, but financial protection tends to focus attention on the management of<lb/> current risks. For example, insurance premiums only reflect current risk exposure. This can be a problem if<lb/> measures to address current risks increase vulnerability in the longer term. For example, inappropriate<lb/> reforestation can deplete groundwater supplies (IEG, 2012). The creation of fixed flood defences in some<lb/> ENV/WKP(2017)7<lb/> areas may ultimately increase vulnerability by encouraging development in places that will be unsuitable<lb/> under a changed climate.<lb/> In practice, developing countries are at an early stage in considering how financial protection can be<lb/> linked with adaptation planning. As an illustration, out of a sample of 18 national adaptation plans or<lb/> strategies, 10 countries mentioned the use of financial tools to manage exposure to disaster risks 1 .<lb/> However, all but one of these was narrowly focussed on the use of agricultural insurance rather than<lb/> financial protection more generally. The two policy agendas tend to be managed by different areas of<lb/> government, with the environment ministry often leading the work on adaptation and the financial<lb/> protection strategy being led by the finance ministry. These administrative divides at the national level also<lb/> extend to the international level, where they are governed by separate processes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bilateral and multilateral development agencies are already playing important roles in providing<lb/> financial resources, capacity building and technical assistance to support financial protection and climate<lb/> change adaptation. Development co-operation providers have increased their support to climate change<lb/> adaptation in the past years, reaching almost USD 19 billion in 2014 (OECD, 2016a). They have also<lb/> contributed to financial protection initiatives, ranging from sovereign risk pools such as the African Risk<lb/> Capacity (ARC) 2 and the Caribbean Climate Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) to mechanisms targeting<lb/> households, such as the R4 Rural Resilience Initiative. The G7 InsuResilience initiative aims to increase<lb/> coverage by 400 million people by 2020. This initiative provides financial support for mechanisms<lb/> including ARC and CCRIF However, despite the progress made to date, development agencies&apos;<lb/> engagement in financial protection is still in the &quot; early days &quot; (<ref type="biblio">Poole, 2014</ref>). There is, therefore, scope for<lb/> enhanced co-operation to strengthen resilience against climate risks, through better-integrated support for<lb/> financial protection and climate adaptation.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.<lb/> Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>Analysis of public finance flows provides an indication of the degree of integration between climate<lb/> change adaptation and disaster risk management. It is not currently possible to track public finance for<lb/> financial protection.<lb/> Development co-operation providers are supporting both disaster risk management and adaptation<lb/> efforts in developing countries. Data from the OECD Development Assistance Committee&apos;s (DAC)<lb/> Creditor Reporting System (CRS) provides an indication of trends in this support, including the degree of<lb/> integration between policy agendas. The DAC CRS provides data on all support from DAC members<lb/> down to the level of individual activities. The Rio Marker on Adaptation identifies activities within that<lb/> database for which adaptation was either the principal or a significant motivation for undertaking the<lb/> project or programme. It now also includes activity level data reported by multilateral development banks<lb/> and climate funds for 2013 and 2014 (<ref type="biblio">MDBs. 2015)</ref> 3 .<lb/></formula>

			<p>There is, however, no equivalent marker to identify expenditure on the management of natural<lb/> hazards, including those related to climate change. Instead, spending allocated to sectors linked to disaster<lb/> risk management can provide an indication of trends in levels of support. The CRS sector classifications<lb/> chosen for this report are: disaster prevention and preparedness, flood prevention and protection, and<lb/> reconstruction relief and rehabilitation (collectively, the DRM sectors). These sectors were chosen because<lb/> they are most likely to capture relevant activities.<lb/> Identifying and delineating relevant finance streams is an evolving challenge. Methodological<lb/> difficulties and data gaps mean that the estimates below should be treated as indicative, with further<lb/> research needed to provide a more detailed picture. For example, projects that aim at financing resilience<lb/> to climate risks may be captured under a range of different sectors, including health, education, or water<lb/> management, rather than the sectors linked to disaster risk management. Given that activities to help<lb/> address climate-related risks may fit under different sector codes, a detailed analysis at the activity level<lb/> would be required to capture all relevant flows.<lb/></p>

			<head>Integration of adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>The analysis below provides an estimate of resources targeting the DRM sectors that were also<lb/> designed with an adaptation objective, acknowledging that not all relevant activities might be identified.<lb/> The methodology used for this purpose analyses the share of finance flowing to the three key disaster risk<lb/> management sectors (identified above) that are also &quot; marked &quot; as climate change adaptation, from both<lb/> bilateral and multilateral providers.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is more overlap between adaptation and DRM expenditure by multilateral donors, than is the<lb/> case for bilateral donors. On average, bilateral providers have allocated USD 10 billion per year between<lb/> 2010 and 2014 in adaptation-related ODA commitments, from which USD 580 million per year were<lb/> directed to the three key disaster risk management sectors (5.7% of the total adaptation-related resources).<lb/> By comparison, multilateral providers have provided an average of USD 5 billion per year between 2013<lb/> and 2014 for adaptation, of which USD 1.35 billion per year (24%) supported the same key sectors. While<lb/> adaptation-related disaster risk prevention and preparedness resources from bilateral providers slightly<lb/> decreased between 2013 and 2014, they increased for flood prevention and control, and more so for<lb/> reconstruction, relief and rehabilitation. For multilaterals, amounts increased between the two years<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).<lb/></p>

Although the results are very heterogeneous among the providers, flood protection and control is the<lb/> most integrated, with 93% of projects marked as adaptation-related between 2010 and 2014. Of all finance<lb/> flowing to disaster prevention and preparedness, 37% was marked as adaptation-related while for<lb/> reconstruction relief and rehabilitation, 23% 4 was marked as adaptation. For bilateral providers 66% of the<lb/> resources are provided in form of grants and 34% in form of loans. For multilateral providers 96% of the<lb/> adaptation-related resources in the key sectors are in form of loans and only 4% are provided as grants.<lb/> Bilateral and multilateral providers are heavily concentrated, with Japan being the most active by providing<lb/> over 52% of the resources, followed by the EU institutions and Germany. Among the multilateral<lb/> providers, the World Bank Group is dominant, accounting for 89% of the resource flows.<lb/></p>

			<p>This analysis of adaptation-related finance in the DRM sectors only provides a general indication of<lb/> the degree of integration of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management development finance<lb/> flows. To provide an in depth-analysis, the project-level data of activities recorded in the DAC CRS for<lb/> Colombia and Senegal were examined to identify adaptation expenditure linked to disaster resilience<lb/> objectives. Specifically, a keyword search was undertaken to identify relevant activities within the whole<lb/> set of adaptation finance, across all sectors. The keywords were: risk, resilience, catastrophes, insurance,<lb/> and disaster. The results of this search are discussed in their respective case studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Limited evidence on domestic resource flows<lb/></head>

			<p>Domestic resources will be essential for managing the risks that arise from climate change, but few<lb/> countries track these finance flows. All countries were requested to provide information on their<lb/> expenditure on disaster risk management within their Hyogo Framework progress reports. However, few<lb/> have done so, while the lack of a common methodology means that results are not comparable between<lb/> countries. There is even less data available on domestic expenditure on adaptation, although some country<lb/> studies have shed light on this issue. For example, a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review<lb/> (CPEIR) of Bangladesh found that 4% of government spending was linked to climate adaptation in 2014<lb/> (UNDP, n.d.).<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Kellet et al (2014)</ref> examines efforts in disaster risk reduction finance across five countries (Indonesia,<lb/> the Philippines, Mexico, South Africa and Costa Rica). Based on this, and a literature review, it concludes<lb/> that very little comparable evidence can be found and more research is needed in this area. Examples<lb/> where data are available include the Philippines where standalone projects totalling USD 800 million were<lb/> recorded and Indonesia with USD 900 million of recorded projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>These tools work most effectively as part of integrated strategies to reduce risks, which combine<lb/> appropriate mixes of financial protection tools (GFDRR, 2014a). For example, social protection<lb/> programmes for poor households create liabilities for the government, which can then be offset using tools<lb/> such as sovereign insurance (World Bank, 2016b). In that example, the existence of social protection<lb/> programmes enables the benefits of improved management of sovereign financial liabilities to flow to the<lb/> households who need them most.<lb/> Providers, in collaboration with governments, private sector insurers and farmers&apos;, among others,<lb/> have an essential role to play in supporting the development of individual tools, as well as the development<lb/> of overall strategies. At the project level, modalities have included technical assistance and direct financial<lb/> support to cover setup costs and thereby improve affordability. Providers can also indirectly facilitate these<lb/> mechanisms through support for reforms to strengthen the regulatory and policy environment, improve<lb/> provision of weather data, or expand access to financial services. At the strategic level, donors&apos; technical<lb/> support, financial resources and convening power can support integrated approaches to managing<lb/> climate risks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection against climate risks for national governments<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial protection at the sovereign level is based on the principle of risk layering, with different<lb/> combinations of tools used depending on the potential size of losses. Risk reduction is used to prevent the<lb/> occurrence of very frequently occurring events. As the scale of losses increases, risks are retained and then<lb/> transferred. The largest, least frequent events cannot be fully managed ex ante. Instead, they are met<lb/> through ex post mechanisms such as budget reallocation, tax increases and international humanitarian<lb/> relief (OECD/G20, 2012). The layering principle is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> below.<lb/> Strategies for financial protection can help to assess and manage climate risks, reducing the need for<lb/> unplanned, emergency funding that may arrive late or in insufficient quantity. An illustration of the limits<lb/> of emergency funding is provided by <ref type="biblio">Becerra et al. (2012)</ref>. They find that the average flow of ODA to<lb/> affected countries increases by 18% after a disaster, but this increase only covers on average 3% of total<lb/> estimated damages from that disaster.<lb/></p>

			<p>Contingency funds, or dedicated budgets for disasters, are a commonly used mechanism for retaining<lb/> risks. They are best suited for the financial management of frequently occurring, but low-impact events<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Mechler, 2005</ref>). This is important given that these events can have large cumulative impacts on people&apos;s<lb/> livelihoods, even if they are small when viewed in isolation. Countries that have adopted contingency<lb/> funds for climate risks have also taken measures to insulate the resources from political pressure for<lb/> reallocation. These include moving the fund out of the main budget, with the provision of a clear legal<lb/> framework for how those funds can be used (<ref type="biblio">Phaup &amp; Kirschner, 2010</ref>). For example, the budget allocated<lb/> to Mexico&apos;s FONDEN operates as a separate trust. When losses exceed the allocated budget, the additional<lb/> costs can be met from ex post measures (e.g. additional taxes, budget reallocation) or through the other<lb/> financial protection instruments described below.<lb/></p>

			<p>Development co-operation providers have pioneered the use of prearranged credit lines to provide<lb/> rapid access to funding following an extreme event. This is a form of risk retention, as the credit has to be<lb/> repaid. Contingent credit lines can be arranged in advance, maintained for a small fee and then made<lb/> available when a specific event occurs (such as a national declaration of a state of emergency). Examples<lb/> include the World Bank&apos;s Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO), IADB&apos;s Contingent Credit<lb/> Facility for Natural Disaster Emergencies and JICA&apos;S SECURE programme (GFDRR, 2014a). One of the<lb/> main benefits of these credit lines is that resources are available almost immediately following the<lb/> triggering event and are usually provided at more favourable terms than commercial loans. They can also<lb/> serve as an incentive for improved planning, as countries are required to have a risk management plan in<lb/> place as a condition for eligibility. Even credit lines that are small relative to the scale of potential losses<lb/> from disasters can help to cover immediate costs, while longer-term arrangements are made. Pre-existing<lb/> credit lines to manage disaster risks have been used in countries including Colombia, Costa Rica,<lb/> Guatemala, the Philippines and the Seychelles. However, they are only suitable for countries with<lb/> sufficient fiscal space to take on additional debt. As such, they may not be suitable for low income<lb/> countries.<lb/> Risk transfer instruments, such as insurance, can provide a valuable tool for managing the<lb/> consequences of less-frequent but larger events. These are particularly relevant in developing countries,<lb/> where the government&apos;s assets and revenues tend to be limited and concentrated, and where losses can be<lb/> much larger in proportion to GDP. The use of formal risk transfer arrangements also increases<lb/> transparency, as the covered liabilities become visible as budgetary outlays. Provided that premiums are<lb/> linked to the underlying risks, the benefits of investments in risk reduction also become visible. Lastly,<lb/> there is the potential to benefit from the third-party&apos;s expertise in risk management.<lb/> Insurance of public sector assets, such as buildings, is mandatory in many developing countries,<lb/> although this does not necessarily translate into adequate or effective cover. Beyond the insurance of<lb/> specific assets, sovereign-level instruments can provide resources to manage a broader range of risks.<lb/> Governments can purchase reinsurance from international markets to address the consequences of extreme<lb/> events. For example, the Costa Rican government combines self-insurance of public assets with a<lb/> reinsurance contract to cover the risk of unlikely, but high cost events (<ref type="biblio">Ghesquiere and Mahul, 2010</ref>).<lb/> Insurance can be provided on the basis of actual losses (indemnity) or if a specified event occurs<lb/> (parametric insurance). Parametric insurance is quicker to disburse and avoids moral hazard, but has the<lb/> downside that the payment received may not be closely correlated with the losses incurred.<lb/></p>

			<p>Countries can also diversify their exposure to extreme events through risk pooling. The pool takes on<lb/> the risk profile of the region, combining individual risks into a calculable risk for the group. This enables<lb/> governments affected by a disaster to rapidly access finance that will enable them to start recovery efforts<lb/> (Linerooth-<ref type="biblio">Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2014</ref>). Risk pools can be designed to encourage investment in<lb/> risk reduction and ensure their own financial sustainability. The use of a parametric trigger avoids the risk<lb/> of moral hazard because the payment received does not depend on the size of the loss. Current risk pools<lb/> have proactive mechanisms in place to develop capacity for risk management by the pool&apos;s members.<lb/> Reinsurance is used to manage the possibility that the pool is exhausted because too many countries are<lb/> eligible for payments in one year.<lb/></p>

			<p>Catastrophe bonds transfer risks to capital markets, providing an alternative or complement to the use<lb/> of reinsurance. These bonds are generally issued by companies, but are slowly expanding to sovereign<lb/> issuers. In essence, these bonds pay investors an above market return, but if a pre-defined event (e.g.<lb/> measured by a parametric threshold such wind speed or rainfall) occurs the investor will lose either the<lb/> interest, or the interest and the principal from the bond (<ref type="biblio">Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer, 2011</ref>). The<lb/> implementation of catastrophe bonds requires sophisticated capacity and good data, which limits their<lb/> application to higher-income countries. In 2012, Mexico launched a USD 315 million catastrophe bond<lb/> that provides coverage against earthquakes and hurricanes, building on the success of the 2009 MultiCat<lb/> Mexico transaction. The Pacific Alliance (Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Peru) countries are currently<lb/> developing a catastrophe bond, initially for earthquake risk but with the potential to extend coverage to<lb/> other hazards.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection against climate risks for the private sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial protection tools can help businesses to manage their exposure to climate risks, including<lb/> damage to buildings and business disruption. Agricultural insurance is a particularly important tool in the<lb/> context of climate change. The specific challenges faced by smallholders and subsistence farmers are<lb/> addressed in the following section on households.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the absence of financial risk management measures, farmers manage their exposure to climate and<lb/> market risk by limiting the use of purchased inputs and diversifying production to include crops that are<lb/> less climate-sensitive (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2016</ref>). In principle, the availability of insurance should provide more<lb/> efficient means of managing these risks. For example, insured farmers may use more credit for agricultural<lb/> inputs (such as fertiliser or improved seeds), as they are more confident about being able to repay the loan<lb/> in the event of unfavourable growing conditions. They can also maximise average output by specialising in<lb/> their most productive crop.<lb/> However, the uptake of commercial, indemnity-based (i.e. payouts are made on the basis of actual<lb/> losses incurred) agricultural insurance is very low in developing countries. In general, only the largest<lb/> farms purchase cover. In Peru, for example, only 0.7% of cultivated land is covered by commercial<lb/> insurance (GIZ, 2016). In contrast, 43% of German agricultural land is covered by commercial insurance<lb/> on an unsubsidised basis (<ref type="biblio">Diez-Caneja et al, 2009</ref>). The underlying reason for low penetration in<lb/> developing countries is that the comparatively small size of insured sums and proportionately high<lb/> administration costs for processing claims. A further constraint is that the potential for moral hazard means<lb/> that some risks, such as pest damage, are not insurable (<ref type="biblio">Hazell, 1992</ref>).<lb/> Index-linked insurance is increasingly being used to overcome these challenges and expand coverage<lb/> to small and medium-sized farms. The largest of these is the India&apos;s National Agricultural Insurance<lb/> Scheme (NAIS), which provides coverage to 25 million farmers (<ref type="biblio">Mahul et al., 2012</ref>). In addition to this<lb/> large-scale programme, there are a large number of smaller initiatives. The IFC&apos;s Global Index Insurance<lb/> Facility, largely focussed on agricultural insurance, has supported insurance for 600 000 people. These<lb/> programmes have provided valuable insights, but total coverage remains limited.<lb/> A continuing challenge with index-linked insurance has been basis risk, which is the possibility that<lb/> the payments received by the policyholder do not match the losses that they have incurred. This can be<lb/> desirable, if it rewards farmers who have undertaken measures to reduce risks. However, in general, the<lb/> existence of basis risk makes the insurance less attractive, because potential customers are less certain that<lb/> their losses will be covered. Pilot programmes can be used to address the two underlying causes of basis<lb/> risk: weaknesses in product design and insufficiently detailed weather data (IFC, n.d.). Careful design of<lb/> the index can help to calibrate payments to potential losses. Technological innovation, in particular the use<lb/> of remote sensing, has potential to provide geographically detailed information in the absence of weather<lb/> stations (<ref type="biblio">Hochrainer-Stigler et al, 2014</ref>).<lb/> Development co-operation providers are increasingly focussing on supporting the basic financial<lb/> market infrastructure for insurance rather than providing subsidies. Improvements in the market<lb/> infrastructure can then help to expand coverage and bring down the cost of insurance. Methods include<lb/> data collection, regulatory reforms and client education and outreach (GFDRR, 2011a). Subsidies can help<lb/> to increase coverage, but even heavily subsidised programmes can struggle to achieve scale. Moreover, the<lb/> payment of subsidises can distort production decisions and create significant costs for governments and<lb/> donors. Any subsidies need to be carefully design and complemented with other types of support.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection against climate risks for poorer households and the informal sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Poor households often have limited ability to reduce their vulnerability to climate risks. For example,<lb/> they may lack the resources to invest in risk-reduction measures, such as raising their dwellings to reduce<lb/> flood risk. Even in good years, this vulnerability slows the advance towards higher income, which is a key<lb/> determinant of adaptive capacity. In bad years, the lack of mechanisms to address extreme events can lead<lb/> to a negative cycle, as households are forced into taking measures that ultimately erode their earning<lb/> potential. Governments, with the support of donors, can support resilience by improving the variety,<lb/> quality and suitability of instruments available for managing climate risks. A major international initiative<lb/> on this is detailed in Box 3. Social protection is particularly important tool for supporting poorer<lb/> household&apos;s capacity to manage the financial consequences of extreme events (World Bank 2016b).<lb/> Micro-insurance has been developed to meet the needs of households by offering coverage for small<lb/> amounts of losses at low premiums. Providers of micro-insurance aim to keep costs down through<lb/> innovations in the cover offered, the delivery channels used or the use of technology (e.g. mobile<lb/> payments). Pilots of index-based micro-insurance providing low-income households with financial<lb/> coverage for climate risks have been carried out in Bolivia, Malawi, India, Mongolia, Sudan, and Ethiopia,<lb/> among others (<ref type="biblio">Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 3. The G7 InsuResilience Initiative<lb/></head>

			<p>The G7 Climate Risk Insurance Initiative (InsuResilience) was launched at the G7 summit in Elmau in June 2015,<lb/> highlighting the importance of financial risk transfer concepts, particularly for emerging and developing countries. The<lb/> initiative aims to increase coverage of both direct and indirect insurance for climate risks for over 400 million people in<lb/> developing countries by 2020. At COP22 in November 2016, the G7 countries increased their commitment to<lb/> USD 550 million (up from the USD 420 million announced at COP21) of public funds. This funding is enabling the<lb/> delivery of a rapid action package, which includes support for ARC, CCRIF and the rollout of a Pacific Catastrophe<lb/> Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the short term, InsuResilience focusses on expanding and capitalizing existing indirect insurance facilities and<lb/> initiatives such as the African Risk Capacity (ARC), the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment &amp; Financing Initiative<lb/> (PCRAFI) and the Caribbean and Central American Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). The initiative plans<lb/> on expanding its coverage of countries and products over time. In the medium to long term, the focus will shift to<lb/> providing direct insurance and working closely with the private sector. GIZ and KfW, under the mandate of BMZ, are<lb/> playing a leading role in promoting this initiative, in close collaboration with Munich Re. GIZ is establishing a secretariat<lb/> to accelerate the implementation of the Initiative, under the framework of their program on Disaster Risk Reduction and<lb/> Adaptation to Climate Change.<lb/></p>

			<p>Experience gained from implementing insurance programmes to date has revealed some significant<lb/> challenges in expanding coverage (<ref type="biblio">Wolfrom and Yokoi-Arai, 2015; Surminski and Oramas-Dorta, 2013;<lb/> Surminski et al, 2015</ref>):<lb/></p>

			<p> Coverage of insurance for climate risks remains low among developing countries and,<lb/> particularly, vulnerable groups within those countries.<lb/>  Affordability remains a challenge for particularly vulnerable groups of people, with the<lb/> expansion of coverage being constrained by the availability of domestic and external public<lb/> funding.<lb/></p>

			<p> Micro-insurance for climate risks has yet to demonstrate commercial viability, with extension of<lb/> coverage dependent upon availability of external resources.<lb/>  Reducing basis risk 5 remains a challenge with index-linked products, particularly where weather<lb/> data is patchy or incomplete.<lb/>  Links with proactive risk reduction remain weak in many insurance mechanisms in developing<lb/> countries.<lb/></p>

			<p> Pilot programmes often have to address the lack of basic market infrastructure for insurance, such<lb/> as data to help set premiums, payment systems and raising awareness about the value of<lb/> insurance.<lb/></p>

			<p>Insurance is only one potential element of a risk management strategy. Social protection measures<lb/> encompass a range of mechanisms that transfer income or assets to the poor, including cash transfers, asset<lb/> transfers, public works schemes and input subsidies (<ref type="biblio">Bene et al., 2014</ref>). In contrast to insurance, eligibility<lb/> for social protection is based on need, rather than the payment of a premium. Social protection<lb/> programmes can work in concert with insurance provision: for example, in Kenya, there is a layered<lb/> system for farmers, which provides social protection for the most vulnerable farmers, subsidised premiums<lb/> for poorer farmers and unsubsidised insurance for those with higher incomes (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2015</ref>).<lb/> Sufficient, targeted and scalable social protection can help poor and vulnerable households to manage<lb/> their exposure to climate risks without having to engage in erosive coping strategies (<ref type="biblio">Davies et al, 2009</ref>). It<lb/> can strengthen resilience over time by improving households&apos; adaptive capacity and preventing them from<lb/> falling into poverty. <ref type="biblio">Heltberg et al (2009)</ref> emphasise the value of having mechanisms in place to quickly<lb/> adjust coverage of existing mechanisms, so that the assistance can flow to the people and areas affected.<lb/> This can be achieved through the development of socio-economic registers, which allow recipients to be<lb/> readily identified following a disaster. Works programmes can use self-targeting, where the payment of a<lb/> below-market wage restricts participation to those otherwise unable to find employment<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2016b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>More generally, development interventions to support financial inclusion have the potential to<lb/> reinforce people&apos;s ability to manage climate risks. Savings, borrowing and remittances are widely used<lb/> strategies for managing exposure. For example, when Agrawala and Carraro (2010) analysed micro-<lb/>finance portfolios in Bangladesh, they found that 70% of the borrowing was related to climate change<lb/> adaptation. Meanwhile, mobile payment mechanisms have been found to reduce transaction costs, and also<lb/> support households&apos; ability to share risks (CGAP, 2014).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.<lb/> Colombia case study<lb/></head>

			<p>The 2010-2011 La Niña floods led to significant reforms to the management of natural hazards in<lb/> Colombia. The floods caused damages of USD 6 billion and affected 3.2 million people nationally, while<lb/> some regions experienced losses equivalent to 15% of their GDP (ECLAC, 2012). It resulted in<lb/> strengthened efforts to reduce the drivers of risk, improve financial management and adapt to climate<lb/> change.<lb/> Although this event was extreme, it occurred against a backdrop of rising recorded losses over time<lb/> and growth in the underlying drivers of vulnerability. Colombia&apos;s geography leaves it highly exposed to<lb/> climate-related hazards, including floods and landslides. This is compounded by deep-seated socio-<lb/>economic challenges, including high income inequality: in 2013, average GDP per capita was just over<lb/> USD 8 000, but 6% of the population were living on less than USD 1.90 (PPP) per day<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2016a</ref>). Armed conflict has weakened state capacities in some regions, and driven people<lb/> from rural areas to informal urban settlements in risk prone areas. In addition, environmental degradation,<lb/> including persistent, large scale deforestation is contributing to the severity of extreme events, increasing<lb/> their impacts on people and infrastructure.<lb/> Shortcomings in the design and implementation of land-use planning instruments rendered them<lb/> ineffective in stemming the accumulation of vulnerability. The World Bank (2012a) estimates that 12% of<lb/> the population live in areas that are highly exposed to flood risk. Meanwhile, there has been a lack of<lb/> resources for investment in risk reduction, particularly in small, remote or less developed municipalities.<lb/> Other major policy challenges have included capacity constraints, the pressure of accommodating<lb/> displaced populations and misalignments between administrative boundaries and natural borders.<lb/></p>

			<p>The weather in Colombia is heavily influenced by the La Niña / El Niño cycle. During a La Niña<lb/> event, increased rainfall is mainly associated with floods and landslides, which in turn can lead to crop<lb/> failure, livestock losses, food shortages, increased vector-borne diseases, respiratory diseases, and food and<lb/> water borne diseases. El Niño by contrast creates a water deficit, which in conditions of vulnerability can<lb/> be translated into drought, reduced access to potable water, increased food and water-borne diseases,<lb/> diarrheal diseases, land degradation and desertification, food shortages, and forest fires (<ref type="biblio">Bello, 2011</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Climate change is projected to affect weather trends in Colombia. Based on historical weather data,<lb/> IDEAM has identified the following broad trends arising from climate change from this cycle (DNP, 2012;<lb/> IDEAM, 2012; IDEAM, 2015): rising temperatures, increased precipitation and shrinking glaciers. In the<lb/> future, temperatures are projected to continue increasing. Precipitation will decrease in the Caribbean and<lb/> Andean regions and increase in the central and northern Pacific region. One study suggests that the<lb/> likelihood of extreme El Niño events will increase in the future due to climate change (Cai et al, 2014).<lb/> Many studies have been conducted on the economic and social impacts of climate change in<lb/> Colombia, predominantly on an ad hoc basis. The most influential at the national level has been a joint<lb/> study on the Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Colombia (DNP-BID<ref type="biblio">, 2014</ref>). This was developed by<lb/> the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), Colombia&apos;s Department of<lb/> National Planning (DNP) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). This examined some of the<lb/> most climate-sensitive sectors (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and transport), which combined<lb/> accounted for 4.3% of Colombia&apos;s GDP in 2005-2012. The impacts of climate change in these sectors were<lb/> projected to reduce Colombia&apos;s total GDP by an average of 0.5% per year. In addition to these studies, a<lb/> national vulnerability analysis, including detail at the departmental scale, is being produced as part of the<lb/> 3 rd National Communication to the UNFCCC. This is intended to improve consistency and set a benchmark<lb/> for more detailed studies.<lb/> Although these general trends have been identified, Colombia currently lacks the historical data<lb/> needed to comprehensively understand and manage climate risks. Coverage of weather data is uneven,<lb/> with the best coverage being available in the Andean and Caribbean regions, which is where the bulk of<lb/> people and assets are located. A study by the state Fund for Financing the Agricultural Sector<lb/> (FINAGRO, 2015a) found that only two of Colombia&apos;s 32 departments have sufficient meteorological and<lb/> hydrological data coverage (more than 1 station for every 100km 2 of territory) to offer catastrophe<lb/> insurance for agriculture. The government is increasing coverage of weather stations, assisted in part by<lb/> investments through the Colombian Adaptation Fund. This should help to improve coverage in currently<lb/> underserved areas. This will not be a quick fix, however, as several decades of historical weather data are<lb/> required to identify the underlying trends in climate. In the meantime, improved coverage could yield near-<lb/>term benefits such as facilitating the introduction of index-based insurance and the development of early-<lb/>warning systems.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to gaps in the available weather data, there is also incomplete data on the impacts of<lb/> extreme events. The national system for recording information on disasters (SIGPAD) has been reinforced<lb/> with support from the World Bank, but has yet to achieve complete sectoral and geographical coverage. A<lb/> particular challenge lies with recording of data on smaller but more frequent events, with relevant<lb/> information either not recorded or not consolidated into the system. These smaller events are<lb/> predominantly related to landslides and flooding. Although their individual impacts may appear small, the<lb/> cumulative impact is substantial. The current data cover the period between 1970 and 2010 and estimate<lb/> almost USD 3 billion in losses. 6 Primary research, such as analysing newspaper archives, is being used to<lb/> provide a more complete picture of historical trends, including the most recent La Niña events. A common<lb/> proxy for the estimation of losses has been to use data from the housing sector, where the majority of<lb/> losses are reported.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional and policy framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The overall framework for managing climate risks is provided by Colombia&apos;s National Development<lb/> Plans, the National Adaptation Plan and the National Risk Management Plan. The National Development<lb/> Plans are used to set priorities and guide the allocation of resources for each presidential term. The Plans<lb/> are developed by the National Planning Department, working together with each sector, and then<lb/> implemented as laws. Although there is an increased emphasis on integration in these documents, the<lb/> institutional arrangements for managing climate risks are not closely linked in practice.<lb/></p>

			<p>Colombia&apos;s approach to climate change is coordinated through the National Climate Change System<lb/> (SISCLIMA). This was proposed in 2011 and operated in an ad-hoc way prior to being formally approved<lb/> by decree in February 2016. This system includes a set of institutional mechanisms for strengthening<lb/> coordination between sectors at the national level, in addition to the regional level. Some of the key<lb/> elements that were in operation even prior to formal approval include the committees on financial<lb/> management and international affairs, which have been facilitating coordination between the relevant<lb/> ministries. At the regional level, the ministry of environment has a coordination mechanism to bring<lb/> together relevant actors. The new formal structure incorporates these elements, but is intended to be<lb/> streamlined and made more operational compared to that proposed in the 2011 document.<lb/> Colombia has taken an unusual route in the development of its national adaptation plan, which is<lb/> known as the PNACC. Instead of having a single document that sets out a top-down approach, the PNACC<lb/> is conceived as a toolbox to support local and sectoral adaptation actions (<ref type="biblio">DNP et al, 2012</ref>). The toolbox<lb/> consists of the general principles for adaptation, combined with technical guidance. This reflects the vital<lb/> importance of territorial land planning tools, such as the Territorial Management Plans (POTs), in reducing<lb/> vulnerability. Nonetheless, having produced the toolbox, the Colombian government is now producing a<lb/> single overview document that will set out its overall national approach to adaptation.<lb/> In addition, the government is currently exploring whether to introduce a climate change law. At<lb/> present, the system is based on the SISCLIMA decree and the government programmes set out in the<lb/> national development plans. Implementation relies heavily upon voluntary initiatives, supported by the<lb/> toolbox provided by the PNACC. The motivation for introducing legislation would be to provide a<lb/> legislative basis for adaptation actions, potentially including economic instruments or regulatory reforms.<lb/> It would also help to increase the clarity and perceived permanence of the system.<lb/> Disaster risk management has a more established legal basis in Colombia than adaptation. The Law<lb/> 1523 of 2012 provides the current framework, which establishes that risk management is the responsibility<lb/> of all actors in society. It contributed to the National System for Disaster Risk Management (SNGRD in<lb/> Spanish), which brings together relevant actors to understand, reduce and address the impacts of disasters.<lb/> It includes a legal requirement for central and local government to assess the risks of disasters under their<lb/> remit. This framework is designed to address some of the underlying drivers of risk discussed in the<lb/> previous section. In particular, there is now a requirement that disaster risk management be mainstreamed<lb/> into development, territorial (POTs), coastal (POMIUAC) and water basin management plans (POMCAs).<lb/> This requirement applies to municipalities, which are responsible for developing POTs, and the regional<lb/> level, which covers POMCAs and POMIUACs. The requirement for disaster risk to be considered in<lb/> development plans is particularly significant, as these plans affect spending decisions. Moreover,<lb/> departments and municipalities with a population larger than 250 000 inhabitants must have a risk<lb/> management entity. However, the implementation of these requirements remains limited.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Following the 2010-11 floods, the Finance Ministry (MHCP) issued a Disaster Risk Finance and<lb/> Insurance (DRFI) policy strategy in 2013, which established a guiding framework for implementing a<lb/> three-pronged approach to managing the fiscal consequences of natural disasters. The elements of this are:<lb/> 1. Improving the evidence base on the fiscal consequences of natural disasters<lb/> 2. Developing a comprehensive strategy for the financial management of natural disasters<lb/> 3. Insuring public assets against catastrophic risks<lb/></figure>

			<p>These elements have been supplemented by capacity building at the central and sub-national level.<lb/> Additionally, a long-term operative plan will support implementation of the DRFI policy strategy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The national development plan and the Law 1523 of 2012 make the connection explicit between<lb/> relevant policy areas, but in practice the coordination among the institutions and the sharing of data could<lb/> be improved. The environment ministry and finance ministries are starting to explore how financial<lb/> protection can facilitate and support the adaptation process. This will entail better integrating the relevant<lb/> institutions, developing shared conceptual understandings and concretely examining the implications of<lb/> specific policies for adaptation. The development of the adaptation strategy for the finance sector would<lb/> provide an opportunity to move this agenda forward. Meanwhile, the long-term operative plan for the<lb/> Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategy also provides an opportunity to better coordinate with<lb/> adaptation policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>Analysis of finance flows can shed light on overall trends and the degree of integration between<lb/> relevant policy agendas, but there are significant data limitations and methodological challenges in doing<lb/> so. This section aims at providing an overview of finance targeting the management of climate risks using<lb/> available data both from the Colombian government for domestic flows and from the DAC CRS for<lb/> international flows from development co-operation providers.<lb/></p>

			<head>International financial resources for adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>The amount of bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) directed to adaptation in Colombia<lb/> increased from 2010 to 2014, when it reached USD 117 million (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The share of ODA marked<lb/> as principally adaptation, implying activities designed with the primary objective of contributing to the<lb/> adaptation to climate change in the country, has shown great variability, with principal activities<lb/> accounting for 84% of the total in 2014 but only 20% of bilateral adaptation-related ODA in 2011.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Adaptation related ODA of DAC members in Colombia (2010-2014)<lb/> Source: Authors with data from DAC CRS.<lb/> The largest bilateral provider of funding is France, followed by Spain, the United States and<lb/> Switzerland (OECD-DAC CRS 2016). The largest multilateral providers, according to the OECD DAC&apos;s<lb/> CRS are the Inter-American development Bank (IDB) and the international Adaptation Fund established<lb/> under the UNFCCC. However, very few projects have been reported as targeting adaptation in Colombia<lb/> from multilateral sources since 2013. Notably, the World Bank&apos;s Development Policy Loan linked to<lb/> natural disasters is not included, although this is likely to support climate adaptation by addressing the<lb/> underlying drivers of exposure to climate risks.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A keyword search of project descriptions 7 provides an indication of how much of the finance<lb/> committed to adaptation was directly linked to disaster risk management and might not be contained in the<lb/> three disaster-related sectors 8 . The detailed word search shows that USD 6.9 million of activities between<lb/> 2010 and 2014 were targeting adaptation and financial protection objectives from bilateral sources. For<lb/> multilateral providers, the activity level search showed that the three projects were included in the key<lb/> sectors (USD 89 million). However, some potentially relevant projects were not marked as adaptation<lb/> (including the Cat DDO and associated measures), which suggests that examination of all development<lb/> finance flows may identify some additional projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Use of domestic resources to fund disaster risk management and adaptation measures: national and<lb/> subnational level<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, public spending on climate change (including mitigation) and DRM was approximately<lb/> USD 660 million in 2013, growing from approximately USD 490 million in 2011. This rise can be<lb/> explained by the increase in risk prevention activities implemented by municipalities in 2013. From this<lb/> 7 Development finance data for Colombia were examined in depth by performing a detailed activity-level keyword<lb/> search across the activities marked with the adaptation marker. The keywords used were &quot; disaster risk &quot; , &quot; resilience &quot; ,<lb/> &quot; insurance &quot; , &quot; flood &quot; , &quot; natural disaster| both in Spanish and English.<lb/></p>

			<figure>8 These sectors are: Disaster prevention and preparedness, flood prevention and protection, and reconstruction relief<lb/> and rehabilitation<lb/> 5%<lb/> 4%<lb/> 12%<lb/> 5%<lb/> 10%<lb/> 0<lb/> 20<lb/> 40<lb/> 60<lb/> 80<lb/> 100<lb/> 120<lb/> 140<lb/> 2010<lb/> 2011<lb/> 2012<lb/> 2013<lb/> 2014<lb/> USD<lb/> million<lb/> Principal<lb/> Significant<lb/> Share of adaptation of total ODA<lb/></figure>

			<p>amount, 58% was dedicated to adaptation. The main actors in financing climate change-related investments<lb/> are the municipalities (43%), followed by the Environmental Regional Authorities. The national budget<lb/> accounts for only 12% of total expenditure in this area. In terms of sectoral investments, the largest<lb/> categories receiving public resources for climate change investments were environment and sustainable<lb/> development (66%), risk management (30%) (including only adaptation-related investments and not<lb/> regular DRM projects or reconstruction projects), mining and energy (0.12%), housing (0.55%) and<lb/> agriculture and pasture (4%). For the territories, there are several possible uses of the potentially allocable<lb/> resources for purposes of environmental conservation and climate change. These resources include those<lb/> for drinking water and basic sanitation, as well as freely allocable resources.<lb/> Investment in disaster risk management primarily takes place at the national and regional levels. In<lb/> the period 2006 – 2014, planned investment in disaster risk management at national level amounted to<lb/> USD 7 billion, which represented 1% of total national government investment (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Colombia, 2015</ref>). From this amount, 2% was targeted to knowledge activities, 9% for risk reduction and<lb/> 90% for risk management.</p>

			<figure>Municipalities spent USD 10 billion in this area albeit over a longer time period<lb/> (2002 to 2014), while departments invested a further USD 1 billion.<lb/> Figure 4. Allocation of national disaster risk management budget across strategic objectives<lb/> Source: adapted from UNGRD (2015).<lb/> During this time, a La Niña event in 2010-2011 led to reforms of the disaster financing system,<lb/> including the creation of the domestic Adaptation Fund in 2010. This was established to identify, develop<lb/> and manage projects in the areas affected by La Niña. However, the Fund has subsequently been given a<lb/> stronger emphasis on prevention and will serve as a source of public funding for designing and<lb/> 0.5%<lb/> 0.4%<lb/> 89.0%<lb/> 7.6%<lb/> 2.5%<lb/> Improve knowledge of risks<lb/> Reduce the accumulation of<lb/> new risks<lb/> Reduce existing exposure to<lb/> risks<lb/> Guarantee timely and<lb/> adequate disaster<lb/> management<lb/></figure>

			<p>Strengthen governance,<lb/> education and communication<lb/> on risk management<lb/> implementing DRM and adaptation projects. This will strengthen the National System for Disaster Risk<lb/> Management and environmental policies and climate change management.<lb/> The National Disaster Risk Management Plan has a budget of USD 3.5 billion for the period from<lb/> 2015-2025, with approximately 87% dedicated to risk reduction activities of current risks. These activities<lb/> include financial protection and inclusion of climate change adaptation into territorial and sectorial<lb/> planning (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). During the interviews conducted for this case study, it was stressed by several<lb/> stakeholders that most of the resources are directed towards reaction, leaving too little for prevention<lb/> activities and resilience building projects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection instruments being used in Colombia<lb/></head>

			<p>Colombia uses a wide spectrum of tools to manage its financial exposure to climate-related risks.<lb/> Some of these support households directly, while others can indirectly support households&apos; resilience by<lb/> supporting the ability of businesses and the public sector to manage risk. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the range of<lb/> instruments being implemented in Colombia.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sovereign level<lb/></head>

			<p>Colombia&apos;s Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategy aims to ensure that the government has<lb/> the option of responding promptly to losses, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal balance.<lb/> Analysis by the finance ministry shows that the average direct exposure to natural hazards, including<lb/> earthquakes, is USD 490 million per year (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2012a</ref>). However, there is significant tail risk,<lb/> with the costs of a 1 in 100 year event estimated at USD 3 billion under current climate conditions (1.2%<lb/> of GDP) (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2012a</ref>). Separate analysis by ECLAC shows that climate change could result in<lb/> impacts on the scale of the 2010-2011 flooding becoming a regular event, but this has yet to be<lb/> incorporated into the modelling of financial exposure.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial consequences of extreme events are managed by the finance ministry as part of its remit<lb/> of managing contingent liabilities 9 . This type of institutional structure is recommended by the OECD&apos;s<lb/> Recommendation on Disaster Financing Strategies, as the finance ministry has oversight and influence<lb/> over spending decisions across government ministries. This system is underpinned by the legal<lb/> requirement for public entities to account for their exposure to contingent risks (MHCP, 2012). Previously,<lb/> the focus had been on the management of explicit liabilities, which are those resulting from legal<lb/> requirements or contractual provisions, such as debt guarantees. However, it is being expanded to cover the<lb/> management of implicit &quot; passive &quot; liabilities, such as losses from natural catastrophes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial protection strategy is focussed on the management of potential central government<lb/> financial liabilities. The management of local government liabilities does not fall directly under this<lb/> system, but some aspects are addressed in the national law for disaster risk management (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Colombia, 2012</ref>). There is, however, no policy for managing the financial consequences of extreme events<lb/> for households or businesses, for example by encouraging the use of insurance. However, some of the<lb/> measures in this strategy – such as improving data availability – may have ancillary benefits beyond the<lb/> central government. Additionally, the insurance guidelines generated for central government are being<lb/> communicated to local governments.<lb/> Strengthening data on the potential fiscal consequences of disasters is viewed as a prerequisite for<lb/> their effective management. A major gap that this strategy intends to fill is the lack of data on assets owned<lb/> by the government, their exposure to disaster risk and the existence of insurance coverage. There is<lb/> currently a pilot programme using a web-based system to create and maintain a comprehensive inventory<lb/> of public assets, insurance policies and incurred claims.<lb/></p>

			<p>The other aspect of improving the evidence base is to improve understanding of the costs of previous<lb/> events, and use modelling to examine how these could evolve in future. This is important for developing<lb/> the strategy, raising awareness of the potential risks that it will be managing and increasing the feasibility<lb/> of specific instruments. In general, poor information on risk equates to expensive premiums or coverage<lb/> not being available. Insurers, or other third parties, will be wary about assuming uncertain risks. As a<lb/> consequence, improvements in data can lead to cheaper premiums.<lb/> A remaining challenge for this strategy is to strengthen the links between risk reduction and financial<lb/> protection, building on progress to date. The World Bank has supported an integrated approach to this<lb/> issue through its technical and financial support. The first contingent credit (USD 150 million) was<lb/> packaged with a broader set of measures (USD 260 million) aiming to strengthen the management of<lb/> disaster risks. These risk reduction measures included:<lb/>  Supporting the development of 688 municipal risk reduction plans<lb/>  Technical support to underpin the production of</p>

			<head>15 POMCAs and 25 POTs<lb/></head>

			<p> Assistance with the development of risk maps and support for disaster information<lb/> Law 1523 of 2012 requires the three government levels (national, departmental and municipal) in the<lb/> country to formulate, implement and evaluate Disaster Risk Management Plans to orient, prioritise and<lb/> focus initiatives and investments to diminish vulnerability in territories against natural disasters.<lb/> Departments and municipalities are also required to create Disaster Risk Management Funds to finance and<lb/> implement disaster risk management processes (knowledge reduction and management of disaster risks).<lb/> Currently, 91% of departments have formulated plans and 78% of municipalities have created plans. All of<lb/> the departments and 64% of the municipalities have created disaster risk management funds. The<lb/> legislation does not, however, define the size of these funds.<lb/></p>

			<p>The financial protection strategy is comprehensive, ranging from frequent low-severity events to rare<lb/> but high impact events. It consists of a layered approach to managing the financial consequences of natural<lb/> disasters, which is consistent with good practice in this area (G20/OECD, 2012). The underlying principle<lb/> is for the government to retain smaller and more frequent losses. Losses from rarer, but larger events are<lb/> transferred to the private sector or international partners. Very extreme events are not cost-effective to<lb/> transfer, so they would have to be absorbed through ex-post measures. In practice, however, the system is<lb/> more nuanced than this, as the characteristics of each tranche (e.g. data required, risks covered and speed<lb/> of payment) also need to be considered. These layers are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. Multi-layer risk financing strategy for natural disasters<lb/> Source: Ministry of Finance (2013).<lb/></figure>

			<p>These layers are now being put in place, with the aim of creating a portfolio of instruments that<lb/> matches both the scale of losses, and the timing of disbursements relative to needs (response, recovery, and<lb/> reconstruction phases), taking into account a cost benefit evaluation. The resources from these layers are<lb/> brought together into a single account, called &quot; Colombia Humanitaria &quot; . This subaccount included<lb/> resources from different budgets, such as the national budget, the liquidity obtained from the Cat DDO,<lb/> department and municipal budgets, as well as external donations from cooperation agencies<lb/> (MHCP, 2012).<lb/> The base layer of the system is provided by the National Fund for Disaster Risk Management, created<lb/> by Law 1523 in 2012. The resources for this fund are provided from general taxation. The majority of its<lb/> USD 166 million annual funding is for addressing the consequences of disasters, but 9% is being allocated<lb/> to risk reduction (UNGRD, 2015). Since June 2015, the fund has been part of the National System of<lb/> Disaster Risk Management and it now may structure and execute comprehensive projects for risk reduction<lb/> and adaptation to climate change. This is intended to strengthen the disaster risk management system and<lb/> help reduce fiscal vulnerability of the state.<lb/> Colombia has arranged a series of contingent credits with the World Bank. The risk ultimately<lb/> remains with the government, but this instrument provides greater flexibility and immediate access to<lb/> resources in the aftermath of a disaster. This helps to avoid the need for disruptive, emergency budget<lb/> reassignments. The first Cat DDO (Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option) was approved in 2008 for<lb/> USD 150 million, replacing a previous contingent credit. The essence of this instrument is that the<lb/> Colombian government could rapidly borrow up to that ceiling following the declaration of a national<lb/> natural disaster. This occurred at the end of 2010, when the full value of the Cat DDO was accessed to<lb/> address immediate needs following the floods. In a subsequent evaluation, the World Bank (2012b) noted<lb/> that one of the Cat DDO&apos;s benefits was that it helped to reassure financial markets and the population that<lb/> the situation was under control. Following the positive experience with the first Cat DDO, the Colombian<lb/> government has subscribed to a new Cat DDO for USD 250 million in 2012. This instrument is currently<lb/> active until 2018, but can be extended up to a maximum of 15 years.<lb/> The Cat DDO directly contributes to the management of current climate variability, but also makes an<lb/> indirect contribution to longer-term climate change adaptation. This is because countries are required to<lb/> adopt measures to reduce disaster risk as a condition of having access to this loan and these measures will<lb/> have long-term benefits. In Colombia, a key benefit should arise from the measures to redirect<lb/> development away from high risk areas, which will lead to long term benefits. The Cat DDO is also<lb/> accompanied by improvements in data collection, which should assist with planning over the time horizons<lb/> relevant for climate change.<lb/></p>

			<head>Insurance of public assets and PPPs<lb/></head>

			<p>Public bodies are legally required to insure their assets against catastrophe risk, with the aim of<lb/> reducing the government&apos;s exposure to disaster risks and supporting fiscal management. However, an<lb/> insurance diagnosis for 23 public entities at central level showed that implementation of this requirement<lb/> could be improved. It has been implemented in a decentralised manner, without guidelines, with each<lb/> public body responsible for meeting its own requirements. As a consequence, there was no central<lb/> oversight of the coverage and adequacy of insurance policies, meaning that the government&apos;s total fiscal<lb/> exposure was unclear (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2012a</ref>). Furthermore, the piecemeal purchase of insurance coverage<lb/> prevented the government from benefitting from economies of scale and risk diversification in the public<lb/> sector estate.<lb/></p>

			<p>Initial steps have been taken to improve the transparency and quality of public sector insurance in the<lb/> public estate. A pilot web platform managed by the Federation of Insurance Companies (FASECOLDA)<lb/> has been created to collect systematic data on the availability of public sector assets, insurance policies and<lb/> claims, but this is still at an early stage. In the meantime, the finance ministry has negotiated access to the<lb/> insurance companies&apos; datasets, albeit under restrictive conditions that were agreed to safeguard commercial<lb/> sensitivity. The other step taken to improve coverage has been the gradual development of standardised<lb/> insurance contracts for public assets, with standard guidance being produced to inform the development of<lb/> insurance contracts.<lb/> Insurance arrangements for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are being strengthened. With each<lb/> successive set of transport concessions, the aim has been to shift more of the risks to the operators on the<lb/> basis that they are best placed to manage those risks. This was given further urgency when the 2010-2011<lb/> floods revealed weaknesses in the previous allocation of risks between parties. Risks that had been<lb/> contractually allocated to the concessionaires were ultimately assumed by the government, because the<lb/> scale of the losses and the need to build back better meant that it was no longer commercially viable to<lb/> continue with the contract. Concessionaires have to hold sufficient insurance to cover their expected<lb/> Probable Maximum Loss. The insurance policies are renewed every five years, with the risk of future<lb/> premium increases being held by the concessionaire.<lb/></p>

			<head>Catastrophe bond<lb/></head>

			<p>Colombia is working with the other Pacific Alliance countries (Mexico, Peru and Chile) to develop a<lb/> catastrophe bond. This will initially be for earthquake risk, but with a view to covering other hazards in the<lb/> future. However, the finance ministry is currently analysing the business case for transferring (instead of<lb/> retaining) weather risks via this bond, given the high exposure of Colombia to hydro-meteorological<lb/> hazards. The projected frequency of covered events will be critical, as this instrument is best suited to<lb/> manage infrequently occurring events.<lb/></p>

			<head>Private sector<lb/></head>

			<p>The role of the private sector&apos;s participation in adaptation and risk reduction activities is multiple: it is<lb/> both a provider of financial protection and a potential beneficiary. The private sector is also supporting the<lb/> development of innovative technologies to improve early warning systems, data quality and data usage for<lb/> risk reduction purposes.<lb/> Experience with insurance has been mixed: a major focus has been on improving the transfer of risks<lb/> from the government to the insurance industry. However, experience in the agricultural sector has<lb/> illustrated the difficulty of transferring risks from the private sector to insurers. The Colombian<lb/> Government included the goal of implementing risk management instruments (market and climate risk)<lb/> under the Agricultural Policy pillar of the National Development Plan. The agriculture ministry has<lb/> introduced a series of instruments and strategies, both in risk prevention and mitigation as well as in risk<lb/> transfer (MINAGRO, 2016). The ministry, recognising the importance of protecting farmers from the<lb/> impacts of climate change, subsidises premium costs up to 80%, depending on the size of the producer.<lb/> Coverage has increased from 30 000 hectares in 2009 to 187 000 hectares in 2015. However, this still only<lb/> represents 3% of the total agricultural land area. The insurance (Seguro Agropecuario) covers natural risks<lb/> such as excess or deficit rainfall, high winds, floods, frost, hailstorms, landslides and avalanches; and<lb/> biological risks such as pests or diseases.<lb/></p>

			<p>The insurance product, as well as the incentive for rural capitalisation that fosters sustainable and<lb/> resilience investments for farmers (Incentivo a la Capitalizacion Rural, ICR) is part of an integral strategy<lb/> to reduce, prevent and manage the impacts of natural disaster risk. This includes an Agriculture Risk<lb/> Information System, which is jointly managed by the agriculture ministry, the Rural Agriculture Planning<lb/> Unit (UPRA) and the Agricultural Financing Fund (FINAGRO), as well as technical support programmes<lb/> to provide financial education to farmers. Outputs include short-term forecasts on climate and guidance on<lb/> what crops are most suitable for different types of land, as well as a pilot project for an early warning<lb/> agroclimatic system. UPRA is also developing maps to help target production subsidies to the most<lb/> suitable crops in certain areas. It is also providing guidance to farmers to help them make better-informed<lb/> decisions about managing climate risks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household level<lb/></head>

			<p>Colombia is not strongly equipped with mechanisms for the financial protection of households against<lb/> natural disasters. For example, uptake of insurance of private assets is slow, and limited to higher income<lb/> households. Analysis by FASECOLDA showed that only 7% of the asset losses from the 2010-2011 La<lb/> Niña were covered by insurance (OECD, 2014). There are several reasons for that: (i) lack of awareness<lb/> about financial protection mechanisms; (ii) lack of products targeted to the most vulnerable populations,<lb/> who are usually the most impacted by disasters; and (iii) a perception that the government will &quot; take care &quot;<lb/> of the disaster, paying for the recovery and relocation costs. This perception arises from the Colombian<lb/> constitution, which sets out a number of areas in which the government is obliged to provide<lb/> compensation.<lb/> The Program &quot; Familias en Accion &quot; is a conditional cash transfer programme that enables vulnerable<lb/> households to receive direct cash transfers to spend on education and health services. The programme is<lb/> designed to break the poverty cycle and improve vulnerable populations&apos; resilience, empowering women to<lb/> be the ones taking the decisions and leading the provision of care in the household. The potential links with<lb/> disaster risk reduction activities are strong. However, there has not been any experience in adjusting the<lb/> resources of the programme to extend to resilience building activities in the context of extreme climatic<lb/> events.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.<lb/> Senegal case study<lb/></head>

			<p>Senegal&apos;s ecosystems, economy and society are highly vulnerable to climate change. The main<lb/> climate hazards posing a threat to the country are: increasing temperatures and erratic precipitation causing<lb/> drought, higher incidence of pluvial flooding and related health epidemics. Senegal is also vulnerable to<lb/> sea-level rise, coastal flooding and coastal erosion. Approximately one-fifth of Senegal&apos;s coastline is<lb/> highly vulnerable to flooding. Coastal storms and other extreme events from the sea damage people&apos;s<lb/> livelihoods. These hazards, particularly droughts and flooding, are already causing repeated losses and<lb/> decreasing people&apos;s resilience, especially for the most vulnerable.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Senegal suffers from the effects of both two much and too little water. Droughts have been occurring<lb/> sporadically for several decades in Senegal, with eight severe droughts having occurred since 1977. The<lb/> drought in 2011 led to a decrease in grain production of 20% and groundnut production of 31%, exposing<lb/> around 800 000 people to food insecurity. Most of those affected depended on agriculture for their<lb/> subsistence. Droughts have been a key driver for migration from rural to urban areas (GFDRR, 2010). At<lb/> the same time, floods are a frequent occurrence in Senegal, and have affected around 400 000 to 600 000<lb/> people per year on average between 1980 and 2008 (GFDRR, 2014b). These floods are caused by heavy<lb/> rains making rivers overflow or accumulating on impermeable surfaces and causing damages in urban<lb/> areas such as Dakar and Kaolack. Storm surges also lead to salt-water intrusion into agricultural lands,<lb/> particularly in the Saloum Delta near the river Gambia.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Urban flooding is a particular challenge in Senegal, as the effects of uncontrolled urban growth are<lb/> exacerbated by the lack of a functional storm water drainage system. There is widespread non-compliance<lb/> with the urban planning and development master plan. The long dry period from 1980 to 1990 favoured the<lb/> installation of a part of the growing population in low-level areas that were vulnerable to flooding. This<lb/> development reduced the soil infiltration potential, leading to increased flood risk in the main Senegalese<lb/> cities. In 2014, around 76% of urban areas were classified as unplanned settlements (GFDRR, 2014b). In<lb/> 2009, torrential rainfalls caused USD 82 million of losses nationwide, predominantly in the Dakar region<lb/> (GFDRR, 2014b).<lb/> Senegal&apos;s adaptive capacity is limited by high poverty levels. Senegal is classified as a Low Income<lb/> Country (LIC), and its GNI per capita has been stable at around USD 1 000 since 2010 (World Bank,<lb/> 2016a). 10 In 2010, 57% of people in rural areas were recorded as living below the national poverty line<lb/> compared to 33% in urban areas (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2016a</ref>). The economic structure of Senegal is heavily<lb/> dependent on rain fed agriculture and fisheries, both heavily affected by climate change and natural<lb/> disasters. Agriculture supports the livelihoods of 60% of the Senegalese and employs three quarters of the<lb/> workforce, with family farms representing 95% of the sector&apos;s activity (MEDD, 2016). Fisheries are the<lb/> second most important source of employment and livelihoods in Senegal, but fish stocks are already<lb/> affected by overfishing (UNDP, 2004).<lb/></p>

			<head>Current and projected impacts of climate change, including on physical conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>Climate change has affected precipitation and temperature in Senegal. Sahelian rainfall is<lb/> characterised by high variability on inter‐annual and inter‐decadal timescales, which can make long‐term<lb/> trends difficult to identify. Nonetheless, Senegal has experienced a statistically significant decrease of 10<lb/> to 15 mm per decade in wet season rainfall between 1960 and 2006, with the 500 mm isohyet 11 moving<lb/> about 100 km to the south (GFDRR, 2011). Mean temperatures in Senegal have risen by 0.9°C since 1960<lb/> (ibid) and mean rainfall volume has decreased by 30% since 1950 (MEDD, 2016).<lb/> Future climate change is projected to lead to a hotter, drier climate. Mean annual temperatures are<lb/> projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 4.9°C by the 2090s, with warming projected<lb/> to be faster in the interior than in those areas closer to the coast (<ref type="biblio">McSweeney et al., 2008</ref>). Different<lb/> models project a wide range of changes in the mean annual rainfall averaged over the country, from ‐41 to<lb/> +48% by the 2090s, but the majority of models show decreases and it is likely that a greater proportion of<lb/> precipitation will occur in heavy rainfall events (ibid). Projected increases in sea level will put pressure on<lb/> coastal areas, especially in the southern region and in Cape Verde. Senegal&apos;s 700 km coastline is already<lb/> retreating at a rate of 1-2 meters every year due to sea-level rise and increased intensity of storms and<lb/> waves. If the sea level rises by one meter by 2100, between 55 and 85 km 2 of beaches would disappear<lb/> and around 6 000 km 2 of low-lying areas would be exposed to coastal flooding, notably the estuaries<lb/> (GFDRR, 2011). A projected increase in coastal urbanisation (+15% over 2005-2030) could worsen this<lb/> situation, with 75% of Senegal&apos;s coastline being at high risk of erosion by 2080 (<ref type="biblio">Egis Eau, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Development co-operation providers have supported several climate vulnerability studies of Senegal.<lb/> Studies have focused on coastal areas (<ref type="biblio">World Bank, 2013</ref>), food security (<ref type="biblio">Funk et al., 2012</ref>) and eastern<lb/> Senegal (USAID, 2014). These found that low-input rain fed agriculture will be hit hardest by climate<lb/> change, with yields in the 2080s decreasing by nearly 50% for sorghum and millet. The yield of high-input<lb/> rain fed agriculture will decrease more moderately, between 2-3% in the 2020s up to 15-40% in the 2080s<lb/> depending on the type of crop (GFDRR, 2011). The impact of climate change on cattle is missing from<lb/> many studies, despite its importance for the animal sector (IFPRI, 2014). Rising sea levels may also<lb/> increase saline intrusion of groundwater basins and affect the quality of water supplies (IED<lb/> Afrique, 2015).<lb/> Insufficient mapping of current and projected risks, particularly regarding flooding and coastal<lb/> erosion is an obstacle to disaster risk and adaptation planning. The environment ministry has announced its<lb/> intention to address this issue following the destruction of 200 houses by coastal storms around Dakar in<lb/> 2015. The ministry will host the Observation Mission of the West African Coastline within its Ecological<lb/> Monitoring Centre (CSE). The observatory is supported by the International Union for Conservation of<lb/> Nature and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and will involve eleven of the Union&apos;s<lb/> member countries. The scope of the mission has yet to be defined, but the Global Fund for Disaster Risk<lb/> Reduction has identified a number of areas where further analysis would be valuable: higher-resolution<lb/> segmentation of the coastline, including improved elevation and sea-level measurements, coastal<lb/> geomorphology and understanding of sediment loads (GFDRR, 2011). The data and research gathered by<lb/> this institution would complement the existing sources of climate information in Senegal: the National<lb/> Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology (ANACIM), and the CSE. Both of these institutes currently<lb/> focus on agrometeorological information, monitoring rainfall, vegetation cover, wildfires, hydrological and<lb/> agricultural data, using satellite imagery and field observations.<lb/> Data on the impacts of natural catastrophes are not routinely collected by the Senegalese<lb/> administration, but are instead estimated through ad-hoc projects funded by development providers. For<lb/> example, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) assessed the human and<lb/> economic impact of the 2009 urban floods. This lack of systematic collection makes it more difficult to<lb/> qualify the economic attractiveness of alternatives to the &quot; business as usual &quot; management of disaster risk.<lb/></p>

			<head>Institutional and policy framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Senegal&apos;s management of climate-related risks is covered by three ministries. The environment<lb/> ministry is in charge of planning for climate adaptation and accessing international climate funds through<lb/> the accredited Ecological Monitoring Centre, the interior ministry is responsible for disaster risk<lb/> management and the finance ministry coordinates the country&apos;s participation in insurance mechanisms at<lb/> the national and local level. Sectoral adaptation policies are also implemented by the relevant ministries,<lb/> such as the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Equipment, Fisheries, Livestock and Farming, or dedicated<lb/> agencies such as the National Council for Food Security and the Commission for Food Security (CSA).<lb/> The institutional structure at the national level contains several advisory bodies, but their respective<lb/> mandates and roles are not always clearly defined. The field of risk and disaster management, for instance,<lb/> formally has four advisory bodies established under the authority of the prime minister or interior ministry:<lb/> the High Commission of Civil Protection, the National Platform for Reduction of Major Disaster Risks, a<lb/> National Unit for Flood Prevention and a National Committee on Flood Prevention, Supervision and<lb/> Monitoring (<ref type="biblio">Political Champions Group, 2013; GFDRR, 2014</ref>). Despite the creation of coordinating<lb/> groups such as the National Committee for Climate Adaptation or the Research, Planning and Monitoring<lb/> Committee, the different policy areas operate largely in isolation from one another, with different<lb/> governance and funding frameworks. The creation of a presidential council to tackle the impacts of floods<lb/> in 2012 added an additional layer of complexity to the management of disaster risk (Government of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2013</ref>).<lb/> Adaptation and disaster risk management are integrated into economic development planning,<lb/> including dedicated objectives in Senegal&apos;s medium-term strategic plan for development and its<lb/> accompanying Priority Action Plan, adopted in 2012. The Plan for an Emerging Senegal (PSE), aims to<lb/> shift the country from a developing economy to an emerging one by 2035, while the Priority Action Plan<lb/> for 2014-2018 provides an implementation framework for 190 urgent measures, which were selected from<lb/> the 451 identified in the PSE. 12 Objectives for catastrophe prevention and climate resilience activities<lb/> include: developing national and regional contingency plans, establishing an early warning system on<lb/> natural hazards, as well as an insurance mechanism and an emergency intervention fund. However, the<lb/> implementation of these activities is delayed due to insufficient funding being available.<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy framework for climate change adaptation<lb/></head>

			<p>The main planning document for adaptation is Senegal&apos;s National Adaptation Programme of Action<lb/> (NAPA), which was published in 2006. It provided the first comprehensive analysis of the country&apos;s<lb/> vulnerabilities to climate change and defined short-term priorities for adaptation, namely coastal zones,<lb/> water infrastructure and agriculture. It prioritises adaptation measures by taking into account their<lb/> contribution to poverty reduction, cost-efficiency and potential contribution to other international<lb/> conventions. However, implementation remains a challenge with only 1 of the 14 priority adaptation projects<lb/> currently being implemented. The NAPA includes a comprehensive process for monitoring and evaluation,<lb/> but there is no public record of this having been implemented.<lb/> A National Adaptation Plan (NAP) is currently under preparation. The NAP process was established<lb/> under the Cancun Adaptation Framework of the UNFCCC. NAPs are a mean of identifying medium-and<lb/> long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those<lb/> needs. One of the key features of this process in Senegal is that it involves the stakeholders contributing to<lb/> implementation, such as development co-operation providers, from the outset. The NAP will consist of a<lb/> series of strategic sectoral plans for long-term adaptation, which is intended to ensure coordinated multi-<lb/>sectoral approaches. Development co-operation providers are supporting the development of Senegal&apos;s<lb/> NAP. For instance, USAID has been assisting with the elaboration of the sectoral NAP for fisheries<lb/> since 2014.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The Directorate of Environment and Classified Establishments has been supported since 2011 by the<lb/> National Committee for Climate Adaptation, a cross-ministerial consultative institution designed to raise<lb/> awareness about climate adaptation. Regional Adaptation Committees were created in 2012 with support<lb/> from UNDP to fulfil this role at the local level, in alignment with the government&apos;s desire to increase local<lb/> ownership of environmental issues. Communities acquired a major role in the implementation of<lb/> environmental policies and natural resource management, aided by the administrative reorganisation of<lb/> local communities according to eco-geographical zones in the 2014 Third Decentralisation Act<lb/> (MEDD<ref type="biblio">, 2016</ref>). In practice, however, local democratically elected bodies, including rural councils and<lb/> water user associations, are dominated in many communities by rural hierarchies based on family lineage,<lb/> religion, and political party membership (USAID, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<head>Policy framework for disaster risk management and integration with climate adaptation<lb/></head>

			<p>The Senegalese government does not yet have a comprehensive strategy for disaster risk management,<lb/> and there is therefore little integration with national climate adaptation policies. A range of actors<lb/> implement activities to prevent natural catastrophes or reduce their negative social and economic impact.<lb/> The occurrence of natural disasters tends to result in the creation of new institutions or coordinating<lb/> groups, rather than reforms to existing ones (Government of <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2013</ref>). There is an increasing focus<lb/> on risk prevention, as opposed to emergency measures, evidenced by the adoption of the Ten-Year Flood<lb/> Management Plan in 2012 (GFDRR, 2014).<lb/> The Civil Protection Department is the main authority responsible for risk prevention and the<lb/> protection of civilians, goods and the environment. The department&apos;s role is to coordinate protection<lb/> activities with the fire brigade and other ministries. This includes collaboration with the Ministry of<lb/> Urbanism and Land-Use Planning, which is in charge of implementing risk reduction projects. On flood<lb/> management, the department shares the responsibility with the Ministry of Reconstruction and Planning of<lb/> Floodable Areas, which was created to administer the USD 1.4 billion Ten-Year Flood Management<lb/> Program (PDGI) over 2012-2022. The Department also coordinates the two early warning systems in place<lb/> for food security and river levels: the National Committee for Food Security is responsible for the former<lb/> and the Directorate of Forward-looking Management of Water Resources for the latter.<lb/></p>

			<p>Renewed plans to streamline disaster risk reduction activities are expected to result in the creation of<lb/> a National Agency for Civil Protection 13 . This would replace the National Platform for Catastrophe Risk<lb/> 13<lb/></p>

			<head>www.interieur.gouv.sn/le-ministere/programmes-et-projets/projet-de-gestion-des-risques-et-catastrophes-et-<lb/>dadaptation-au-changement-climatique-grc-acc/.<lb/></head>

			<p>Reduction, which is established in the interior ministry in 2008. The Platform was intended to be the<lb/> anchoring institution for the application of the Hyogo Convention (Government of <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2008</ref>), but it<lb/> has never been active.. The National Agency is planned to include an Operational Centre for Inter-<lb/>ministerial Crisis Management, with a centralised database covering all of Senegal&apos;s risks, a multi-risk<lb/> monitoring and early warning system. This will use data from the Ecological Monitoring Centre (including<lb/> flooding, bush fires and coastal flooding risks), and a geographical information system (GIS). The planned<lb/> creation of a national school of Civil Protection should further contribute to Senegal&apos;s capacity for disaster<lb/> risk reduction. Progress has, however, been slow and much more is needed to develop capacity and shift to<lb/> a more preventive approach, instead of the traditional focus on emergency relief.<lb/></p>

			<head>Finance for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>Senegal has received support from a variety of development co-operation providers to invest in<lb/> activities to manage climate risks. This has resulted in many stand-alone projects that face challenges in<lb/> ensuring their sustainability and achieving scale. Insufficient donor coordination has also resulted in<lb/> duplication of efforts and gaps in implementation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The section provides estimates of public international and domestic finance targeting the management<lb/> of climate risks. It is based on available data from the OECD DAC CRS, which captures bilateral and<lb/> multilateral development finance, and existing sources of information on national investment as available.<lb/> The aim of this section is to provide an overview of how the financing of these activities is tracked and<lb/> how this has changed between 2010 and 2014.<lb/> At the national level, Senegal uses the triennial Public Investment Programs for budget planning, with<lb/> the current programme covering the 2014-2016 period. The development plan (PSE) also includes budget<lb/> estimates for activities to prevent natural disasters and combat climate change. The country has<lb/> traditionally focused resources on emergency relief and rehabilitation after disasters, rather than<lb/> prevention. This is slowly changing, as shown by the inclusion of objectives on adaptation and disaster risk<lb/> management in the PSE and the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC).<lb/> Senegal&apos;s INDC estimates that USD 14.5 billion will be required for the implementation of adaptation<lb/> policies (<ref type="table">Table 4</ref>) (<ref type="biblio">Government of Senegal, 2015</ref>). The INDC identifies flooding, livestock farming,<lb/> fisheries and biodiversity as priority areas, and presents cost estimates for the implantation of adaptation<lb/> measures in each sector to 2035. Approximately one-eighth of the total cost is expected to be covered by<lb/> national funding (USD 1.8 billion), with the remainder coming from external sources, such as development<lb/> partners.<lb/></p>

			<figure>The National Climate Fund was created in 2015 to scale-up domestic resources and channel external<lb/> ones to climate projects. This fund is based within the environment ministry. The Ministry of Economics,<lb/> Finance and Planning and the CSE participate in the administration of the Fund (DCF, 2015; République<lb/> du Sénégal and UNDP, n.d). The fund is designed to take advantage of possible international partnerships<lb/> and funding agreements created by the Green Climate Fund. It also aims at improving the efficiency of<lb/> international aid in environmental programmes. The National Climate Fund raises around USD 60 million<lb/> per year (DCF, 2015).<lb/></figure>

			<head>International financial resources for adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/></head>

			<p>Development co-operation providers are supporting both adaptation and disaster risk management<lb/> efforts in Senegal. This section uses data on resource flows to provide an overview of trends in these policy<lb/> areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is no specific marker for the broader management of climate risks, beyond the one for<lb/> adaptation-related activities. It is possible to identify expenditure in some relevant sectors, but this does not<lb/> capture all potentially relevant activities. The most relevant of these sectors are: disaster prevention and<lb/> preparedness, flood prevention/control and reconstruction, relief and rehabilitation. These are referred to<lb/> as the &quot; key sectors &quot; . Emergency response activities have not been included in the analysis as they were<lb/> considered to be less relevant to building resilience against climate risks.<lb/> A significant proportion of the ODA to Senegal targets climate change adaptation objectives<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>)</p>

			<figure>. The amounts have been relatively stable between 2010 and 2013, but 2014 marked a record<lb/> year, with adaptation-related ODA reaching USD 100 million 14 , or 12% of the total bilateral ODA (up<lb/> from 5% in 2010). The total resources add up to USD 357 million over the five-year period analysed.<lb/> 14<lb/> All Figures in this report are in 2013 constant USD.<lb/> ENV/WKP(2017)7<lb/> Figure 6. Adaptation-related ODA of DAC members in Senegal (2010-2014)<lb/> Source: OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The development co-operation providers providing the most resources marked as adaptation are the<lb/> United States, France, Germany, Italy, the African Development Fund and the Islamic Development Bank.<lb/> Multilateral agencies reporting to the CRS using the climate-component approach identified almost<lb/> USD 117 million between 2010 and 2014 for adaptation-related activities in Senegal (<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 7.

The largest providers of adaptation-related flows to the key sectors have been the Islamic<lb/> Development Bank (USD 11 million) and the Nordic Development Fund (USD 3.8 million). This confirms<lb/> that some relevant projects are not</table>

			<p>in the key sectors and might be lost in the analysis if not checked on an<lb/> activity level basis. More broadly, there is a need for further research as many of the projects financing<lb/> resilience might be under-reported, due to their cross-cutting nature.<lb/> A useful feature of donor support in Senegal is the active community of development partners<lb/> meeting regularly around common areas of interest, within the framework of the Partnership of Technical<lb/> and Financial partners in Senegal (http://ptfsenegal.org/). This partnership aims to improve coherence<lb/> between projects and to contribute to the complementarity of activities, as shown by several joint projects,<lb/> such as the USAID/WFP/OXFAM engagement. Canada and USAID intend to work together to expand the<lb/> Naatal Mbay insurance scheme in the country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Use of domestic resources for disaster risk management and adaptation measures at the national and<lb/> subnational level<lb/></head>

			<p>Senegal does not have a national tracking system for climate change adaptation and/or disaster risk<lb/> management expenditures. However, there are several planning documents and activity reports that<lb/> provide relevant information on this topic. The PSE estimates the financing gap for disaster risk and<lb/> climate resilience projects to be USD 67 million, of which around half (USD 28 million) is anticipated to<lb/> be met from external contributions. 15<lb/> Senegal&apos;s Hyogo Framework for Action Assessment Report (Government of <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2015b</ref>)<lb/> estimated that USD 164 million per year was allocated to hazard-proofing sectoral investments (e.g.<lb/> transport, agriculture, and infrastructure). The majority of activities targeted at disaster risk reduction and<lb/> prevention are not systematically accounted for in the national budget. Instead, they are financed using a<lb/> series of contingent mechanisms, funds and donor financing. The Hyogo report highlights an exception:<lb/> the Ministry of Reconstruction and Planning of Floodable Areas has successfully executed the emergency<lb/> phase (2013) of the ten-year plan to fight against floods with an estimated budget of USD 135 000. The<lb/> government activated the National Relief Organisation Plan (ORSEC) following the 2009 floods, which<lb/> has also brought in funds from other donors including USD 4 million from the World Bank<lb/> (GFDRR, 2014).<lb/> The government&apos;s budget provisions for disaster risk management includes both direct funding to the<lb/> Directorate of Civil Protection through the interior ministry&apos;s budget and the use of special funds,<lb/> including (Republique du <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2012; World Bank &amp; GFDRR, 2012</ref>):<lb/>  The National Solidarity Fund, under the General Delegation for Social Protection and National<lb/> Solidarity.<lb/>  The Special Fund for Fighting against Flooding, under the Ministry of Water and Sanitation.<lb/>  The Guarantee Fund for Agricultural Projects.<lb/>  The Calamity Fund for Agricultural Projects.<lb/> 15 Exchange rate as of July 2016.<lb/></table>

			<p>However, these funds are not specifically targeted at disaster-related expenditure and tend to be<lb/> insufficient to cover the costs of a catastrophe. Often, the assistance needed after an extreme event are<lb/> larger than expected and there is a need to reallocate budget that has been assigned to other purposes, such<lb/> as prevention. The cost-effectiveness of setting aside ex-ante budget allocations for disaster risk<lb/> management is dependent on the countries needs and the projected impacts of disasters. Analysis by the<lb/> World <ref type="biblio">Bank &amp; GFDRR (2012)</ref> suggests that the procedure to access these funds is not fully transparent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection instruments being used in Senegal<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a growing range of tools to cover the financial impacts of droughts at the national and<lb/> household level in Senegal. These have developed largely as independent initiatives, rather than as part of<lb/> a comprehensive strategy on financial protection. Other climate hazards, particularly flooding, have<lb/> received less attention to date, although existing mechanisms are looking to expand their hazard coverage.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> presents an overview of relevant financial protection tools, which are explored in more depth in the<lb/> following sections.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 5. Spectrum of financial protection measures in Senegal<lb/> Financial protection<lb/> tool<lb/> Level of risk coverage<lb/> National<lb/> Private sector<lb/> Household and informal<lb/> economy<lb/> Insurance<lb/> mechanisms<lb/> African Risk Capacity<lb/> National Company<lb/> of Agricultural<lb/> Insurance (CNAAS)<lb/> products<lb/> Microinsurance initiatives<lb/> (WFP R4 initiative, private<lb/> insurers)<lb/> Catastrophe bonds<lb/> -<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Post-disaster credit/<lb/> Disaster credit<lb/> -<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Savings or reserve<lb/> funds<lb/> Bonus Fund, Guarantee<lb/> Fund, Calamity Fund<lb/> -<lb/>Household Savings<lb/> Ex-ante social<lb/> protection<lb/> -<lb/>-<lb/>National Programme of Family<lb/> Security Grants (PNSBF) ;<lb/> Adaptive Safety Net program<lb/> Humanitarian relief<lb/> and compensation<lb/> payments<lb/> Emergency Funds from<lb/> donors (USAID,<lb/> UNOCHA)<lb/> -<lb/>-<lb/>Remittances<lb/> -<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/></table>

			<p>The coverage of these different instruments is increasing steadily, but they still only meet the needs of<lb/> a relatively small part of the population. Reaching the populations most vulnerable to climate impacts,<lb/> including the 60% of people reliant upon rain fed agriculture for subsistence, will be one of the key<lb/> challenges for the future development of these tools. Better coordination between existing initiatives, and<lb/> more resources could play an important part in increasing coverage. The creation of a national certified<lb/> registry could assist with targeting and coordinating beneficiaries of agricultural insurance and social<lb/> protection, and facilitating faster disbursement of funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sovereign level<lb/></head>

			<p>The African Risk Capacity (ARC) facility is the primary risk transfer instrument used by Senegal. The<lb/> ARC is a Specialised Agency of the African Union providing parametric weather insurance coverage to<lb/> African governments. Senegal joined ARC in 2012 under the supervision of the Directorate for Civil<lb/> Protection. The payment of a USD 3.1-3.6 million yearly premium makes Senegal eligible for a payout of<lb/> up to USD 30 million for emergency relief if the policy is triggered (Republic of <ref type="biblio">Senegal, 2013</ref>). The<lb/> current policy covers the risk of drought, but ARC is planning and designing the Extreme Climate Facility<lb/> to include other natural hazards such as flooding. Development co-operation providers played an important<lb/> part in Senegal&apos;s participation to ARC, with JICA paying for the first year&apos;s premium as the government&apos;s<lb/> annual budget was already fully allocated. The government&apos;s commitment was increased when this first<lb/> premium secured a USD 16.5 million payout following the 2014 drought, two-thirds of which were to be<lb/> used for in-kind food distribution and the rest to subsidise livestock feed. The implementation of relief<lb/> activities is under the responsibility of the CSA.<lb/></p>

			<figure>ARC aims to minimise the time of response to a drought: payouts are meant to be spent by<lb/> governments in the first 120 days following a disaster to capitalise on the advantages of early intervention.<lb/> An ARC cost-benefit analysis estimated that the economic benefits of getting aid to households in the<lb/> critical three months after harvest could result in benefits of nearly USD 1 300 per household assisted in<lb/> terms of protected economic gains (Republic of Senegal, 2013). These benefits include the protection of<lb/> nutritional intake and avoiding the need to sell productive assets.<lb/> ARC also mandates the preparation of an Implementation Plan prior to the disbursement of the<lb/> payout. This preparation allowed Senegal to adjust its resource allocation mechanism to benefit the most<lb/> vulnerable populations. An independent review of the Final Implementation Plan commissioned by ARC<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kimetrica, 2014</ref>) identified a lack of clarity on how many livestock owners would be targeted by the<lb/> livestock feed subsidy and the risk that this subsidy would only be available to relatively wealthy farmers<lb/> owning more than ten cattle. Subsequently, Senegal changed the monitoring of the revolving fund<lb/> receiving revenue from feed sales as well as the requirements relating to the number of cattle (<ref type="biblio">DfID, 2015</ref>).<lb/> However, prior to disbursing the payout, both ARC and an independent review of the final<lb/> contingency plans expressed concerns regarding the lack of clarity regarding the targeting of payouts and<lb/> whether those that were most affected by the droughts would receive support (<ref type="biblio">DfID, 2015</ref>). In the case of<lb/> food distribution, for example, the plan details the number of projected beneficiaries per department of<lb/> intervention (between 4 000 and 70 000), and mentions that beneficiaries will be selected using &quot; targeting<lb/> criteria &quot; , without detailing precisely what those may look like. Distribution of food is projected to involve<lb/> many actors: it is led by the Executive Secretariat of the National Food Security Council, which will<lb/> establish a national food and distribution supervisory committee and several regional and departmental<lb/> technical committees. These will work in collaboration with decentralized administrative authorities<lb/> (governors, prefects and sub-prefects) and Food Security Monitoring and Livelihoods Agents. Village or<lb/> neighbourhood assemblies will help to identify the most vulnerable households. The CSA is responsible<lb/> for acquiring and delivering food at the localities (ARC, 2014).<lb/> The first payout under ARC in Senegal, following the 2014 drought, revealed implementation<lb/> challenges. Underestimation of the logistical difficulties in distributing food to those affected by drought,<lb/> and the complicated process for disbursing the payout within the country have both been cited as the main<lb/> causes of this delay. Senegal is among the first countries participating to ARC to receive a payout, and has<lb/> received the largest compensation by far. 16 These challenges provide an opportunity for other ARC<lb/> member states to learn from the country&apos;s experience. For instance, ARC currently gives the compensation<lb/> payout to the finance ministry in Senegal, following previously agreed arrangements. But officials within<lb/> the Insurance Department and ARC noted the ministry&apos;s budgetary processes were not well suited to<lb/> meeting the demands of rapid disaster relief. For this reason, the finance ministry considering accrediting<lb/> an alternative institution to receive ARC payouts and speed-up its use, as was done by Mauritania with a<lb/> commercial bank.<lb/> According to the Finance Ministry, the current maximum amount for payouts, capped at<lb/> USD 30 million, is insufficient to cover Senegal&apos;s needs. The Ministry estimated the costs of the 2014<lb/> drought at USD 57 million, which was almost double the payout. To further increase the reach of ARC,<lb/> development co-operation providers could support Senegal to subscribe to a second insurance policy and<lb/> better insure its potential losses, as has been done with Kenya. ARC is also encouraging UN agencies and<lb/> NGOs to participate in its new Replica Fund and match country policies to double their coverage in case of<lb/> crisis. Participating in the Replica Fund might be another opportunity for development co-operation<lb/> providers to support the scaling-up of ARC.<lb/></p>

			<head>Private sector<lb/></head>

			<p>Private sector property insurance consists mostly of flood cover for commercial and industrial assets<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">World Bank &amp; GFDRR, 2012; Political Champions Group, 2013</ref>). However, the penetration of this<lb/> product in the market is very low, mainly for two reasons: the lack of general insurance market<lb/> development and weak property rights, particularly in rural areas where customary law continues to prevail<lb/> (USAID, 2010). The exact percentage of registered privately owned land is unknown, but rates of land<lb/> ownership are estimated to be growing albeit from a low base (Durand-<ref type="biblio">Lasserve and Ndiaye 2008;<lb/> Monkam 2009</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Household level<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial protection at the household level has focused on the agricultural sector. One of the<lb/> underlying issues is the lack of land-use planning and insufficiency of property rights. In 1987, the<lb/> government adopted a policy of systematic regularization of informal settlements and planned to provide<lb/> upgradeable, 50-year rights of occupancy to 41 000 households. But this policy lacked the financial and<lb/> human resources support necessary for implementation, and only about 1 600 plots had been regularized<lb/> under the program as of 2007 (ibid). Flood micro-insurance in urban areas, especially Dakar, linked with<lb/> credit, could represent a viable alternative and improve coverage of low-income households (<ref type="biblio">Political<lb/> Champions Group, 2013</ref>), providing compliance and enforcement of the existing land-use planning<lb/> regulations can be successfully addressed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another underlying challenge is that access to finance in Senegal remains very limited. Products such<lb/> as credit, saving opportunities, transaction facilities and insurance do not reach a large part of the<lb/> population (PRISE, 2015). Only 43% of the population has access to credit, and only 0.24% uses mobile<lb/> banking to pay bills (PRISE, 2015). This lack of access to financial markets increases considerably the risk<lb/> of low-income populations falling into poverty traps, in particular after a weather-related disaster.<lb/> Therefore, better access to finance, as a way to cope with greater risk and to escape poverty, could be an<lb/> important instrument for adapting to climate change. This is an area where further research is needed to<lb/> ensure access to finance meets the needs of the most vulnerable populations.<lb/> Most of the ex-ante mechanisms 17 for financial protection of households focus on the agricultural<lb/> sector, given the sector&apos;s vulnerability to drought and the large proportion of the population relying on it<lb/> for subsistence. The first mechanism put in place in the late 1990s, the Calamity Fund, provided disaster<lb/> relief to borrowing farmers primarily by waiving loans from the National <ref type="biblio">Bank</ref> for Agricultural Credit<lb/> (CNCAS). Together with the Guarantee Fund 18 and the Bonus Fund 19 , the Calamity Fund received<lb/> USD 99 million from the government between 1998 and 2005 (Political Champions Group, 2013).<lb/> Between 2005 and 2012</table>

			<p>, the funds were budgeted but never disbursed, until 2013 when an extra<lb/> USD 6 million was allocated to them. However, these funds have been criticised for the lack of<lb/> transparency in the allocation and the delays in implementation (WB/GFDRR/DFID, 2013). The<lb/> government is instead relying increasingly on insurance mechanisms for the agricultural sector.<lb/> The Ministry of Finance has been considering the development of agricultural insurance since 1996,<lb/> culminating in the creation of the National Agricultural Insurance Company (CNAAS) in 2008, a Public<lb/> Private Partnership underwriting crop and livestock insurance, both traditional and index-based. The<lb/> CNAAS is 50% owned by private insurance companies, 37.5% by the government, and the remainder by<lb/> farmers&apos; organisations. Since it does not require a verified auditor to assess the insurance claim but only<lb/> weather stations recordings, index-insurance should have lower transaction costs.<lb/> The CNAAS focusses on index insurance for small farmers, for which the Government provides a<lb/> 50% premium subsidy, and has about 20 000 policyholders. This number includes small neighbouring<lb/> farmers united through Groups of Economic Interest, who pool their assets to reach the critical size for<lb/> subscribing to insurance. While this represents an impressive increase from the 1 285 policies sold in its<lb/> first year of operation (2011), the CNAAS&apos; coverage is still minimal at the national level.<lb/> Development co-operation providers are boosting the CNAAS&apos;s coverage by funding regional pilot<lb/> projects such as Feed the Future Senegal&apos;s Naatal Mbay (USAID) and R4 (World Food<lb/> Programme/Oxfam) which target the most vulnerable farmers and encourage them to insure themselves<lb/> through Groups of Economic Interest. They are also indirectly supporting the expansion of this type of<lb/> micro-insurance programme to new areas through their investment in weather stations. The World Bank<lb/> has also supported the regional insurance industry body, the Conference of Inter-American Insurance<lb/> Markets to provide a legal and regulatory framework for micro-insurance and agricultural index-based<lb/> insurance (CIMA Book 7).<lb/> The uptake of adaptive practices at the household level, and the degree of confidence in insurance<lb/> mechanisms, relies upon the development of reliable climate information services tailored to farmers,<lb/> herders and fishermen&apos;s needs. USAID and the World Meteorological Organisation&apos;s Global Framework<lb/> for Climate Services (GFCS) are partnering in Senegal to fund the dissemination of climate predictive<lb/> information for risk management. GFCS also supported ANACIM to develop a National Action Plan on<lb/> Climate Services outlining their needs in terms of equipment and capacity building to better coordinate<lb/> financial and in-kind support from donors. Reliable climate information services benefit the development<lb/> of programmes for resilient livelihoods. These include USAID&apos;s Feed the Future projects, the Consultative<lb/> Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research programme on Climate Change,<lb/> Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and the R4 rural initiative (Box 4).<lb/> CNAAS suggests its index micro-insurance products could increase their coverage if banking<lb/> institutions required their loan customers to buy insurance, as opposed to only recommending it as they do<lb/> today. The institution also cites the high cost for low-income farmers (despite the subsidy), the negative<lb/> perception of insurance and the logistical costs of creating rural networks for product distribution as<lb/> limiting its development (<ref type="biblio">World Bank &amp; GFDRR, 2012</ref>). The development of individual index insurance<lb/> is also strongly limited by the lack of weather stations infrastructure. Another area for development is to<lb/> increase the coordination with the pan-African Risk Capacity providing index-based agricultural insurance<lb/> at the sovereign level.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4. R4 Rural Initiative in Senegal<lb/></head>

			<p>The R4 Rural Initiative was initiated in 2011 by the UN World Food Programme and Oxfam America, initially with<lb/> Senegal and Ethiopia. Building on the Horn of Africa Risk Transfer for Adaptation (HARITA) Initiative, started in 2009<lb/> by Oxfam America in Ethiopia, R4 aims to improve the resilience of vulnerable households living in rural areas against<lb/> climate volatility and weather-related catastrophes.<lb/> This programme integrates four risk management strategies:<lb/></p>

			<p> Improved resource management through asset creation (risk reduction): Assets built through risk reduction<lb/> activities promote resilience by steadily decreasing vulnerability to disaster risks over time.<lb/>  Insurance (risk transfer): Farmers can access agricultural index-based insurance by paying with their labour<lb/> through Insurance-for-Assets (IfA) schemes. When a drought hits, compensation for weather-related losses<lb/> reduces the need for farmers to sell productive assets and stimulates faster recovery.<lb/></p>

			<p> Livelihoods diversification and microcredit (prudent risk taking): Insurance facilitates access to credit at<lb/> better rates by serving as collateral. Households can invest in riskier but more remunerative enterprises, as<lb/> well as in seeds, fertilizers and new technologies to increase their agricultural productivity.<lb/>  Savings (risk reserves): Participants establish small-scale savings, which are used to build &apos;risk reserves&apos;.<lb/> Savings help build a stronger financial base for investing – but also act as a buffer against short-term needs<lb/> and idiosyncratic shocks, such as illness and death.<lb/> To ensure long-term sustainability, R4 contributes to the creation of rural financial markets, by building local<lb/> capacity and gradually transitioning farmers to pay for insurance in cash. In 2015, more than 3 500 farmers were<lb/> covered by insurance, out of which more than 3 000 received a total payout of USD 81 000, as a result of the major dry<lb/> spells recorded at the beginning of the rainy season.<lb/> Subscriptions to R4&apos;s insurance product represent more than half of the CNASS&apos; index insurance portfolio.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond agricultural micro-insurance, USAID is pioneering a micro-insurance scheme for fishers<lb/> through its programme Collaborative Management for a Sustainable Fisheries Future in Senegal<lb/> (COMFISH). Currently in its test phase, the scheme enrols fishers to volunteer in a collaborative<lb/> surveillance programme through Local Councils for Artisanal Fisheries, as a means to both fight illegal<lb/> fishing and protect lives and assets through mobile-phone-based early warning systems. This pilot also<lb/> offers insurance coverage for each of the fishers&apos; outings at sea which, like the agricultural projects<lb/> previously described, operates in partnership with the CNAAS and ANACIM.<lb/> At the national level, the development by the Directorate of Social Protection of a unified registry of<lb/> poor and vulnerable households (known as the RNU) provides an opportunity to streamline the agricultural<lb/> insurance and social protection systems. The registry compiles information about beneficiaries of all social<lb/> programs under one system, and has been extended to support the next round of cash transfer program of<lb/> the National Family Security Grant. The government plans to use this registry to channel ARC payouts to<lb/> beneficiaries, which could greatly increase their transparency.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.<lb/> Lessons learnt and conclusions: key enablers of action and implications for development co-<lb/>operation providers<lb/></head>

			<p>The two case studies present two contrasting experiences in climate-resilient disaster risk<lb/> management: Colombia, an upper middle income country, has long experience of vulnerability to climate-<lb/>related natural hazards, compounded by long-running internal conflict. Senegal, a low income country,<lb/> suffers the consequences from both urban floods and severe droughts that hinder the security of its urban<lb/> population and have dramatic economic consequences for rural population and the agricultural production,<lb/> a key economic sector.<lb/> Support from donors has made a substantial contribution to Colombia&apos;s and Senegal&apos;s efforts to<lb/> strengthen the management of climate-related disasters. In particular, financial and technical expertise has<lb/> facilitated the development of instruments to share, transfer and finance disaster risk. In both case studies,<lb/> the main instruments focused on the management of risks at the sovereign level, while tools to target the<lb/> most vulnerable households have not yet achieved widespread coverage.<lb/></p>

			<p>The use of financial protection tools to manage exposure to climate risks requires strong co-ordination<lb/> across relevant sectors, and at different levels of governance. Raising awareness both at the government<lb/> level and among the population is a prerequisite for scaling-up interventions. This needs to be<lb/> accompanied with the development of sufficient technical capacity and data for evidence-based decision-<lb/>making. Yet, major gaps remain at present, both in Colombia and Senegal. Addressing these gaps will<lb/> require concerted efforts to strengthen capacity, in particular through improved data availability and<lb/> analysis, strong leadership and clear allocation of responsibilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reliable data are needed for effective management of climate risks<lb/></head>

			<p>Reliable, detailed data are important for adaptation and financial protection, but there are significant<lb/> gaps in coverage in both case study countries. In particular, historical data on past losses from extreme<lb/> events is incomplete. This makes it difficult to target efforts to manage risks, as well as model the potential<lb/> scale of losses from future events. Under-recording of disaster losses is not confined to the two case study<lb/> countries. Globally, disaster losses are estimated to be at least 50% higher than reported figures<lb/> (UNISDR, 2013). In general, high impact, low frequency events are better recorded than low impact, high<lb/> frequency events. Although both countries have specialised agencies working to provide accurate climate<lb/> data, better coverage of climate and weather data remains essential to support risk management.<lb/> Investment in improved data collection and analysis is important for the management of current<lb/> climate variability, but it can also make an important long-term contribution to climate change adaptation.<lb/> Colombia has varied microclimates, but the coverage of weather stations is uneven. The lack of climate<lb/> data for some of these microclimates makes it difficult to understand past trends, generate weather<lb/> forecasts and project the impacts of climate change. The coverage of the Amazonian region is limited, but<lb/> the government is taking steps to improve data collection, including through investment from the<lb/> Colombian Adaptation Fund. This will over time provide valuable input to the development of index-based<lb/> insurance and early warning systems. It takes several decades of historical data to understand local weather<lb/> patterns.<lb/></p>

			<p>The value of translating data into usable information is demonstrated by early warning systems, which<lb/> are an essential, cost-effective component of integrated approaches to the management of the risks from<lb/> climate change. Early warning systems are effective in reducing the mortality rate from extreme events,<lb/> and also have the potential to reduce asset losses (<ref type="biblio">Rogers and Tsirkunov, 2010</ref>). Bilateral donors are<lb/> supporting the uptake of these measures through initiatives such as the Climate Risk Early Warning<lb/> Systems Program (CREWS), which aims to support up to 80 countries in developing early warning<lb/> systems. This is supported by a number of countries, including: Canada, France, Luxembourg and<lb/> Australia.<lb/></p>

			<p>Better data on countries&apos; economic vulnerability to climate-related disasters can help identify what<lb/> measures are required for different sectors, regions and segments of the population. Efforts to strengthen<lb/> data collection are part of a package accompanying Colombia&apos;s USD 250 million contingent credit from<lb/> the World Bank. Historical data are being reconstructed using different sources of information such as<lb/> newspaper archives to better understand the history of damages and costs. This was essential in informing<lb/> the Colombian government on the applicability of tools for managing the consequences of future climate<lb/> events. There are also efforts to strengthen the recording of current disaster losses, which will reduce the<lb/> need to reconstruct missing data in the future.<lb/> Senegal is bringing together data from a number of different sources to create a centralised multi-risk<lb/> database, including data on inland flooding, wild fires and coastal flood risk. Existing information is<lb/> limited to weather data and climate projections, which were produced with the support of development<lb/> providers. The recording of financial losses is restricted to assessments undertaken following large events<lb/> such as the 2009 floods in Dakar. Losses from smaller, but more frequent events are not systematically<lb/> recorded.<lb/></p>

			<p>Improved data on vulnerable populations can also assist with the management of climate risks. In<lb/> Senegal, the creation of a national registry of social protection beneficiaries helps to target and pay social<lb/> protection. The registry has facilitated the development of mobile payments for social protection, with<lb/> approximately 30 000 households now receiving cash transfers from the government via their mobile<lb/> phones.<lb/></p>

			<head>Strengthening capacity and building leadership at national and subnational levels<lb/></head>

			<p>Strong capacity is required to understand and manage the risks posed by climate change. Given the<lb/> cross-cutting nature of climate change, one key aspect is the institutional co-ordination between the<lb/> relevant policy areas, and the allocation of responsibilities across the government agencies at the national<lb/> and subnational level. Traditionally, responsibility for designing and implementing climate change<lb/> adaptation policies lies with the ministry of environment, while the responsibility regarding disaster risk<lb/> management and financial protection is spread across several agencies (finance ministry, agency for civil<lb/> protection, among others). As a result, the financial protection, disaster risk management and climate<lb/> change community often operate in different silos, governed by different agencies, budgets and timelines.<lb/> Stronger co-ordination among stakeholders has the potential to avoid duplication of efforts, improve the<lb/> targeting of scarce resources and fill knowledge gaps.<lb/> In Colombia, the leadership of the finance ministry&apos;s risk management unit has been essential for the<lb/> development of the financial protection strategy. The financial strategy, developed with strong support<lb/> from the World Bank and the Swiss Development Co-operation agency, has resulted in the signing of a<lb/> credit line with a catastrophe drawdown option (Cat DDO), a planned risk pooling facility with Pacific<lb/> Alliance Countries and mandatory insurance for road concessions. The finance ministry is a strong actor<lb/> and can ensure co-ordination within the sectoral ministries as well as with subnational governments<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">OECD, 2015; GFDRR, 2014</ref>).<lb/> At the subnational level, capacity is often limited due to reduced budgets and limited staff numbers. In<lb/> Colombia, the majority of resources flowing to disaster risk management are channelled at the subnational<lb/> level, but the availability of ex-ante funding and budget allocations are limited. As a result, subnational<lb/> governments are often forced to reallocate funds for emergencies form other sources, or to obtain<lb/> humanitarian aid from the national government and external partners in case of a large disaster. The city of<lb/> Bogota has emerged as a leader in the management of disaster risks, recognising the burden that disasters<lb/> pose in its finances and the well-being of the large urban population. Since 2012, it has integrated climate<lb/> change adaptation and disaster risk management into the same institute. Bogota has also created a<lb/> dedicated fund to finance knowledge, prevention and management activities as part of the Strategic Plan<lb/> for Disaster Risk Management and also the Climate Change Plan. The city invested resources with support<lb/> from the World Bank to develop studies that helped to identify high-risk areas and prioritise key actions to<lb/> reduce vulnerability, and consequently developed a portfolio of financial protection options.<lb/> In Senegal, donors including Japan, the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Risk<lb/> Reduction (GFDRR) have been active in supporting national level efforts to manage disaster risks. They<lb/> are jointly supporting the strengthening of the Civil Protection Agency and the improvement of the<lb/> Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction Civil Protection Agency. However, the implementation of these plans<lb/> is still facing challenges, due in part to capacity constraints. The participation of actors from the adaptation<lb/> community in the platform would be beneficial for streamlining knowledge on climate impacts and<lb/> improving integration at the sectoral level.<lb/> Urban areas in Senegal, including Dakar and Kaolack, are vulnerable to recurring floods exacerbated<lb/> by unplanned development. The Municipal Development Agency is taking the lead in improving the<lb/> management of urban floods. The Agency embarked in an ambitious project to improve the management of<lb/> storm water and adapt to climate change (PROGEP project). This project included capacity building,<lb/> investment in protective infrastructure, and the engagement of affected communities in risk reduction<lb/> efforts. Donors provided technical and financial support for the post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) after<lb/> the floods in 2009, which resulted in the adoption of the 10-year flood management plan and provided the<lb/> foundation for PROGEP&apos;s implementation. However, challenges remain including: inadequate enforcement<lb/> of land use planning legislation; social conflicts linked to resettlement; and negative health impacts caused<lb/> by floods. Maintaining robust and reliable data on floods and having the capacity to interpret them have<lb/> been signalled as areas where support would be welcome.<lb/> Development co-operation providers can play a vital role in strengthening the capacity of national and<lb/> subnational governments by:</p>

			<p>(i) supporting the creation or strengthening of data collection and analysis on<lb/> climate risks, vulnerability, economic impacts of disasters and past and projected losses; and (ii) building<lb/> capacity in government ministries and relevant agencies to assess climate-related risks and define a<lb/> suitable financial strategy.<lb/></p>

			<head>Financial protection against climate-related risks: what works, when and for whom?<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial protection tools have different sets of benefits and limitations (<ref type="table">Table 6</ref>) and the appropriate<lb/> set will depend upon countries&apos; circumstances. In Colombia, the focus of development co-operation efforts<lb/> to date has been on improving the management of risks held by the public sector. In contrast, in Senegal<lb/> providers have focussed particularly on extending coverage to farmers and poor households. The approach<lb/> taken in Senegal is partly due to capacity constraints at the national level, leading providers to choose pilot<lb/> initiatives jointly managed by the government, CSOs, producer organisations and the beneficiary<lb/> communities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Financial protection has to be part of a broader disaster risk management package including risk<lb/> assessment and risk reduction. The two case study countries are using financial protection tools as part of a<lb/> comprehensive disaster risk management and adaptation strategy. An emerging lesson is that it is<lb/> particularly important to ensure that the allocation of risks is clearly understood prior to the occurrence of<lb/> an extreme event, thereby helping to allocate responsibilities and budgets to implement a comprehensive<lb/> strategy. The decision on which climate-related risks will be reduced, shared, transferred or retained will<lb/> depend on a careful evaluation of the impacts and the social and economic needs of the country.<lb/> In Colombia, significant flooding in 2010-2011 catalysed political will and policy reforms to<lb/> strengthen the management of climate-related risks and other natural hazards. In particular, it resulted in<lb/> the development of a financial strategy against natural disasters. Colombia&apos;s strategy is focused on<lb/> protecting the sovereign level from the fiscal impact of natural disasters by combining risk reduction with<lb/> financial protection. The government has developed financial protection tools for large, infrequent events<lb/> via contingent finance from the World Bank. They have also improved data and strengthened insurance of<lb/> public assets. Remaining challenges include the management of low intensity, high frequency events. At<lb/> the household level, the majority of the population relies on the assistance of the Government, including<lb/> humanitarian assistance, to recover from an event.<lb/> Senegal&apos;s government has acceded to the ARC regional sovereign risk insurance facility with support<lb/> from bilateral providers. For participating countries, the Facility provides rapid liquidity in case a drought<lb/> hits, as the funds are disbursed within the first 3 months after the declaration of the emergency. As such, it<lb/> is benefitting from risk transfer mechanisms, transferring part of the risk to the private sector, and pooling<lb/> resources with other countries in a similar situation regarding climate-related risks. ARC also supports risk<lb/> reduction through the provision of technical capacity, and over time is intended to strengthen adaptive<lb/> capacity by keeping development on track in the face of climate variability.<lb/> Agricultural insurance is a financial protection tool that exists in both Colombia and Senegal, however<lb/> uptake remains low. Underlying causes are (i) limited availability of tailored financial protection tools;<lb/> (ii) transaction costs; and (iii) limited availability of data, making insurance products relatively expensive.<lb/></p>

			<p>The private sector has important roles in relation to financial protection as a source of finance,<lb/> expertise and potential beneficiary. Nonetheless, the development of the private market financial protection<lb/> products in developing countries is still insufficient to tackle the scale of the challenge. Where private<lb/> markets are less developed, like in Senegal, public support and co-ordination with the private sector can<lb/> encourage the expansion of insurance coverage.<lb/></p>

			<head>Proactive support for risk reduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Both Senegal and Colombia have demonstrated the potential for well-designed financial protection<lb/> instruments to strengthen incentives for risk reduction. In Colombia, one of the central tools being used for<lb/> financial protection, the Cat DDO (contingent credit line) inherently provides an incentive for risk<lb/> reduction, as the loan would have to be repaid. Moreover, the implementation of the Cat DDO is bundled<lb/> with a larger set of measures that will proactively reduce risks from climate change. In particular, efforts to<lb/> strengthen capacity at the municipal level should help to reveal where risks are concentrated and provide<lb/> an incentive for those risks to be reduced. Other elements of the financial protection strategy also support<lb/> risk reduction: for example, improving insurance of public assets and PPP infrastructure also serves to<lb/> encourage risk reduction because risk exposure is reflected in insurance premiums. This improves on the<lb/> prior situation where risks were implicitly borne by the government, which reduced concessionaires&apos;<lb/> incentive to engage in risk reduction.<lb/></p>

			<p>There has been less of a link made between financial protection and risk reduction for farmers and<lb/> households in Colombia. Uptake of insurance remains very low: despite premium subsidies of up to 80%,<lb/> only 3% of agricultural land is currently insured. The underlying challenges include lack of awareness and<lb/> the expectation that government compensation will be provided if a disaster occurs. The government<lb/> provides emergency assistance after a disaster hits, but the incentives for prevention and the tools to assist<lb/> the most vulnerable are not yet there. The Colombian Adaptation Fund has shifted from a focus on<lb/> emergency response and reconstruction to an increasing emphasis on prevention, which provides an<lb/> opportunity for communities to build back better and, more generally, to reduce their vulnerability to future<lb/> events.<lb/> In Senegal, the ARC mechanism inherently provides an incentive for risk reduction, as payments are<lb/> dependent upon the occurrence of a predefined weather threshold being crossed, rather than the actual<lb/> losses incurred. This has been accompanied with measures to support understanding of risk exposure<lb/> through the Africa RiskView programme. The R4 programme provided an integrated set of measures to<lb/> support risk reduction, as well as providing financial protection against extreme events via index-based<lb/> insurance mechanisms at the household level. The challenge now is to scale up coverage at the household<lb/> level, as only a fraction of the population is currently able to benefit.<lb/></p>

			<head>Social protection can help improve households&apos; adaptive capacity<lb/></head>

			<p>Social protection schemes, and other non-market mechanisms, are vital for reaching the most<lb/> vulnerable populations who are not able to afford insurance coverage. Coverage of insurance for climate<lb/> risks remains low among developing countries and, particularly, vulnerable groups within those countries<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Surminski, 2015</ref>). Technological innovation, and the prospect of achieving economies of scale, may help<lb/> to address this issue, but uptake is likely to remain contingent on the availability of subsidies. As a<lb/> consequence, the expansion of coverage is constrained by the availability of public funding (domestic or<lb/> external). The relative cost-effectiveness of using public funds to subsidise insurance should be compared<lb/> with alternative approaches, given the likely cost and potential for market distortions.<lb/> In Senegal, the World Bank is working with the government to develop an adaptive social protection<lb/> programme that aims at enhancing the transparency of social protection systems in the country, and<lb/> addressing the critical conditions of families in the face of continuous drought. The programme evolved<lb/> with support from the UK to adjust the existing social protection system so it can be rapidly scaled-up in<lb/> response to regular crises. Poor households have few other options for managing these risks beyond<lb/> resorting to coping mechanisms such as selling assets, using savings and reducing their expenditures.<lb/> Rapid social protection payments have the potential to reduce the need for erosive coping strategies.<lb/> Development co-operation partners can provide their expertise to expand traditional cash transfer<lb/> programmes to take into account climate change impacts and tailor them to build resilience. In Colombia,<lb/> no specific programme exists to improve the resilience of poor households towards climate impacts.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improve co-ordination among development co-operation providers to scale up action<lb/></head>

			<p>Bilateral and multilateral finance flowing to adaptation is growing, and is likely to increase following<lb/> the Paris Agreement. However, finance targeting the management of climate risks related to disasters in<lb/> Colombia and Senegal is relatively low (around 1% of total ODA received, according to analysis of<lb/> OECD DAC CRS data). Colombia has benefitted from a long standing partnership with the World Bank.<lb/> Senegal has received support from both Japan and the World Bank to improve its disaster risk management<lb/> and adaptation links. A key lesson from this has been the importance of sustained and co-ordinated<lb/> engagement on this topic by donors, given the long term need to build awareness, strengthen institutions<lb/> and build capacity In Senegal, a roundtable of donors targeting different sectors has provided a practical<lb/> approach for co-ordinating efforts and finding common objectives to pursue.<lb/> Collaboration with development co-operation agencies enabled the implementation of innovative<lb/> financial protection mechanisms against disaster risk in both case study countries. The development of<lb/> Colombia&apos;s financial protection strategy benefitted from financial support and technical expertise from the<lb/> World Bank and Swiss Development Co-operation. This was designed to facilitate continued engagement<lb/> in the country, thereby helping to ensure longer term impact. In Senegal, the R4 initiative has provided<lb/> farmers with access to insurance, as well as supporting risk reduction practices. Financial support from<lb/> Japan, and the UK enabled Senegal to join the African Risk Capacity. Low rainfall meant that Senegal was<lb/> eligible for a payout in the first year, which prompted the decision to subscribe again the following year<lb/> using domestic funds.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improve support for financial protection in national development and adaptation planning<lb/></head>

			<p>Financial protection tools and adaptation are not yet an integral part of national development or<lb/> adaptation planning in developing countries, with a few exceptions. In Colombia, the leadership of the<lb/> finance ministry in developing the strategy for public management of natural disasters resulted in the<lb/> inclusion of financial protection tools in the country&apos;s national development plan. This included efforts to<lb/> reduce fiscal risk to natural disasters by addressing drivers of risk (particularly land use management) and<lb/> protecting the most vulnerable population. The involvement of the World Bank and SDC helped to elevate<lb/> the role of financial protection in the country&apos;s political agenda. Financial protection is not yet a major<lb/> component of Colombia&apos;s national adaptation strategy, but there is scope for inclusion in the financial<lb/> sector&apos;s adaptation plan.<lb/></p>

			<p>The situation is similar in Senegal, with financial protection being integrated with the development<lb/> plan but not with the adaptation plan. The country&apos;s NAPA does not directly include financial protection,<lb/> although it does mention the potential for expanding microcredit. This reflects the fact that NAPAs are<lb/> intended to identify priority projects for implementation rather than taking the more strategic role<lb/> envisaged for NAPs. The NAP is currently being developed. However, financial protection is included in<lb/> their economic development strategy and implementation plan. Their Priority Action Plan includes<lb/> measures to improve disaster risk management and strengthen financial protection.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monitoring and evaluation for continuous learning<lb/></head>

			<p>Monitoring and evaluation is essential for managing exposure to climate risks, but it is at an early<lb/> stage in many countries. It is needed for two purposes: firstly, it supports continuous learning, identifying<lb/> effective approaches and helping to identify where changes are needed. Secondly, it helps to ensure that<lb/> resources in support of this agenda are used in a cost-effective manner. OECD (2015b) emphasises that the<lb/> approach used needs to be pragmatic, reflecting data availability and domestic capacity.<lb/> Colombia and Senegal are developing systems for monitoring and evaluation as part of their national<lb/> adaptation processes. Although neither currently has a system in place, elements of the four tools from<lb/> OECD (2015b) are emerging: risk and vulnerability assessments; indicators to monitor progress; in-depth<lb/> evaluations of significant projects and national audits and expenditure tracking.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both countries have produced vulnerability assessments, but neither of these assessments can be used<lb/> to directly measure progress. Senegal&apos;s vulnerability assessment, which was developed to inform its<lb/> NAPA, was a predominantly qualitative analysis, so does not provide a baseline for assessing changes over<lb/> time. However, it could be used to identify vulnerabilities for future monitoring. There are no plans to<lb/> update this national assessment, but more detailed coastal risk assessment will be undertaken through the<lb/> creation of the Observation Mission of the West African Coastline. More recent studies have been<lb/> commissioned by third parties, including USAID (2014) and the World Food Program (2012), but this has<lb/> been on an ad-hoc basis. Colombia is currently finalising an updated, detailed vulnerability assessment.<lb/> This includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analysis. If national vulnerability assessments were<lb/> repeated on a regular basis, and with a consistent methodology, this could support adaptation planning by<lb/> providing indications of how vulnerability is evolving.<lb/> Indicators for monitoring climate and disaster risk and vulnerabilities can help to monitor progress<lb/> over time, but major data gaps remain. As mentioned above, data on the incidence of climate-related losses<lb/> from extreme events remains sparse, particularly in relation to smaller but more frequent events.<lb/> Improvements in data quality would provide a clearer indication of progress in reducing vulnerability, as<lb/> well as supporting the expansion of financial protection. Besides recorded losses, the data collected to<lb/> monitor progress towards the achievement of the SDGs will also be helpful for assessing trends in<lb/> underlying drivers of vulnerability, such as poverty and other forms of social disadvantage. Given the<lb/> spatially-specific nature of adaptation, it will be particularly helpful to have geographically-disaggregated<lb/> data.<lb/> Evaluations of large, or innovative, programmes can support learning about effective adaptation<lb/> approaches. This was illustrated in Colombia by an in-depth evaluation of their system for disaster risk<lb/> management by the World Bank (2012). The lessons gained from this provided the foundation for<lb/> subsequent reforms to address the underlying drivers of vulnerability, such as unplanned development. The<lb/> R4 resilience initiative in Senegal has benefitted directly from the lessons learnt during the development of<lb/> the HARITA programme in Ethiopia. On-going evaluation by WFP and OXFAM (2015) is helping to<lb/> identify progress to date and remaining areas for improvement. Annual progress reports on the African<lb/> Risk Capacity programme have been undertaken by DFID and made available on their website. Proactive<lb/> dissemination of this learning will help to ensure that the lessons from this project can inform other<lb/> programmes.<lb/> The final tool, expenditure tracking and audits, have demonstrated some interesting results in<lb/> Colombia, but are not being undertaken systematically in either case study country. The Colombian<lb/> national audit institution (Controlaria General) undertook an evaluation of their national adaptation<lb/> programme in 2014, which informed the subsequent development of that programme. Colombia has also<lb/> developed analysis of the &quot; costs of inaction &quot; , through estimation of its contingent liabilities and analysis of<lb/> the potential costs arising from climate change. This was influential in motivating action to tackle this<lb/> agenda. However, there are currently limited data on the extent to which resources are being invested to<lb/> manage climate-related risks.<lb/></p>

			<p>The DAC-EPOC Task Team has the unique ability to convene adaptation practitioners from<lb/> development agencies and environment ministries, while also engaging with partner countries and other<lb/> civil society partners, to share experience and promote mutual learning about what constitutes good<lb/> practice. At the international level, following UNFCCC decisions, partner countries are actively preparing<lb/> National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). Partner countries are mobilising resources, building capacity and<lb/> institutional processes to adapt, including at local level. The Task Team supports these efforts by fostering<lb/> exchange and providing policy recommendations to both DAC members and partner countries.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Main policy guidance products of the Task Team include:<lb/>  The OECD Policy Guidance on Integrating Climate Change Adaptation into Development Co-<lb/>operation (2009) provides overarching general principles that the Task Team has supplemented<lb/> with a range of follow-on activities, including: A practice-oriented training based on the OECD<lb/> Policy Guidance.<lb/>  An examination of the use of risk screening tools, summarised in the working paper Harmonising<lb/> Climate Risk Management: Adaptation Screening and Assessment Tools for Development<lb/> Co-operation.<lb/>  The study of monitoring and evaluation in development co-operation practice, which buildings<lb/> on the Task Team&apos;s 2011 survey of practice in member countries Monitoring and Evaluation for<lb/> Adaptation: Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies.<lb/></figure>

			<p>A new OECD Working Paper explores methodological approaches to monitor and evaluate climate<lb/> change adaptation initiatives at the project and programme level. It focuses on three M&amp;E challenges of<lb/> relevance for adaptation and examines what lessons can be learned from other areas of development<lb/> practice: i) assessing attribution, ii) establishing baselines and targets, and iii) dealing with long time<lb/> horizons.<lb/> The most recent output of the Task Team is the publication on National Climate Change Adaptation:<lb/> Emerging Practices in Monitoring and Evaluation. This report examines the approaches used in developing<lb/> and OECD countries to identify emerging lessons. It proposes four tools that countries can use for their<lb/> own assessment frameworks: 1) climate change risk and vulnerability assessments, 2) indicators to monitor<lb/> progress on adaptation priorities, 3) project and programme evaluations to identify effective adaptation<lb/> approaches, and 4) national audits and climate expenditure reviews.</p>
