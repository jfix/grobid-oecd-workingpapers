            <figDesc>Ce document examine les effectifs de professionnels de la santé et les politiques migratoires de la<lb/> Nouvelle-Zélande, en se concentrant plus particulièrement sur le recrutement international de médecins et<lb/> d&apos;infirmières.<lb/> 6.<lb/> En Nouvelle-Zélande comme dans tous les pays de l&apos;OCDE, ces professionnels jouent un rôle<lb/> crucial dans le système de santé. Dans ce pays, pourtant, peut-être plus que dans tout autre pays de<lb/> l&apos;OCDE, on ne saurait étudier les travailleurs de la santé sans prendre en compte la dimension<lb/> internationale de cette population.<lb/> 7.<lb/> La Nouvelle-Zélande compte la proportion de médecins immigrés la plus élevée de tous les pays<lb/> de l&apos;OCDE, celle des infirmières immigrées comptant aussi parmi les plus fortes. Le pays ne s&apos;est pas doté<lb/> d&apos;une politique d&apos;immigration particulière concernant ces professions même si Les filières d&apos;immigration<lb/> permanente ou temporaire font qu&apos;il est relativement facile pour les médecins et les infirmières qui<lb/> parviennent à faire reconnaître leurs diplômes d&apos;aller s&apos;installer en Nouvelle-Zélande. En parallèle, le pays<lb/> présente également des taux élevés d&apos;émigration de travailleurs de la santé (principalement vers les autres<lb/> pays de l&apos;OCDE). En matière de gestion des ressources humaines de la santé, les migrations internationales<lb/> représentent donc à la fois une chance et une difficulté pour la Nouvelle-Zélande.<lb/> 8.<lb/> La concurrence internationale croissante pour attirer des travailleurs hautement qualifiés soulève<lb/> des problèmes importants comme la soutenabilité et la capacité à affronter cette concurrence sur un marché<lb/> mondialisé. Dans ce contexte, il faudrait peut-être réfléchir à de nouvelles stratégies pour améliorer le<lb/> recrutement international de travailleurs de la santé et élaborer d&apos;autres mesures possibles. Quant à ce<lb/> recrutement, l&apos;amélioration de la coordination et le renforcement de la collaboration entre les principales<lb/> parties prenantes pourraient contribuer à le rendre plus effectif et plus approprié.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Annex 2)<lb/> 43.<lb/> Various actors are involved in the funding of medical education in New Zealand. Funding is<lb/> mainly provided by the Education Ministry through the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), by the<lb/> Ministry of Health through the Clinical Training Agency (CTA), and by the DHBs. While medical<lb/> education until graduation is funded by the TEC, the internship (1 or 2 years) and the postgraduate training<lb/> are mainly funded by the CTA. To a lesser extent, DHBs also play a role in postgraduate training. In 2002,<lb/> it was estimated that 121 million NZ$ (1US$ = 2.16 NZ$, 2002) was spent on medical education and<lb/> clinical training (MoH, 2006b). While TEC expenses on undergraduate education represented 43 million<lb/> NZ$, CTA expenditures on clinical training represented 62.9 million NZ$, and DHBs expenditures 15<lb/> million NZ$. There seems to be some lack of coordination between the Ministry of Education and the<lb/> Ministry of Health. Some claim that there is a lack of global vision for medical education, and argue, for<lb/> instance, that there is a mismatch between the number of available vocational positions (funded by the<lb/> Ministry of Health) and the actual number of medical students starting vocational training (the number of<lb/> medical students is determined by the Ministry of Education).<lb/> 44.<lb/> A recent report by the Health Workforce Taskforce (March 2007) emphasises, among other<lb/> things, (i) the need for further cooperation in the field of education and training of medical practitioners<lb/> through the creation of a Medical Training Board and (ii) that &quot; the number of medical graduates produced<lb/> by the training system be increased to ensure that New Zealand moves towards achieving ongoing self-<lb/>sufficiency for its medical workforce &quot; .<lb/> 45.<lb/> One major characteristic of the medical education system that New Zealand shares with other<lb/> OECD countries is the capped system on funded places for domestic students. The intake of first-year<lb/> students is currently fixed at 325 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The government quota has been<lb/> lifted twice in the past 20 years. In 1987, the intake at Otago was lifted from 150 to 170 students, and again<lb/> in 2004, to 190. The University of Auckland had its quota raised from 115 to the current figure of 135 in<lb/> 2004 (TEC, personal communication, 2006). The increase in the quotas in 2004 aimed at allowing more<lb/> students from rural areas in medical schools. In addition to the 325 domestic students, about 30-40<lb/> international students are admitted each year. These students pay the full cost of their studies, which<lb/> represents a source of revenue for the University. These students mainly come from the Middle East and<lb/> most are funded by their government. Most students return to their country after graduation, despite the<lb/> fact that for foreign-born medical students completing their degree in New Zealand, it would be relatively<lb/> easy to stay on a permanent basis in New Zealand. 46.<lb/> Between 1986 and 2006, the number of medical graduates increased from 228 to 322 per year<lb/> (see Chart 10).Most of the jump in the number of graduates occurred post 1990, presumably a lagged effect<lb/> of the first relaxation of the numerus clausus rule in the late 1980s. Presumably, the second relaxation in<lb/> 2004 will see a further jump in the number of graduates from 2010 on. New Zealand tends to have lower<lb/> graduation rates than most OECD countries. While the average graduation rate per 100 000 population in<lb/> New Zealand is estimated at 7.9 between 1995 and 2004, the corresponding figure for the OECD amounted<lb/> to approximately 9.4 (OECD, 2006). For New Zealand, a graduation rate of 9.4 per 100 000 population<lb/> would correspond to 365 graduates per year, as compared to the average of 305 between 1995 and 2004<lb/> (see Chart 11)—equivalent in a steady-state (and assuming no attrition) to a 12% increase in the current<lb/> annual intake to medical schools.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Any decision to increase the number of medical students will not only need to address the capped<lb/> system constraints, but also recruitment difficulties for faculty members. Indeed, recruitment and retention<lb/> problems within academic medicine are common. This persistent problem is largely attributed to higher<lb/> salaries proposed by DHBs. Salary gaps in 2005 between university health professionals involved in<lb/> medical education and health professionals employed by DHBs to deliver health services were estimated at<lb/> between 30 and 60 000 NZ$ (1US$ = 1.42 NZ$, 2005) (</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Registered nurses in New Zealand, the largest nursing category, are educated via a three-year<lb/> Bachelor of Nursing degree. There are 16 educational institutions offering programs leading to<lb/> registration 11 . Due to this relatively large number of nursing educational institutions and the low number of<lb/> students, in particular in rural areas, concern about the average quality of nursing training programmes has<lb/> been expressed in New Zealand. However, closing nursing programmes in rural areas is seen as difficult,<lb/> since it is likely to make rural recruitment more difficult.<lb/> 54.<lb/> By contrast to medical graduates, over the past decade, the number of nursing graduates has<lb/> decreased, from 1 485 in 1996 to 1 206 in 2004. The number of nursing graduates per 100 000 population<lb/> is slightly below the OECD average, 31.8 per 100 000 population in New Zealand against 32.8 for the<lb/> OECD (see charts 12 and 13).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>The second level nurse, the Enrolled Nurse, is the second largest category. Enrolled Nurses were<lb/> educated in employer-based programmes under the Nurses Act 1977. However, these programmes were<lb/> discontinued by health boards in 1993. The Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 (Box 4)<lb/> saw the reinstatement of a second-level nursing programme in educational institutions under a new scope<lb/> of practice and title, Nurse Assistant. Since 2004, the Enrolled Nurse scope of practice has not been open<lb/> for new applicants.Applicants from that date are registered as Nurse Assistants. There are approximately<lb/> 3 800 Enrolled Nurses in New Zealand (New Zealand Health Information Service, 2004). Enrolled Nurses<lb/> work under the direction of a Registered Nurse or Midwife. The responsibilities of Enrolled Nurses include<lb/> assisting patients with the activities of daily living and performing delegated interventions from the nursing<lb/> or midwifery care plan.<lb/> 56.<lb/> Currently, there are about 135 nurse assistants in New Zealand (North, personal communication,<lb/> 2007). Nurse assistants represent a &quot; second-tier person &quot; working under the supervision of a registered<lb/> nurse or midwife in a range of areas. They deliver nursing care to individuals in community, residential<lb/> and hospital settings. To become a nurse assistant, it is compulsory to follow a program length of 1000<lb/> hours, with the students required to complete a minimum of 350 hours theory and 650 hours practice.<lb/> Nurse Assistants are prepared in polytechnic institutes. There are three nurse assistant programmes in New<lb/> Zealand with further programmes under consideration 12 .<lb/> 57.<lb/> Another new category is that of Nurse Practitioner. Legislation establishing Nurse Practitioner<lb/> was enacted in September 2005. Nurse practitioners have an expanded nursing role in clinical settings. In<lb/> addition, they have developed the skills and knowledge to expand their role to include tasks that may have<lb/> been &apos;traditionally&apos; performed by other health professionals, such as prescribing medications and ordering<lb/> diagnostic tests (Nursing Council, 2006). There are only about 40 individuals practising as Nurse<lb/> Practitioners within New Zealand. To become a nurse practitioner, one should be on the nursing register,<lb/> have a minimum of four years of experience in a specific area of practice, have a Masters Degree, and have<lb/> 12<lb/> Northland Polytechnic (aged care) and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (long term and<lb/> rehabilitation care).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme<lb/> The Job Vacancy Monitoring Programme is designed to provide new insights into skill shortages in New Zealand. It<lb/> aims to identify which skilled occupations are in shortage, and to better understand the supply and demand forces<lb/> contributing to these shortages. The programme currently consists of three components:<lb/> Job Vacancy Monitor: a monthly analysis of job advertisements appearing in 25 daily newspapers and two IT internet<lb/> job boards. This component started from November 2002.<lb/> A Survey of Employers who have Recently Advertised (SERA), with two sub-components:<lb/> SERA Extensive: a large sample survey of employers to establish whether the advertised positions were filled, and<lb/> the number and suitability of applicants.<lb/> SERA Intensive: an in-depth survey of a small number of employers who advertised vacancies in occupations in<lb/> shortage to gain an understanding of the forces contributing to the shortage.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Occupational Shortage Lists<lb/> The Department of Labour currently maintains two occupational shortage lists: the Immediate Skill Shortage List<lb/> (ISSL), formerly the Occupational Shortage List (OSL) and the Long-Term Skill Shortage List (LTSSL), formerly the<lb/> Priority Occupation List (POL). The ISSL and the LTSSL are reviewed biannually by the Department of Labour. During<lb/> the review, submissions are sought from industry groups about both the nature and extent of skill shortages in their<lb/> area.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In New Zealand, international recruitment of health workers is important as illustrated on a long<lb/> period by registration data 19 . It accounted for over 80% of annual registrations of doctors over the period<lb/> 2002-2005, and over 50% of all nursing registrations (New Zealand Medical Council, 2006; New Zealand<lb/> Nursing Council, 2006). The annual number of overseas registrations of medical practitioners rose from<lb/> 452 in 1990 to 1 414 in 2005.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>For nurses, the United Kingdom has remained the main source country. At the same time, new<lb/> source countries are emerging. There has been a significant increase in the yearly registration of Filipino-<lb/>trained nurses in recent years (from around 50 in 2000 to 150 in 2005). Also, registration from nurses trained in India and Zimbabwe has become more important. While almost no registrations were recorded in<lb/> New Zealand from nurses trained in India and Zimbabwe in 2000, registrations from each of these<lb/> countries reached 100 in 2005. By contrast, yearly registrations from nurses trained in South Africa have<lb/> significantly diminished (from 200 in 2001 to around 50 in 2005).</figDesc>

            <figDesc>arrival data are also available by place of<lb/> birth. It shows a constant negative net migration for nurses born in New Zealand. The figure averages at<lb/> 300 a year, corresponding to about 25% of the nurses graduating each year. The yearly net outflow for<lb/> New Zealand born health professionals (except nursing) is more limited as it reaches about 100.<lb/> 93.<lb/> Australia attracts a large share of New Zealand health professionals. Geographical proximity,<lb/> cultural similarity, and higher wages, all contribute to this emigration.In addition, except for medical<lb/> professionals, migration is also facilitated by the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement<lb/> (TTMRA) between Australia and New Zealand signed in 1996. The TTMRA established that a person<lb/> registered to practice an occupation in New Zealand is entitled to practise an equivalent occupation in<lb/> Australia (and inversely) without the need to undergo further testing or examination. Movement between<lb/> New Zealand and Australia is also facilitated by the existence of transnational Medical Colleges that set up<lb/> similar requirements for post-graduate medical training in both Australia and New Zealand.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In terms of outflows of New Zealand doctors, the average annual number of arrivals (settlers, and<lb/> permanent and long-terms stays) in Australia is estimated around 330 per year for the period 1998-2006<lb/> (see Chart 18). The corresponding average for nurses is just over 800.
