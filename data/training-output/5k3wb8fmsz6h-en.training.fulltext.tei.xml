			<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974.<lb/> Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member<lb/> countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative<lb/> research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 28 member<lb/> countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among<lb/> its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports.<lb/> The Agency&apos;s aims include the following objectives:<lb/> n Secure member countries&apos; access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular,<lb/> through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions.<lb/> n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection<lb/> in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute<lb/> to climate change.<lb/> n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of<lb/> energy data.<lb/> n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies<lb/> and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy<lb/> efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies.<lb/> n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and<lb/> dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international<lb/> organisations and other stakeholders.<lb/></p>

			<head>Foreword<lb/></head>

			<p>At the October 2011 Governing Board Meeting at Ministerial Level, IEA member countries<lb/> endorsed the IEA Electricity Security Action Plan (ESAP). The proposed electricity security work<lb/> program reflects the challenge of maintaining electricity security while also seeking to rapidly<lb/> reduce carbon dioxide emissions of the power systems. In particular, the large‐scale deployment<lb/> of renewables needed to meet low‐carbon goals is technically feasible. However, it will lead to<lb/> more volatile, real‐time power flows, which will create new challenges for maintaining electricity<lb/> security.<lb/></p>

			<p>Well‐functioning electricity markets will be needed to stimulate the sufficient, timely investment<lb/> needed to achieve low carbon and electricity security goals at least cost. Governments have a<lb/> crucial role to play. Better integrated and more effective policies, regulation and support<lb/> programs will be needed to complement and reinforce incentives for market‐based flexibility to<lb/> help deliver cost‐effective electricity security and decarbonisation.<lb/> The Electricity Security Action Plan consists of five work streams:<lb/> 1. Generation Operation and Investment. This work stream examines the operational and<lb/> investment challenges facing electricity generation in the context of decarbonisation.<lb/> 2. Network Operation and Investment. This work stream examines the operational and<lb/> investment challenges affecting electricity transmission and distribution networks as they<lb/> respond to the new and more dynamic real‐time demands created by liberalisation and large‐<lb/> scale deployment of variable renewable generation.<lb/> 3. Market Integration. This work stream identifies and examines the key issues affecting<lb/> electricity market integration, including policy/legal, regulatory, system operation/security,<lb/> spot/financial market and upstream fuel market dimensions. It draws from the other work<lb/> streams as appropriate, and from regional market development experience in member<lb/> countries.<lb/> 4. Demand Response. This work stream examines key issues and challenges associated with<lb/> increasing demand response, reflecting its considerable potential to improve electricity sector<lb/> efficiency, flexibility and reliability.<lb/> 5. Emergency Preparedness. This work stream develops a framework for integrating electricity<lb/> security assessment into the IEA&apos;s key peer review programs – Emergency Response Reviews<lb/> and In‐depth Reviews – to improve knowledge and information sharing on electricity security<lb/> matters among IEA member countries, with a view to helping strengthen power system<lb/> security and emergency preparedness.<lb/></p>

			<figure>&quot; Securing Power during the Transition &quot; is an issue paper on generation operation and investment<lb/> in liberalised</figure>

			<p>electricity markets with low carbon policies. After a brief overview of the<lb/> fundamentals of liberalised electricity markets, it presents the policy context of the transition to a<lb/> low‐carbon economy and reviews the current and foreseen operating challenges and the<lb/> investment issues. It considers ways to strengthen policy and regulatory arrangements to<lb/> encourage more flexible and responsive operation and more timely and efficient investment. It is<lb/> part of a series on electricity published in conjunction with the overall Electricity Security Action<lb/> Plan.<lb/></p>

			<figure>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 7<lb/> Janet Pape provided essential support in terms of editing and design of this paper.<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Page | 8<lb/> Executive summary<lb/> Will electricity markets deliver electricity security during the<lb/> transition to a low‐carbon economy?<lb/> Electricity security has been a priority of energy policy for decades due to the dependence of<lb/> modern society on reliable electricity supply.</figure>

			<p>Only a few years ago there was confidence that<lb/> liberalised electricity markets in IEA member countries could also deliver sufficient and timely<lb/> generation investments needed to ensure security of supply. Most of the liberalised power<lb/> markets experienced significant investments in new efficient combined cycle gas power plants on<lb/> a merchant basis. Lessons Learned from Liberalized Electricity Markets (<ref type="biblio">IEA, 2005</ref>) concluded that<lb/> &quot; electricity market liberalisation has delivered considerable economic benefits &quot; and that<lb/> &quot; minimising regulatory uncertainty is key to creating a framework for timely and adequate<lb/> investment &quot; .<lb/></p>

			<figure>However, policies to decarbonise electricity systems have served to magnify investment risk<lb/> and uncertainty at a time when the capital</figure>

			<p>stock is ageing and slowing demand growth is<lb/> discouraging investment in many IEA power markets. Some new low‐carbon sources (mainly wind<lb/> and solar photovoltaics) have unique technical characteristics that accentuate real‐time power<lb/> system volatility, creating additional challenges for system operations. The combination of these<lb/> developments is increasingly perceived to pose a challenge to maintaining electricity security in<lb/> many IEA power systems.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Ensuring security of electricity supply is not just about avoiding blackouts at any cost; it is also<lb/> about the functioning of electricity markets. Clearly, a basic requirement of any effective market<lb/> and</figure>

			<p>regulatory framework is to ensure a reliable and secure supply of electricity. An efficient<lb/> regulatory and market framework would also seek to deliver reliable electricity services that meet<lb/> end‐use requirements at least cost. Ultimately this can only be achieved over time if the market<lb/> stimulates adequate investment in new generation capacity at the right time, in the right place,<lb/> and using the most cost‐effective technologies.<lb/></p>

			<figure>In several OECD countries most incremental power production is driven by government policies<lb/> rather than markets – based on feed‐in tariffs or quota systems. New nuclear investment also<lb/> extensively relies on public policy support. This has led to a situation where some pioneers in<lb/> electricity market reform are beginning to express concern about the capacity of energy‐only<lb/> wholesale markets to provide sufficient incentives to deliver the investment needed to facilitate<lb/> decarbonisation while continuing to deliver reliable supply of electricity.<lb/> &quot; Securing Power during the Transition &quot; assesses the threats and identifies options for<lb/> competitive electricity markets embarking on the transition towards a low‐carbon generation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The analysis provides an integrated analysis of issues, covering the impact of the global economic<lb/> and financial situation, energy policy context and the implications for electricity market design. Its<lb/> objective is to identify opportunities to improve regulatory and market designs to create a<lb/> framework for timely and adequate investments, in particular in conventional power plants.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 9<lb/> Key findings<lb/> Energy markets have the potential to ensure electricity of supply provided that a number of<lb/> policy measures are pursued. These measures constitute a basic package that will bring benefits,<lb/> not only in terms of security of supply, but also in terms of overall efficiency during the transition<lb/> to a low carbon economy. They include:<lb/>  providing more certainty concerning climate policies;<lb/></figure>

			<p> enhancing low carbon support instruments in order to ensure more effective integration of<lb/> variable renewable generation into electricity markets, in particular, the participation of<lb/> variable renewables to ensure system security;<lb/>  incrementally improving wholesale energy market design in order to accommodate increasing<lb/> shares of variable renewables at least cost; and<lb/>  enhancing technical standards and procedures, to more clearly define and enforce reliability<lb/> criteria, adequacy forecasts and controllability requirements of renewable generators.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Nonetheless, several reasons may explain why governments have introduced or are considering<lb/> the introduction of capacity mechanisms.</figure>

			<p>First the degree of uncertainty concerning climate<lb/> policies and the pace of deployment of renewables may magnify risk to such an extent that<lb/> markets alone are unlikely to deliver efficient and timely investment responses. Second,<lb/> regulations that restrict efficient electricity price formation, such as unduly low prices caps, can<lb/> undermine market‐based signals for efficiently timed and located investment responses. Third,<lb/> the reduction in spot prices and lower and less predictable periods of operation resulting from<lb/> increasing volumes of variable renewable generation, increases cash flow uncertainty for<lb/> conventional generation, with the potential to encourage the closure of existing conventional<lb/> capacity and discourage timely investment in new capacity. Where these risks are material, there<lb/> may be a case for, capacity arrangements that can create a safety net in order to ensure sufficient<lb/> and timely investments. Possible capacity mechanisms include:<lb/></p>

			<p> Targeted contracting of capacity, which can provide a temporary fix but may introduce<lb/> distortions between technologies.<lb/>  Market‐wide capacity mechanisms can be effective to create a safety net if well‐designed but<lb/> tend to be costly and complex and can introduce other forms of market distortion, such as the<lb/> risk of over‐investment or under‐investment and market manipulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Capacity mechanisms would constitute a shift toward heavy‐handed regulatory intervention, in<lb/> which a central entity – not the market – has to plan how much generation capacity is needed.<lb/> Added to the policy‐driven deployment of renewables, such mechanisms have the potential to<lb/> jeopardise the competition benefits from electricity market liberalisation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competitive</head>

			<figure>electricity markets must be supported by tough<lb/> regulation<lb/> Even if competitive electricity markets are still relatively recent, there is clear empirical evidence<lb/> that well‐designed competitive markets does work and can bring economic benefits. That has not<lb/> been an easy conclusion; given the unique</figure>

			<table>features of electricity in terms of real time balancing needs<lb/> and lack of demand response to prices, market rules must be well designed to ensure reliable supply.<lb/> The experience of several IEA member countries over more than ten years demonstrates how it has<lb/> worked in practice.<lb/> Page | 10<lb/> Parallel to the process of developing competition, many OECD governments have adopted<lb/> policies in order to decarbonise electricity generation in the coming decades. To meet the<lb/> greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming, governments are actively<lb/> pursuing low‐carbon policies. Defining high level principles for the electricity market is simple: set<lb/> a high carbon price, add some technology‐specific support and create a competitive market<lb/> platform to bring in new technologies and innovative solutions. This will create the foundation for<lb/> decarbonising the electricity sector at least cost and delivering adequate generation capacity to<lb/> maintain electricity security of supply. This being said, existing carbon pricing mechanisms such as<lb/> the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) seem sufficient to influence dispatching decisions<lb/> and investment choices between readily available technologies such as coal and gas, but do not<lb/> create sufficient incentive for the large‐scale commercial deployment of new low‐carbon<lb/> technologies.<lb/> Uncertainty about climate and renewables policies impacts future<lb/> investment needs<lb/> Policies have been introduced or are being considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But<lb/> defining appropriate policies during the transition is necessarily an incremental development<lb/> process. The global climate negotiations have proved to be challenging and most stakeholders do<lb/> not expect a new global agreement to enter into force before 2020 at the earliest. Regional<lb/> carbon markets introduced to date have resulted in prices that are to too low and too uncertain<lb/> to trigger low‐carbon investments. Given that any carbon market is driven by policy decisions and<lb/> is subject to uncertain economic and technological developments, carbon price volatility is to be<lb/> expected. Facing this situation, some countries have introduced a carbon price floor(s) (the United<lb/> Kingdom) while others are considering introducing sectoral measures restricted to electricity<lb/> generation (the United States) rather than economy‐wide carbon markets.<lb/> Renewables support schemes have proven effective at facilitating deployment. They pursue<lb/> multiple objectives, including promoting long‐term industrial policies, and economic stimulation.<lb/> They have delivered substantial and sometimes unanticipated levels of deployment of some<lb/> technologies. But most</table>

			<p>of these technologies are promising but not yet fully cost‐competitive and<lb/> renewable deployment has come with a cost. In many cases, they pose an increasing burden on<lb/> the price of electricity for domestic and, in certain countries, industrial consumers. The pace of<lb/> their deployment is dependent on the level of government subsidy and recent policy decisions<lb/> have served to raise the degree of uncertainty associated with the pace of their deployment.<lb/></p>

			<head>The</head>

			<table>growing challenges of designing a stable regulatory<lb/> framework and well‐functioning markets<lb/> Stable and predictable climate and low‐carbon policies would have the potential to mitigate<lb/> some of the problems associated with investment incentives. Examples of such policies include<lb/> providing more certainty for carbon pricing, defining attainable policy goals, developing<lb/> predictable policies for renewables and energy efficiency, and avoiding sudden decisions that can<lb/> erode certainty and confidence among market participants. Governments should aim to provide<lb/> as much certainty and predictability as possible, recognizing that the uncertain economic<lb/> environment and technological developments will demand a degree of flexibility.<lb/> Delivering cost‐effective energy efficiency improvements is a critical component of electricity<lb/> security. If this potential is left untapped, greater investment will be needed in new generation.<lb/> Well‐functioning markets create incentives to deliver innovative and cost‐effective demand<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 11<lb/> response and energy efficiency. Policies should seek to complement and build on these<lb/> incentives. However it is important that there is as much certainty as possible that energy<lb/> efficiency policies will deliver their targets, both to ensure that costs are minimised and so that<lb/> they do not introduce undue uncertainty in demand trends that would make investment in supply<lb/> more challenging.<lb/> Increasing shares of variable renewables exacerbate the issues with investments in peak power<lb/> plants. The variability of electricity demand and the need to meet peak demand has always been<lb/> a concern for system operators. During a few hours of peak demand, efficient electricity<lb/> wholesale hourly prices are volatile and much higher than the yearly average wholesale price:<lb/> efficient peak prices reflect the costs of the plants needed to meet peak demand. With high<lb/> shares of wind and solar power, new investment in capacity, including generation plants, demand<lb/> response, storage capacity will be needed. However, attracting sufficient and timely investment in<lb/> peak capacity and incentivizing demand response has proven to be a problem for several OECD<lb/> electricity markets.<lb/> Removing restrictions on wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions is important to<lb/> ensure well‐functioning electricity markets. Wholesale peak prices during scarcity conditions are<lb/> not intrinsically bad, since in periods of scarcity, high prices act to incentivise demand response.<lb/> More sophisticated structural and behavioural remedies should be pursued to address concerns<lb/> about market power, rather than poorly targeted price controls. Ultimately a more flexible<lb/> demand side would contribute to mitigating market power and price volatility, and ought to be<lb/> pursued to enhance market efficiency and flexibility.<lb/> Increasing shares of variable renewables will decrease load factors of base‐load plants and mid‐<lb/> merit plants, add to the variability of revenues and can lead to very low wholesale prices during<lb/> hours of high renewable generation with zero fuel cost. Variable renewable resources will<lb/> reduce conventional base‐load capacity needs over time. Yearly variability of weather conditions<lb/> may further increase the variability of revenues. Compounded with uncertain carbon prices, this<lb/> will further deter market‐based investment in low‐carbon base‐load technologies. Attracting<lb/> financing with more volatile and variable cash flows will become an increasing challenge,<lb/> exacerbated by the current financial context.<lb/> Variable renewables will need to provide flexibility services in<lb/> order to secure system operations<lb/> At significant penetration levels, generation using variable renewable energy magnifies the<lb/> volatility of real‐time electricity balancing, increasing the challenge to maintain reliable and<lb/> secure power system operations. Challenges include:<lb/>  the low contribution of variable renewables to meet peak demand with a reasonably high<lb/> probability,<lb/>  longer and steeper ramp‐rates of residual demand, and<lb/>  the limited predictability of renewables and higher balancing needs during hours of high<lb/> renewable generation.<lb/> The flexibility of the electricity system can be increased by flexible conventional generation,<lb/> interconnections, storage and demand response. But variable renewables such as wind and solar<lb/> photo‐voltaic (PV) can and should have a role to play, which necessitate that their output be<lb/> controllable.<lb/> Page | 12<lb/> With high shares of variable renewable resources, these will also have to contribute to the<lb/> balancing of the system. The experience in many countries to date indicates that beyond a<lb/> certain level (20 to 30%</table>

			<p>of energy, depending on the features of the electricity systems), the<lb/> variable renewable output must be controlled during periods of exceptionally high output in order<lb/> to ensure secure and reliable system operations. This means that in practice, some wind turbines<lb/> or solar power plants must be curtailed, as is already the case in Spain, Texas and Ireland.<lb/> Investment in other flexibility options helps mitigate curtailment for security reasons.<lb/></p>

			<head>Efficient participation of renewables in the markets requires both renewable support and<lb/> adaptation of the design of markets. Some renewable technologies including hydro, biogas and<lb/></head>

			<p>concentrated solar power with heat storage are already capable of flexible operations and a<lb/> provision of system services. Other large‐scale variable renewable facilities could also participate<lb/> in the energy market by providing a dollar per MWh bid, below which they are no longer willing to<lb/> generate. This implies an adaptation of the design of renewable support instruments.<lb/></p>

			<figure>A market platform for flexible services can be based on existing balancing and reserve markets<lb/> and creates a level playing field for all technologies. Defining flexibility products such as ramping<lb/> up</figure>

			<p>and down, fast response ramping, minimum load balancing, etc. can reveal a price for each<lb/> flexibility service. These services are being supplied by the same assets, and their availability<lb/> depends on short‐term arbitrages between different markets. All technologies should be able to<lb/> participate in these markets, including variable renewable and conventional generation, demand<lb/> response and storage. Participation of renewables in balancing markets would orient investment<lb/> within renewables towards a more flexible portfolio and provide longer‐term signals to invest in<lb/> capacity with the right capabilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Capacity</head>

			<figure>arrangements can create a safety net to cope with<lb/> uncertainties<lb/> While in theory, well designed, energy‐only electricity markets could ensure adequate<lb/> investments, this is becoming increasingly challenging under policies that promote rapid and<lb/> large‐scale decarbonisation.</figure>

			<p>Our analysis also indicates that current policy and regulatory risks<lb/> may act as a deterrent for the investments in generation needed to ensure security of supply.<lb/> Existing or foreseen restrictions on power peak prices, lack of credibility of carbon policy, the<lb/> uncertain pace of development of renewable and nuclear policies, as well as energy efficiency<lb/> policy targets, all induce a degree of policy risk. Private investors are not in the best position to<lb/> handle these kinds of risk.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Improved climate, energy and renewable policies and better energy markets are needed to<lb/> address these challenges. Following</figure>

			<p>the economic crisis, many OECD countries are currently<lb/> experiencing a situation of excess capacity, and thus have a window of opportunity in which to<lb/> address these issues before considering other more interventionist arrangements. This should be<lb/> a priority as they will deliver economic benefits in terms of lower dispatching costs and better<lb/> price signals and have the potential to substantially reduce the transitional costs associated with<lb/> of decarbonisation. This includes improving renewable policies, removing restrictions on peak<lb/> prices, creating more transparent and efficient market platforms for flexibility services,<lb/> developing efficient locational pricing and integration of the day ahead, intra‐day, balancing and<lb/> reserve markets. Obviously, this is easier said than done and in particular improving climate policy<lb/> depends on a range of wider issues including progress with international negotiations and will<lb/> take time. If a situation of excessive uncertainty persists, there may be a material risk that<lb/> competitive electricity markets may not provide timely and sufficient investment to maintain<lb/> security of supply.<lb/></p>

			<table>2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 13<lb/> Capacity mechanisms, including targeted contracts and market wide capacity arrangements, are<lb/> a second‐best solution to ensure security of supply and generation adequacy. The objective of<lb/> such mechanisms should be not to increase the profitability of existing assets hit by the economic<lb/> crisis, but rather to provide certainty that there will be enough capacity available, either with<lb/> existing old plants or new assets if needed.<lb/> Targeted contracts can help countries facing short‐term and transitory adequacy or reliability<lb/> issues during the transition period. Such contracts</table>

			<p>are quick to implement and unwind once<lb/> policy and regulatory uncertainty has been reduced and market design improved. Therefore,<lb/> targeted contracts have the potential to promote security of supply without necessarily<lb/> jeopardizing the the economic benefits from well‐functioning energy‐only markets in the longer<lb/> run. However, expectations of such contracts can distort market prices and might lead to strategic<lb/> behavior as companies withhold investment and wait for their introduction. Moreover,<lb/> experience in certain countries indicates that it could be difficult to stop them.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Market‐wide capacity mechanisms can be effective to ensure generation adequacy but tend to<lb/> be complex, costly and subject to regulatory risk. By creating an explicit market for capacity, they<lb/> can</figure>

			<p>be effective to ensure adequate capacity. They can be used to promote flexibility, investment<lb/> in capacity and in particular, demand response. They also have the potential to address the<lb/> growing discrepancy between the ongoing need for flexible conventional generation capacity and<lb/> its declining utilisation, which is a salient feature of systems with high variable renewable shares.<lb/> They have the potential to encourage competition between different technologies, while reducing<lb/> the risk of over‐investing in particular technologies associated with targeted contracts.<lb/></p>

			<figure>However, capacity markets tend to have high transaction costs and put a burden on regulatory<lb/> institutions. They might have unintended consequences in introducing secondary incentives</figure>

			<p>and,<lb/> depending on their design, may create excess capacity and lower demand response during<lb/> scarcity conditions. In addition, while regional integration of electricity markets is an important<lb/> source of flexibility and efficiency gains, national capacity markets tend to reinforce national<lb/> rather than market‐wide assessments of generation adequacy, thereby introducing distortions<lb/> between different countries or jurisdictions.

			<head>Searching for a target model of low‐carbon investments<lb/></head>

			<p>This work mainly focuses on issues regarding timely and efficient investments in conventional power<lb/> plants during the transition towards a low‐carbon economy. During the transition, governments will<lb/> probably continue to incentivise most non‐hydro renewable and other low‐carbon investments.<lb/> Looking forward, a major challenge facing electricity markets will be to deliver investments in low‐<lb/> carbon technologies, which should represent the bulk of new investment if decarbonisation of the<lb/> power sector is to be achieved in the medium‐term. What will the market wholesale power prices<lb/> be with high variable renewables? What share of low‐carbon electricity can be expected from<lb/> market‐based investments in electricity markets with a high price of carbon? Will this be enough to<lb/> achieve the decarbonisation objectives while maintaining security of electricity supply? Designing a<lb/> wholesale electricity market to reach the least‐cost dispatch and deliver the desired level of low‐<lb/> carbon investment is a challenge that will require further research. If a revised market design is<lb/> needed in the next decade to help cost‐effectively and efficiently manage very high shares of low‐<lb/> carbon generation, work on this model should begin now. The prospect of another change in market<lb/> settings could cause further investment uncertainty and lead to delayed investment, so the sooner<lb/> there is clarity around this long term direction the better.<lb/></p>

			<head>1. The general framework for efficient electricity<lb/> markets 1<lb/></head>

			<p>An effective electricity sector has to deliver low‐cost, secure and sustainable energy. In many<lb/> economies competitive forces are seen as the most efficient means to achieve this outcome. But<lb/> &quot; markets do not design themselves&apos;&apos; and in virtually all markets for goods and services,<lb/> governments use policies to correct for some level of market failure, and in this respect, power<lb/> markets are no exception. Effective policy in the electricity sector should allow consumers to<lb/> capture the bulk of the benefits that flow from competition, whilst also delivering solutions to<lb/> pressing environmental challenges.<lb/> This chapter seeks to introduce the role of competitive markets in electricity generation. First,<lb/> several unique features of electricity are identified that are relevant to the role of competition in<lb/> power markets. Second, two approaches of electricity provision are presented, one based on<lb/> monopoly provision and the other on competition. Some benefits and shortcomings of these two<lb/> approaches are outlined. Lastly, three areas are presented where regulators intervene to address<lb/> problems of market failure, while maintaining the benefits of competitive activity in the power<lb/> sector. These areas are supply reliability, reductions in carbon emissions and technology<lb/> spillovers. The section concludes with a brief discussion of the capacity of electricity markets to<lb/> deliver the long‐term decarbonisation objectives.<lb/></p>

			<head>Electricity: a service with unique characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity has a number of characteristics that affect the way competitive forces are used in<lb/> electricity production and supply. Three are outlined below.<lb/></p>

			<head>Real time supply<lb/></head>

			<p>Since electricity cannot be stored cost‐effectively in bulk quantities, supply and demand must be<lb/> balanced in real time, using complex systems of dispatch among multiple providers. Supply and<lb/> demand imbalances in one location on an electrical supply network have the potential to upset<lb/> the balance across the entire interconnected network. As such, a system operator must ensure<lb/> that demand is balanced across the network at all times so as to maintain frequency for all<lb/> network users. A platform is used to allow all those providing electricity supplies to communicate<lb/> in real time with the system operator. In a competitive electricity market this central platform<lb/> must also be a market platform, to allow for the matching of demand and supply, so that the<lb/> cheapest energy bids can be identified and dispatched to meet demand.<lb/></p>

			<head>Networks with monopoly characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity is distributed through a network of generators, loads and wires. In a given geographical<lb/> area it is economical to build only one network, and a single network is most cheaply provided by<lb/> a single supplier. When one supplier is best placed to provide a service, this is a service with<lb/> &apos;natural monopoly characteristics&apos;, meaning competition between multiple providers cannot<lb/> operate to reduce costs of supply. As a result, networks services are provided commercially by<lb/> single parties and the revenues from these services must be regulated, to ensure the provider<lb/> does not abuse their monopoly position. In economies with competitive markets for electricity<lb/> Page | 15<lb/> supply, network activities are split from competitive activities in the generation and marketing of<lb/> electricity.<lb/></p>

			<head>A lack of demand response<lb/></head>

			<p>Consumers have traditionally had limited opportunities to respond to short term changes in the<lb/> cost of power supply, as their rates do not react to short term changes in overall demand. This<lb/> means that the retail price and end customer pays for electricity does not increase when the<lb/> wholesale price for electricity is highest, even though the cost of that electricity may change<lb/> substantially. The differences in the cost of supply are generally averaged and spread across all<lb/> users, so price signals do not communicate information about the scarcity of electricity at<lb/> particular times. As a result, customers are unable to ration supply in response to the value they<lb/> place on it and will continue to demand electricity even when its underlying cost is at peak levels.<lb/> Technological developments are addressing this lack of demand response, by measuring when<lb/> customers use their electricity and using this information to develop more cost‐reflective tariffs.<lb/> However, in the medium term the lack of demand response in electricity markets continues to<lb/> have important implications for policies designed to influence consumer behaviour.<lb/></p>

			<head>Two approaches for providing electricity<lb/></head>

			<p>Two approaches exist for providing electricity in modern economies. The first is an integrated<lb/> monopoly provider and the second is a competitive market. In practice, a multitude of variations<lb/> exist that integrate elements of both approaches.<lb/></p>

			<p>In virtually all energy markets worldwide, provision via a monopoly was the primary model for<lb/> industrial organisation. Under this scheme, a single agency or company is tasked with managing<lb/> the entire energy supply chain for customers in a defined area. Typically, these utilities were<lb/> government owned and fully vertically integrated, meaning they owned all the assets required to<lb/> generate, distribute and retail electricity.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a competitive market approach, competition is introduced to segments of electricity supply.<lb/> While approaches differ widely, competition is most frequently introduced in generation and<lb/> marketing (also known as retail). Competition in distribution is limited for the reasons outlined<lb/> above.<lb/></p>

			<head>Vertically integrated regulated monopolies<lb/></head>

			<p>Under a model of monopoly provision the vertically integrated utility enjoys an exclusive mandate<lb/> over the demand of customers in a given area, meaning it does not have to compete for<lb/> customers based on price or the quality of its service. As such, government agencies are tasked<lb/> with ensuring that the quality meets community expectations and prices are kept at acceptable<lb/> levels.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where a single entity provides all electricity for customers in a defined area, governments and<lb/> regulators have a role in determining the appropriate level of investment in supply. If investment<lb/> is inadequate to meet demand then customers will experience electricity shortage and rationing<lb/> of electricity. Conversely, if investment is in excess of levels required to meet demand then the<lb/> cost of electricity must eventually rise significantly to fund investments in infrastructure that is<lb/> rarely used. When a regulator approves an investment under a monopoly model, the utility passes<lb/> on the cost of this investment to all its customers. Since no customer will willingly forego<lb/> electricity altogether, the regulators&apos; decision effectively ensures that end customers will fund any<lb/> investment that has been approved.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 16<lb/></figure>

			<p>Publicly‐owned utilities are sometimes also tasked with meeting a broader range of public policy<lb/> goals than merely the efficient and effective provision of electricity. These could include keeping<lb/> the price of retail energy at lower levels that do not reflect cost (for example, through cross<lb/> subsidies), maintaining employment, or preferring a certain generating fuel.<lb/></p>

			<head>Benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>The benefits of monopoly provision are generally considered to be simplicity and certainty. A<lb/> single integrated utility does not require complex systems to dispatch multiple providers at the<lb/> wholesale level, or retail market platforms that allow for switching of customers between<lb/> different retail providers, or an elaborate access regime to ensure multiple parties can access<lb/> monopoly network infrastructure on equal terms.<lb/> A single provider can theoretically integrate all the information it has on customer usage into<lb/> nuanced view of developments in demand. Where fresh investment is required to meet demand,<lb/> a government can direct a utility to invest at a given time and this ensures that capacity will be<lb/> adequate to meet reliability standards.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, regulated monopolies have also been able to deliver investments in capital intensive<lb/> and innovative technologies. For instance, this rendered possible the large‐scale deployment of<lb/> nuclear fleets in France from the 1970s to 1980s, contributing to controlling costs and mitigating<lb/> risks.<lb/></p>

			<head>Drawbacks<lb/></head>

			<p>The drawbacks of the monopoly model are that the utility arguably has weak incentives to reduce<lb/> costs, to improve its service offerings, innovate in new services or invest in new generation<lb/> technologies. Once a regulator has approved a given level of investment, the utility is virtually<lb/> guaranteed to collect the approved revenues, regardless of how it performs. In practice,<lb/> regulators of monopoly providers frequently seek to introduce incentives similar to those<lb/> associated with competitive markets, to promote efficient outcomes that meet acceptable levels<lb/> of service.<lb/></p>

			<p>A further drawback is that like any observer the regulator will face limitations in its understanding<lb/> of the dynamics of supply and demand. Even if the regulator makes forecasts based on the best<lb/> information at hand, these decisions will sometimes lead to conditions of under or over supply. In<lb/> these conditions the risk associated with these forecasting errors are carried entirely by the end<lb/> customer, who has no choice but to fund all approved investments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to limitations in knowledge, the regulator can also generally intervene reasonably<lb/> easily in key decisions of the utility, which makes it easier to pursue other public policy goals.<lb/> Regulators are also susceptible to influence or pressure from groups that stand to benefit or<lb/> suffer loses based on their decisions, even when theoretically regulators are independent. Also,<lb/> when regulating monopolies, regulators frequently know less about features of demand and<lb/> supply than the companies they regulate, which creates further opportunities for their decisions<lb/> to be influenced to benefit one section of society instead of consumers as a whole.<lb/> Lastly, in a market where one entity is directed to deliver a service, incentives for innovation are<lb/> generally considered to be weak, unless governments are particularly and effectively involved in<lb/> supporting complementary research and development activities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Competitive model<lb/></head>

			<p>Introducing competition in generation and marketing means allowing multiple parties to compete<lb/> to provide electricity to customers in a given area. A wholesale market platform, organised or<lb/> over the counter, is established whereby generators can offer their supply at a given price. The<lb/> cheapest power is procured first and this allows for a price to be set reflecting the conditions of<lb/> supply and demand at that time. The electricity market prices allow investors in supply to assess<lb/> the profitability of investing in infrastructure required to supply customers with power. Although<lb/> many may invest, none is guaranteed that it will be called upon to generate.<lb/></p>

			<p>When a party decides to invest in generation infrastructure, it makes projections about future<lb/> demand similar to those of the regulator in the monopoly model. However, the investor is unable<lb/> to pass all the risk of inappropriate projections on to the customer in the same way.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to parties that own infrastructure, there are other parties that enter the market<lb/> merely as marketers of electricity. This involves procuring electricity on wholesale markets,<lb/> bundling underlying electricity with network services, and billing end customers. (Some parties<lb/> both generate and market electricity.) Marketers seek to acquire more customers based on lower<lb/> prices and superior levels of service.<lb/></p>

			<p>Because supply and demand must be constantly matched in real time and customers have for the<lb/> time being very little opportunity to ration their use when wholesale prices are high, prices on<lb/> wholesale markets can increase rapidly when supply is short. In response to this volatility in<lb/> prices, a complex array of financial instruments has developed in competitive markets to allow<lb/> marketers to reduce their exposure to volatile movements in wholesale prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Benefits<lb/></head>

			<p>The benefits of a competitive market are generally considered to be that it addresses the<lb/> shortcomings of the monopoly model in terms of poor efficiency, lack of innovation and too high<lb/> prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where providers must compete to provide generation and marketing services they carry the risk<lb/> that their investments will be ill‐conceived or that they will run their assets inefficiently. In this<lb/> instance, they have strong incentives to make investments that anticipate the future needs of<lb/> consumers, as well as to minimise costs, as this approach offers the best chance of a commercial<lb/> return. In this context, customer choice can help to reveal the least cost alternative, as well as to<lb/> deliver an evolution in products and services.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a result of competition between multiple providers, customers generally see a more<lb/> responsive service as well as a less costly means of supply. It is important to note in these<lb/> circumstances that introducing competition does not automatically mean that prices for<lb/> electricity will fall, for a range of reasons. But we must consider the baseline for energy prices,<lb/> which may be increasing, for example because the cost of inputs (such as fuel) is increasing. In<lb/> this instance, prices for electricity are likely to grow regardless of the supply model adopted, and<lb/> may rise less under a competitive model than they would have under a regulated model.<lb/></p>

			<head>Challenges<lb/></head>

			<p>The challenges associated with designing competitive wholesale electricity markets are generally<lb/> associated with some type of &apos;market failure&apos;, or an instance where competitive markets fail to<lb/> provide efficiently for the supply of a good or service, or are unable to fully value the cost of<lb/></p>

			<head>Securing Power during the Transition<lb/></head>

			<table>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Page | 18<lb/> goods and services. Market failures are frequently defined in terms of public goods 2 or negative<lb/> externalities 3 and natural monopolies.<lb/></table>

			<p>Among the various types of market failure that exist in relation to competitive electricity markets,<lb/> some are long established, while others relate to more recent environmental challenges. In<lb/> addition to market failure arising in relation to electricity networks, which are assets with<lb/> monopoly characteristics, market failures associated with power generation include air pollution<lb/> and carbon emissions flowing from, and technological innovation where the market does not<lb/> adequately promote the development and diffusion of energy technologies such as renewable<lb/> energy.<lb/> Approaches to internalising the cost of pollution long predate concerns about anthropogenic<lb/> climate change. These approaches generally involve various forms of tax that look to introduce<lb/> the cost of environmental damage to the cost of goods and services (<ref type="biblio">Pigou, 1952</ref>). Estimating the<lb/> cost of a negative externality and intervening in market frameworks can be done in a variety of<lb/> ways.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reliability, carbon emissions and technology spillovers<lb/> Reliability<lb/></head>

			<p>In the category of market failures which have long been common to competitive power markets<lb/> the question of reliability 4 is a pertinent example. The system frequency is common for all<lb/> network users over a synchronous area (50 Hertz or 60 Hertz) and actions taken by one user can<lb/> affect the frequency and therefore the quality of power supply for all the others. Because energy<lb/> cannot be stored massively at low cost, the generator used to provide supply in rare moments of<lb/> peak demand will only rarely operate. Customers value reliability differently depending on their<lb/> circumstances. But unlike with markets for traditional goods, there are limited means to charge<lb/> according to each customer&apos;s willingness to pay for reliability (or willingness to ration their use of<lb/> power at times of peak demand). Consequently, all parties benefit somewhat from a system with<lb/> adequate supply, but it is difficult to determine the value that the community as a whole puts on<lb/> uninterrupted electrical supply.<lb/> In principle, a price level should exist above which a limited outage becomes an acceptable<lb/> alternative to the average user. However, this price level is likely to vary as a function of many<lb/> variables, such as the duration and timing of interruption, whether customers are generally<lb/> prepared for interruptions, whether customers are notified in advance notice, and the type of<lb/> customer.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 19<lb/> Box 1 • The cost of ensuring security of supply<lb/> A number of different indicators are used by governments or regulators to define an acceptable<lb/> level of reliability in energy markets (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). These include measures that target a number of<lb/> hours in a year where demand will not be fully met, and a threshold volume of unserved energy<lb/> that should not be breached. These mechanisms all relate in some way to the cost of marginal<lb/> supply, and indirectly to the value that customers place on reliability. In this way, considerations<lb/> about the value of lost load are inherent in features of market design such as market price caps.<lb/></p>

A number of wholesale power markets<lb/> have set price caps at high levels, and these markets have consistently delivered adequate (but not<lb/> excessive) spare capacity, in the absence of other market interventions. Examples include the<lb/> Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and the Texas electricity market (run by the Electric<lb/> Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT); for an outline of the</p>

			<p>For a given construction cost, it is possible to calculate the associated reliability criteria in terms of<lb/> expected lost load duration, a metric that governments often use in order to set the reliability<lb/> criteria. To take a simplified numerical example, the annual cost of a peak power plant is<lb/> 60 000 USD/MW/yr, with a variable cost of 100 USD/MWh. Building one MW of capacity to operate it<lb/> only one hour would cost 60 100 USD/MWh, which is higher than the value of lost load (20 000 in this<lb/> example). Therefore it is less costly not to serve this MWh and rely on load curtailment. For 2 hours,<lb/> the cost would be (60 000+2*100)/2 = 30100 USD/MWh, which is again too costly. With a value of<lb/> lost load equals to 20 000 USD/MWh, the optimal expected curtailment duration would be<lb/> c. 3 hours. 5<lb/></p>

			<p>While regulators can theoretically allow prices for wholesale energy to be bid up without limit, yet<lb/> in practice they rarely do so. This is because customers are poorly placed to respond dynamically<lb/> to changes in prices, so it is unclear whether extreme prices paid in peak periods genuinely reflect<lb/> the value customers place on reliability. A further complication is that when supply is tight and<lb/> ownership in peak generation is limited to small number of parties, these parties can enjoy<lb/> market power whereby they can increase the price beyond competitive levels. As a result, system<lb/> operators attempt to estimate the value of reliable supply to the community as a whole and<lb/> frequently intervene to reduce consumption when prices exceed that level. The implications of<lb/> such interventions are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 2 • Incentives for investment in spare capacity in Australia<lb/></head>

			<p>The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is a wholesale market through which generators sell<lb/> electricity in eastern and southern Australia. The main customers are energy retailers, which bundle<lb/> electricity with regulated network services for sale to residential, commercial and industrial energy<lb/> users.<lb/> Electricity produced by large electricity generators in the NEM jurisdictions is sold through a central<lb/> dispatch process that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) manages. The Australian NEM is<lb/> an energy only design. This means that all capacity in the market is remunerated through market<lb/> clearing prices. No other payments are made in the spot market except those arising from specifically<lb/> designed reliability safety nets and specific purpose ancillary services. (Financial hedges also occur<lb/> outside the market between market participants.)<lb/></p>

			<p>The dispatch price for a 5‐minute interval is the offer price of the highest (marginal) priced energy<lb/> source that must be dispatched to meet demand. A wholesale spot price is then determined for each<lb/> half hour (trading interval) from the average of the 5 minute dispatch prices. The pool price is the price<lb/> that all generators receive for their supply during the half hour, and the price that wholesale customers<lb/> pay for the electricity they use in that period. Spot prices may not exceed a cap of AUD 12 900 per<lb/> MWh.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> below shows a price duration curve for one of the Australian zones. As can be seen, very high<lb/> prices are rare, with prices sitting within the range of AUD 0‐40 for around 90% of the time.<lb/> As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the NEM has consistently delivered capacity additions ahead of demand.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Australian example illustrates adequate capacity in a robust competitive energy‐only market.<lb/> However, views differ on the adequacy of high but capped wholesales prices as a sufficient incentive to<lb/> invest in marginal supply.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reducing carbon emissions in a competitive framework<lb/></head>

			<p>In contrast to traditional questions about market failure in relation to energy markets, the threat<lb/> of anthropogenic climate change has created a new set of externalities. Reducing carbon<lb/> emissions associated with power generation is a central challenge in the project to reduce overall<lb/> emissions from human activity. This is the case not only because stationary energy currently<lb/> accounts for 40% of global energy‐related CO 2 emissions, but also because reducing emissions<lb/> from sources such as the transport sector will involve further electrification – since many of the<lb/> most promising low‐carbon energy technologies are those that produce electricity (wind and solar<lb/> being two examples).<lb/> Different analysis sought to estimate the value for carbon that would deliver the required<lb/> reduction in emissions According to the IEA</p>

They are often used as a reference for what carbon price is needed to<lb/> trigger this abatement &quot; . In the Two Degrees scenario provided by the IEA&apos;s ETP, the carbon price<lb/> should increase from 30‐50 USD/tCO 2 (in real 2010 USD) by 2020 to 80‐100 by 2030 and 130‐160<lb/> by 2050.<lb/> 0<lb/> 10 000<lb/> 20 000<lb/> 30 000<lb/> 40 000<lb/> 50 000<lb/> Megawatts<lb/> Market capacity<lb/> Market peak demand<lb/> Market forecast demand<lb/> Figure 2 • Australian electricity market peak demand and generation capacity, 1998/99‐2010/11<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Page | 22<lb/> Table 2 • Global marginal abatement costs and example marginal abatement options in the 2‐degree<lb/> scenario<lb/> 2020<lb/> 2030<lb/> 2040<lb/> 2050<lb/> Marginal cost<lb/> (USD/tCO 2 )<lb/> 30-50<lb/> 80-100<lb/> 110-130<lb/> 130-160<lb/> Energy<lb/> conversion<lb/> Onshore wind<lb/> Rooftop PV<lb/> Coal with CCS<lb/> Utility scale PV<lb/> Offshore wind<lb/> Solar CSP<lb/> Natural gas w CCS<lb/> Enhanced geothermal<lb/> systems<lb/> Same as for 2030, but<lb/> scaled up deployment<lb/> in broader markets<lb/> Biomass with CCS<lb/> Ocean energy<lb/> Industry<lb/> Application of BAT in all<lb/> sectors<lb/> Top-gas recycling blast<lb/> furnace<lb/> Improve catalytic process<lb/> performance<lb/> CCS in ammonia and HVC<lb/> Bio-based chemicals and<lb/> plastics<lb/> Black liquor gasification<lb/> Novel membrane<lb/> separation<lb/> technologies<lb/> Inert anodes and<lb/> carbothermic<lb/> reduction<lb/> CCS in cement<lb/> Hydrogen smelting<lb/> and molten oxide<lb/> electrolysis in iron<lb/> and steel<lb/> New cement types<lb/> CCS in aluminium<lb/> Transport<lb/> Diesel ICE<lb/> HEV<lb/> PHEV<lb/> HEV<lb/> PHEV<lb/> BEV<lb/> Advanced biofuels<lb/> Same as for 2030, but<lb/> wider deployment and<lb/> to all modes<lb/> FCEV<lb/> New aircraft concepts<lb/> Buildings<lb/> Solar thermal space and<lb/> water heating<lb/> Improved building shells<lb/> Stability of organic LED<lb/> System integration and<lb/> optimisation with<lb/> geothermal heat-pumps<lb/> Solar thermal space<lb/> cooling<lb/> Novel buildings<lb/> materials;<lb/> development of<lb/> &quot;smart buildings&quot;<lb/> Fuel cells co-<lb/>generation<lb/> Source: IEA, Energy Technology Perspectives, 2012.<lb/></table>

			<p>In the case of carbon emissions, a further complication arises, in that no low cost alternative or<lb/> set of alternatives currently exist to replace fossil fuels entirely. As a result, markets (and market<lb/> interventions such as permit systems) must deliver technological solutions as well as allowing for<lb/> the least cost adoption of these. Furthermore, this means that mandating a dramatic reduction of<lb/> emissions in the short term can imply very high (and in some cases not well‐known) costs.<lb/> Estimating the cost of a negative externality and intervening in market frameworks to correct for<lb/> market failure can be done in a variety of ways.<lb/> Trading systems in carbon permits have been established in number of economies in the world,<lb/> notably in the European Union, and recently in Australia. Permit trading systems are designed to<lb/> bring the cost of carbon emissions into the cost of producing goods and services, and thereby to<lb/> improve efficiency in the economy by reducing investment in more carbon intensive activities.<lb/> Trading systems are likely to be most efficient when there is significant variation in costs of<lb/> reducing pollution among different parties and sectors, so that trading of surplus permits can take<lb/> place and the least cost solutions can be adopted.<lb/></p>

			<p>A wide variety of analyses have been carried out to assess the costs of limiting carbon emissions<lb/> through permit systems. The European Emissions Trading System demonstrates some of the<lb/> complexity involved in estimating the correct number of permits that should be made available in<lb/> order to create sufficient scarcity such that permit prices will be high enough.<lb/></p>

			<head>Promoting the inception of low‐carbon technologies<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the Industrial Revolution competitive markets have played a crucial role in delivering<lb/> technological outcomes, comparable to that of the contribution from pure scientific research.<lb/> Where a technological solution to a pressing environmental concern is not yet available, or is<lb/></p>

			<head>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/></head>

			<p>Page | 23<lb/> available only at high cost, governments look to intervene in markets to promote this outcome.<lb/> The objective is not only to incentivise economic actors to address the problem to the extent<lb/> possible, given existing technologies, but also to promote further technological development.<lb/></p>

			<p>Economic theory suggests that significant cost reductions can accrue when commercial parties<lb/> apply technologies that are still in their inception phase. These effects are sometimes referred to<lb/> as &quot; learning by doing &quot; , and &quot; spillover &quot; effects. 7 Considerable evidence suggests that such benefits<lb/> genuinely occur (IEA, 2003). The extent of this externality relates primarily to the appropriate<lb/> level of public subsidy that should be directed towards a technology, since public funds are<lb/> justified to the extent that society as a whole will benefit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of climate change, mechanisms used to promote technological development in the<lb/> market include subsidies and quotas for renewable energy – both mechanisms that direct<lb/> expenditure towards emerging technologies. The objective of these programmes is not simply to<lb/> foster the adoption of the technologies in question, but also to promote development that will<lb/> lower their cost, as others copy the technological advances achieved. An example can be drawn<lb/> from the cost of solar PV systems in Germany, which has fallen considerably. In response,<lb/> subsidies for solar PV in Germany have been consistently reduced (<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Setting subsidies to support technological development presents challenges, particularly in<lb/> estimating the appropriate value for a given technology in a given context. If subsidies are too<lb/> generous, investment will exceed optimal levels. Eventually, the benefits from subsidising the<lb/> production of a particular technology will present declining returns to scale, as the technology<lb/> matures and production is adopted more broadly.<lb/></p>

			<head>Can electricity markets deliver the carbon emission targets by 2050?<lb/></head>

			<p>If the levels of reductions in emissions targeted in a number of IEA member countries are to be<lb/> realised this implies significant growth in low‐carbon energy generation such as CCS, renewable<lb/> energy and nuclear. Electricity markets have been introduced in systems with large consolidated<lb/> sources of energy such as gas, coal and nuclear, with relatively high marginal costs and few<lb/> 7 Spillovers can be considered a market failure driven by a positive externality: the party that carries out the initial<lb/> research does not capture the benefits of technological diffusion, yet society as a whole stands to benefit if spillovers<lb/> occur. See IEA (2008b) and IEA (2011a) for a discussion.<lb/></p>

As a result, the ambitious targets by 2050 for low‐carbon energy in general,<lb/> and renewable energy on a large scale, have considerable implications for competitive energy<lb/> markets.<lb/></table>

			<p>When variable renewable energy make‐up less than five percent of output, it is treated within<lb/> existing market frameworks. When penetration of renewable resources moves to between 20 and<lb/> 40% of output, these electricity market frameworks need to be modified to allow a greater<lb/> coherence in the operation of conventional and renewable energy sources.

			<p>In the long term, market design should not only ensure adequate investment but it should also<lb/> incentivise investments in low‐carbon generation. As renewable energy targets are set higher –<lb/> and even as direct economic support for these sources is reduced – many questions arise<lb/> concerning the functioning of electricity markets: what would be the level of low‐carbon,<lb/> including renewable generation, nuclear and CCS, with an electricity market with a high carbon<lb/> price? Would this be enough to deliver the almost complete decarbonisation of the electricity<lb/> sector by 2050? If not, how to design electricity markets?<lb/></p>

			<p>Further work is required to fully understand how to design wholesale electricity markets and<lb/> carbon dioxide regulations capable to deliver the policy targets in terms of carbon dioxide<lb/> emission reduction.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following chapters examine the suite of methods and approaches available to policy makers<lb/> to intervene in competitive power markets during the next 10 to 20 years of the transition to a<lb/> low‐carbon electricity sector, where the penetration of variable renewables moves to, say, above<lb/> 20 to 40% of output.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Policy context: transition towards a low‐carbon<lb/> electricity generation<lb/></head>

			<p>If governments want to achieve the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 2°C, they will have<lb/> to introduce policies that will have the effect to reduce power demand, increase energy<lb/> efficiency, promote investments in renewable technologies, nuclear and carbon capture and<lb/> storage. Compared to the World Energy Outlook&apos;s (IEA, 2011c) New Policies Scenario, which is a<lb/> central case, reaching the 2‐degree scenario would require reducing energy‐related carbon<lb/> emissions by 15 GtCO 2 per annum in 2035, out of which, two‐thirds would be from electricity, or<lb/> 10 GtCO 2 /year. Out of this total, lower electricity demand would contribute to a reduction of 3 Gt,<lb/> renewable energy, 3 Gt, and nuclear and CCS about 2 Gt each (<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>To make this happen, OECD countries will have to lead the way and their relative contribution to<lb/> the decarbonisation effort will need to be even greater. The 2‐degree objective will require<lb/> decarbonising the power sector almost entirely by 2050. Obviously, the current short‐term<lb/> macroeconomic issues do not help and long‐term climate policies tend to shift away from<lb/> governments&apos; agendas. This uncertain commitment to climate policies is a major deterrent to<lb/> investment.<lb/></p>

			<p>What instruments are used to deliver low‐carbon electricity and what is their influence on the<lb/> functioning of electricity markets?<lb/></p>

			<p>The previous chapter described the high level objectives of what we can call the &quot; target electricity<lb/> market arrangement &quot; , where a proper carbon price is the cornerstone of climate policy.<lb/> Notwithstanding, current climate policies are from many aspects a trial and error process and in<lb/> practice, governments use a broad range of policies to complement a carbon price (IEA, 2011b).<lb/> This section reviews the existing or foreseen regulatory instruments which contribute to<lb/> promoting low‐carbon electricity and discusses their merits and impacts from the perspective of<lb/> electricity markets and investment decisions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Level playing fields for low‐carbon generation investments<lb/></head>

			<p>The price assigned to CO 2 will play an important role in directing investments away from<lb/> traditional fossil‐fuelled plants. In this perspective, the long‐term credibility of governments to<lb/> have a high carbon price will be important. But both the last summit dedicated to global climate<lb/> negotiations and recent carbon market experiences suggest that this is far from being the case.<lb/> Other electricity‐specific policy instruments have been proposed to overcome these difficulties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Global climate policy will remain uncertain<lb/></head>

			<p>International climate negotiations are a key element in the long‐term credibility of regional<lb/> climate policy initiatives: ambitious but isolated regional policy initiatives may not be sustainable.<lb/> Virtuous regions may well be constrained sooner or later to reduce their ambitions, due to<lb/> concerns that carbon leakage could distort their competitiveness and reduce their economic<lb/> growth. Even if current governments are committed to these policies, such anticipation by the<lb/> business community may be sufficient to undermine the investments incentives.<lb/></p>

			<figure>From this perspective, the current outcomes of the United Nation Framework Convention on<lb/> Climate Change, and in particular, the Conference of Parties in Durban in December 2011, do not<lb/> bring much immediate clarification for investors. Since the beginning of climate discussions, global<lb/> energy‐related carbon emissions have increased by 50% and electricity sector emissions have<lb/> increased by 65%. The Durban Conference decided to work toward a new global agreement by<lb/> 2015, which will come into force in 2020. Meanwhile, IEA analysis suggests that if investment<lb/> patterns do not shift toward low‐carbon by 2017, the lock‐in of high emissions plants will mean<lb/> that the 2°C target will be much costlier and more difficult to achieve. In the short term, the<lb/> absence of a global agreement on climate inevitably weakens the ability of governments to<lb/> implement the carbon price high enough and above all, credible enough in the long run to trigger<lb/> low‐carbon investments.<lb/> Figure 5 • Timeline of global climate negotiations and evolution of carbon emissions, 1992‐2020<lb/> 0<lb/> 10 000<lb/> 20 000<lb/> 30 000<lb/> <ref type="biblio">1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025</ref> 2030 2035<lb/> 2005 Kyoto<lb/> takes effect<lb/> 2020<lb/> New<lb/> objective<lb/> takes effect<lb/> 2015<lb/> New<lb/> objective<lb/> to be set**<lb/> 1992<lb/> Rio<lb/> 1997<lb/> Kyoto<lb/> 2035 target, WEO<lb/> 450 ppm scenario<lb/> Energy related<lb/> CO 2 Emissions*<lb/> (Mt)<lb/> *Sectoralapproach<lb/> ** The goal is to have a global agreement for all UNFCCC parties<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 27<lb/> Regional carbon markets are failing to trigger low‐carbon investments<lb/> Several countries or regions have introduced carbon markets in order to control carbon dioxide<lb/> emissions, including the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), New Zealand, Australia,<lb/> California, ten northeastern states of the United States (Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative,<lb/> RGGI), and Alberta, Canada. Other countries are considering or developing such markets: Mexico,<lb/> Brazil, Chile, South Korea and China.<lb/> The EU European Trading Scheme, the largest one, started operating in 2005 and was established<lb/> with the EU Climate Package of 2008 as a permanent mechanism for Europe. While the European<lb/> carbon price played a role in the coal‐to‐gas shift in power plant dispatch decisions, until recently,<lb/> its role in promoting for low‐carbon investment was showing mixed results. Specifically,<lb/> &quot; …uncertainty about future carbon price may complicate decision‐making particularly for<lb/> financing projects &quot; (Neuhoff<ref type="biblio">, 2011</ref>). The current prices are too low to have any influence on<lb/> investment decisions. The economic crisis, the changing economic structure and the development<lb/> of renewable energy all contribute to this situation. Options are under discussion to increase<lb/> carbon prices, such as setting aside emissions allowances and possibly modifying the 2020<lb/> emission target. However, there is a trade‐off between increasing the price through market<lb/> interventions and doing this in a way that maintains the long‐term credibility of the trading<lb/> scheme. Indeed, the long‐term credibility of the carbon price after the current phase ending in<lb/> 2020 will be crucial for long‐lived, low‐carbon equipment such as nuclear power plants, CCS or off<lb/> shore wind‐farms.<lb/></p>

			<p>To supplement the EU emissions trading system, the United Kingdom unilaterally decided in 2011<lb/> to introduce a carbon price floor (HM <ref type="biblio">Treasury, 2010</ref>). The floor price will start in 2013 at GBP 16<lb/> per tonne and will reach GBP 30 per tonne in 2020. But it is argued that even such a floor may not<lb/> provide enough certainty to investors; as it takes the legal form of a tax, it will have to be voted<lb/> each year by the parliament. Interestingly, the UK government itself is at the same time in the<lb/> process of introducing long‐term power purchase contracts (the so‐called contract for difference,<lb/> or CfD), to provide more certainty for investors.<lb/></p>

In a<lb/> recent decision, this system will be linked with the European ETS after 2018. 8<lb/></table>

			<head>Power sector emissions or carbon intensity targets<lb/></head>

			<p>Faced with the political difficulty of introducing economy‐wide carbon prices, policy makers may<lb/> consider mechanisms at the sectoral level, which could still exploit a large portion of the emission<lb/> reduction potential in OECD countries. These approaches are second‐best approaches as they<lb/> may be more complex, and can introduce a bias in the emission reduction costs across sectors of<lb/> the economy. However, unlike a carbon pricing arrangement, they can avoid − at least initially −<lb/> large increases in energy prices and windfall profits, which are a hurdle for emissions pricing<lb/> policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the power sector, a first possibility would be to limit the scope of emissions trading to this<lb/> sector, setting power sector emission targets in MtCO 2 , encompassing generation and power<lb/> demand in order to preserve the incentives to reduce electricity demand and seek gains in energy<lb/> efficiency. An argument for adopting such a measure is to reduce to some extent the carbon price<lb/> uncertainty associated with industrial demand.<lb/></p>

			<p>But a second possibility proposed recently in the United States consists of restricting the scope of<lb/> the carbon constraint to the generation side even further, by setting a standard for the emissions<lb/> intensity of the generation mix. The arguments for adopting such measure are that this creates a<lb/> level playing field for all low‐carbon generation technologies (renewables, nuclear, CCS), leaving<lb/> to the market the responsibility to select the most promising technologies and handle changes in<lb/> future costs of different generation technologies and fuels. Thereby, it creates more certainty<lb/> while avoiding picking technology &quot; winners &quot; . Furthermore, such a standard for emissions can<lb/> avoid a large increase in electricity prices in the early stage of its introduction, which would<lb/> otherwise be necessary to trigger low carbon investments. The associated argument against this<lb/> approach is that, it may be less effective at reducing electricity demand than a carbon price.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although it is not clear whether this proposal would create a more stable investment framework<lb/> and will be applied in the United States (see Box 3), electricity sector mechanisms may be an<lb/> interesting instrument. They can address the price uncertainty associated with industrial demand<lb/> of quotas in an economy‐wide cap and trade mechanism. They can also address the bias<lb/> introduced by technology‐specific policies, an issue that is discussed in the next section.<lb/>Page | 29<lb/></p>

			<head>Policies to supplement a carbon price are technology specific<lb/></head>

			<p>In parallel with climate policies such as carbon prices, policy makers introduced low‐carbon<lb/> generation support measures, combining efforts in research, development and demonstration, as<lb/> well as technology learning resulting from marketplace deployment. Some low‐carbon energy<lb/> technologies are already competitive or close to becoming commercial and should be the first to<lb/> be deployed on a massive scale. This is the case of nuclear energy, on shore wind and solar PV in<lb/> certain regions. Many off‐shore wind farms have already been built and some governments are<lb/> actively pursuing the large‐scale deployment of this technology. Other low‐carbon technologies<lb/> such as CCS, which has a huge potential, are less mature and require a longer‐term vision.<lb/></p>

			<p>The initial argument for adopting marketplace deployment measures is that low‐carbon<lb/> technologies will be needed to deliver timely CO 2 emissions cuts. Even where carbon pricing has<lb/> been introduced, these technology policies have been kept or even accelerated. Indeed, in<lb/> addition to their environmental benefits, deployment policies may be justified to reduce<lb/> dependence on imported fuels, create local &quot; green jobs &quot; to stimulate economic growth and<lb/> pursue industrial policy objectives to favour the emergence of global industrial leaders able to<lb/> export the technology and create competitive jobs in the long run.<lb/></p>

			<p>Many low‐carbon generation technologies are generally not yet cost‐competitive with gas and<lb/> coal power plants, given the current level of fossil fuel and emissions prices. Furthermore, there is<lb/> a wide range of costs of different technologies, so policies to create a level playing field between<lb/> all low‐carbon technologies would lead to investments in the least costly ones, depending on<lb/> resources, probably large hydro, onshore wind and nuclear. With the goal of advancing a range of<lb/> technologies, governments have therefore introduced technology specific measures to deliver<lb/> investments in a portfolio of technologies and not only the most mature technologies at a given<lb/> point in time.<lb/> Following the failure in 2010 to pass a comprehensive cap and trade bill to reduce carbon, the<lb/> Obama Administration proposed a Clean Energy Standard. Under this approach, electricity<lb/> generators would be required to meet a rising fraction of their generation using zero carbon sources<lb/> or sources with lower carbon intensity (RFF, 2012).<lb/></p>

			<table>&quot; A Clean Energy Standard is a policy that requires covered electricity retailers to supply a specified<lb/> share of their electricity sales from qualifying energy resources. The impact of a CES can vary<lb/> substantially based on the specifications of policy details. The specifications of the bill, Clean Energy<lb/> Standard Act of 2012 are the following (EIA, 2012):<lb/>  All generation from existing and new wind, geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and<lb/> landfill gas plants earns full credits; Hydroelectric and nuclear generation from capacity and<lb/> uprates placed in service after 1991 earn full credits;<lb/>  Generation from nuclear and hydroelectric capacity placed in service prior to 1992 does not<lb/> receive any credit, but the total generation from these two sources is deducted from the overall<lb/> requirement for credits and deducted from the sales baseline of those owning them and<lb/> purchasing power; and<lb/>  Partial credits are earned for generation using specific technologies fueled by natural gas or coal<lb/> based on a calculated crediting factor that reflects the carbon intensity of each technology. (…)<lb/> The Bill Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 target for the share of retail electricity sales from clean<lb/> energy sources starts at 24% in 2015 and ultimately reached 84% in 2035. (…) It is assumed that the<lb/> target remains constant after 2035 and that the policy does not expire. &quot;<lb/></table>

			<p>The design of specific instruments to support these technologies must tackle the fact that the<lb/> initial upfront investment cost typically represents 80% or more of the cost of production. This<lb/> implies that the main question for policy makers is to provide appropriate risk/returns to<lb/> investors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Renewable support policies have been effective<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the last five years, the installed capacity of wind and solar PV increased dramatically, by<lb/> more than 10% for solar PV and by more than 20% per annum for on-shore wind. In Europe, these<lb/> developments have been driven by the 2020 renewable targets. In the United States, tax<lb/> incentives and renewable portfolio standards played a role.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8 • Installed capacity of solar PV and onshore wind worldwide, GW (1992-2020)<lb/> Renewable energy deployment has been extensively analysed (IEA, 2011a and 2012b), including<lb/> the renewable support mechanisms best suited to attract the capital needed to finance<lb/> renewables. With regard to the comparison of different support mechanisms, it appears that<lb/> feed-in tariffs, where governments pay a guaranteed price and renewables benefit from priority<lb/> dispatch, have been the most effective tool (IEA, 2011a). In some cases, a tendering process can<lb/> be used to define feed-in tariffs for specific projects. While remaining higher than on-shore wind<lb/> and conventional power generation technologies, solar PV costs have decreased dramatically in<lb/> the last few years. In combination with effective renewable support policies, this has recently<lb/> bolstered renewables in a way that had not been anticipated. However, for a number of reasons,<lb/> including the financing of renewable support policies, RE deployment shows signs of slowing<lb/> down, in particular in countries facing hard economic times. This might increase both the<lb/> Solar<lb/> PV<lb/> Onshore<lb/> Wind<lb/> Nuclear<lb/> Coal<lb/> CCS<lb/> Coal<lb/> CCGT<lb/> CO2<lb/> Fuel<lb/> O&amp;M<lb/> Capital<lb/> 0<lb/> 10<lb/> 20<lb/> 30<lb/> 40<lb/> 50<lb/> 60<lb/> 70<lb/> 80<lb/> 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011<lb/> GW<lb/> RoW<lb/> China<lb/> US<lb/> Spain<lb/> Japan<lb/> Italy<lb/> Germany<lb/> Solar PV<lb/> %<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 31<lb/> uncertainty concerning the deployment in the long run and the risk of forecast errors in residual<lb/> demand addressed to conventional generation.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The experience in many countries like Spain, Germany and Italy makes it fairly clear that<lb/> successful deployment of renewable energy have come with a cost. For instance, in Germany, the<lb/> renewable support costs already reach 3.5 cents EUR/kWh compared to a wholesale market price<lb/> of c. 5 cents EUR/kWh and a retail price of c. 24 cents EUR/kWh for domestic consumers. In Spain<lb/> the renewable support costs amount to EUR 7 billion per year above the market price, c. 0.7% of<lb/> the gross domestic product, while the country is struggling to reduce its budget deficit.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some OECD countries, deployment of renewables now shows signs of slowing down. In certain<lb/> countries, in 2009‐2011, some governments failed to adjust feed‐in tariffs according to cost<lb/> decreases, which triggered rapid and very high solar PV installation. This solar bubble has been<lb/> very profitable for project developers but very costly for electricity consumers. Adjustments had<lb/> to be made and governments cut too generous feed‐in tariffs for solar PV. These adjustments also<lb/> reflect that renewables targets in percentage of generation will be more easily achieved as<lb/> demand stalls, due to the economic crisis in certain countries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another reason explaining a growing uncertainty over renewable deployment is that solar<lb/> equipment manufacturers have experienced significant competition from emerging countries,<lb/> most notably China. The solar industry in Europe and the United States was severely hit in 2010<lb/> and 2011 by China&apos;s leading position on the solar PV industry, somewhat weakening the economic<lb/> case for expensive feed‐in tariffs in OECD countries.<lb/> This is very important for the deployment of renewables until 2020, as they will, in general,<lb/> continue to be subsidized or mandated. Hopefully, some renewable technologies might reach<lb/> competitiveness with conventional technologies soon, which will allow them to escape from the<lb/> threat of political backlash. This future of renewables may now dramatically depend on the<lb/> capacity of technologies to deliver the promised learning rates.<lb/></p>

			<head>Nuclear<lb/></head>

			<p>Nuclear power produces bulk low‐carbon electricity, and unlike most of renewable energy<lb/> technologies, it is dispatchable and it is already competitive, provided that the cost of capital used<lb/> to finance the technology is not too high. However, nuclear energy experienced significant cost<lb/> overruns and delays in IEA countries, and the capacity of the nuclear industry to build on time and<lb/> on cost is a key element to keeping the cost of financing low and ensuring competitiveness.<lb/> Besides costs, nuclear energy is also exposed to market price risks under the current liberalised<lb/> market arrangement where electricity prices are set according to gas or coal prices. Based upon<lb/> the experience in recent nuclear project developments, it is possible to say that no new merchant<lb/> nuclear plants have been decided in liberalised markets recently. Nuclear power plants currently<lb/> under construction do not face long‐run market price risks and benefit either from long‐term<lb/> power purchase agreements or their inclusion in the regulatory asset base.<lb/></p>

			<p>The accident of Fukushima did not obliterate the nuclear industry, although some countries<lb/> decided to phase out nuclear power, most notably Germany and Switzerland. Japan will also have<lb/> to decide of the role of nuclear energy in the coming years, given that the seismic/tsunami risk<lb/> faced by the archipelago had not been sufficiently addressed at Fukushima. On the contrary,<lb/> other large nuclear countries (China, Russia, Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom)<lb/> have reaffirmed their support to nuclear energy and are actively continuing to create the proper<lb/> regulatory frameworks to build new nuclear plants. With regard to nuclear waste, several OECD<lb/> countries still need to find long‐term storage solutions, and this legacy will continue to require<lb/> much effort in the coming years, whether nuclear countries build new reactors or not.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 32<lb/></figure>

			<p>From the perspective of security of supply, nuclear contributes to diversifying the electricity<lb/> generation mix, and while uranium is generally imported, the production is widely distributed<lb/> around the world and notably in OECD countries (Australia and Canada). In addition, large<lb/> quantities of uranium can be easily stored and the stockpiles accumulated for military purposes<lb/> represent several years of consumption, de facto eliminating any risk of fuel supply disruption.<lb/> The main risks for security of supply could be a backlash from the population or a political risk of<lb/> forced closure, which could lead to shutting down reactors rapidly. Another risk might come from<lb/> finding of some type of fault on a series of reactors such as the cracks on reactor pressure vessels<lb/> recently found in Belgium.<lb/></p>

			<p>For countries where new nuclear capacity will be high, it may also be necessary to define<lb/> strategies to mitigate the risk that delays of nuclear could cause for generation adequacy. In<lb/> practice, this would require maintaining mothballed power plants or delaying the retirement of<lb/> older units.<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy efficiency policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Energy efficiency is one of the pillars of climate policies. According to the 2011 World Energy<lb/> Outlook, reducing electricity end‐use demand alone accounts for one‐third of reduced<lb/> greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 to 15 years in the 450 ppm scenario. The potential for<lb/> end‐use efficiency improvements is enormous. National studies of economic energy efficiency<lb/> improvements routinely estimate an economic energy savings potential of 20 to 25 percent over<lb/> the next decade (<ref type="biblio">McKinsey, 2009</ref>). Based on such projections, some governments have set<lb/> ambitious targets of 10 to 15 percent for networked energy sales (gas and electricity) over the<lb/> next decade (The State and Local Energy Efficiency Action Network, 2011).<lb/></p>

			<p>Seen from an electricity security viewpoint, such projections beg the question of whether<lb/> networked energy providers should plan based on historical demand growth trends or demand<lb/> reductions to be achieved in response to energy savings targets. The answer is mixed. In the EU,<lb/></p>

			<table>progress towards the 20/20 energy savings target set in 2006 has fallen well short through 2012.<lb/> Recognizing this, the European Parliament and Council of Ministers recently enacted a new<lb/> Energy Efficiency Directive containing binding measures, not least of which are annual energy<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 33<lb/> savings targets for energy providers. 9 If EU Member States enact these targets and energy<lb/> providers meet them, the result would be a 9% reduction on final energy sales over the period<lb/> 2014 to 2020. In other jurisdictions with extensive energy efficiency programmes – Australia, the<lb/> Pacific Northwest and New England – electricity sales are on a downward trend. In Australia,<lb/> according to the AEMO&apos;s 2012 Electricity Statement of Opportunities, 10<lb/> &quot; the reduction in growth in electricity demand in Australia may be attributable to changes in<lb/> the economic outlook, including a short‐term moderation in gross domestic surplus (GDP),<lb/> reduced manufacturing consumption and consumer response to rising electricity prices and<lb/> energy efficiency measures &quot; .<lb/> Uncertainty in demand forecasts, however, is nothing new.

			<head>Carbon capture and storage progress<lb/></head>

			<p>Carbon</p>

			<table>capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 )<lb/> emissions from electricity generation. In the IEA publication Energy Technology Perspectives 2012<lb/> (IEA, 2012a), CCS contributes slightly more than one‐fifth of energy‐related emissions reductions<lb/> between 2015 and 2050 in the 2°C Scenario (2DS). Approximately half of emissions reductions<lb/> resulting from the application of CCS under the 2DS are from power generation, with 63% of coal‐<lb/> fired generation, 18% of gas and 9% of biomass generation equipped with CCS by 2050. 11<lb/> Despite the majority of support for CCS demonstration being focused on power generation<lb/> applications (Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, 2011), none of the four currently‐<lb/> operating large‐scale integrated projects (LSIPs) that carry out sufficient monitoring to<lb/> demonstrate permanent storage of CCS are related to power generation. Of the seven LSIPs under<lb/> construction, only two involve capture of CO 2 from power generation. 12<lb/></table>

			<p>All of necessary technologies exist today for CCS to be applied to power generation, but require<lb/> demonstration at large scale before they can be considered commercially viable. Capture<lb/> technologies for power generation (i.e. pre‐combustion, post‐combustion and oxy‐combustion)<lb/> are at different stages of readiness, but are generally in pilot‐testing stages for coal and gas‐fired<lb/> generation (IEA, 2012a, p. 339). However, CCS deployment rates are currently woefully off pace to<lb/> reach the approximately 16 GW of CCS equipped power generation in 2020 in the 2DS, and both<lb/> government and industry need to redouble efforts to demonstrate CCS at commercial scale<lb/> (i.e. hundreds of megawatts and up) for CCS to get back on track to meeting its emissions<lb/> reduction potential.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cost of electricity from power plants fitted with CCS is expected to become generally<lb/> competitive with that of other low‐carbon technologies such as wind or solar power. However,<lb/></p>

			<table>widespread CCS deployment will not occur without strong and credible emissions reduction<lb/> policies from governments, additional funding for CCS demonstration and deployment, and clear<lb/> deployment strategies and policies for CCS technologies. Significant work remains to be done<lb/> across these areas.<lb/> Page | 34<lb/> How does the transition affect security of electricity supply?<lb/> Thanks to recent renewable policies, compounded with declining costs of wind on shore and solar<lb/> PV, renewables represented about half of the capacity installed in the United States and the<lb/> European Union in 2011 (Figures 9 and 10). IEA 450 ppm scenario indicates that further<lb/> decarbonisation of the power sector is necessary to achieve the global goal of stabilising<lb/> temperature to 2 degrees Celsius. In this scenario, investment in low‐carbon generating capacity<lb/> comprises 55% of total new capacity from now until 2020, and 91% from 2020 to 2035. Recent EU<lb/> 2050 scenarios indicate similar trends, place great emphasis on the role of renewables, with<lb/> scenarios with very high shares of renewables.<lb/></table>

			<p>These developments take place in a context in which electricity demand is sluggish in most OECD<lb/> countries, mainly due to the economic crisis following a period to high growth. The bad news is<lb/> that most of the countries have excess capacity and therefore market prices are relatively low<lb/> which leads to a low profitability of existing assets. The good news is that these countries do not<lb/> face serious security of supply issues before at least the end of the decade.

			<p>Conventional power plants will also be needed to make up for variations in renewable generation<lb/> and ensure electricity security of supply, which is the key issue addressed in this paper. This raises<lb/> another related set of questions: are the current market arrangements capable to deliver enough<lb/> capacity during peak periods in order to ensure generation adequacy? Does this change the<lb/> capability of the market arrangements to deliver the investments needed? How the market<lb/> arrangements should be changed in order to ensure market based investments in capacity<lb/> necessary to maintain electricity security of supply?<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> summarizes the impact of the different energy policies on the functioning of the price<lb/> setting mechanism on electricity markets:<lb/> 1.

			<p>2. Most renewable capacity has a null marginal cost and policy‐induced investments displace the<lb/> merit order to the right hand side, reducing prices as well as the load factor of existing<lb/> dispatchable plants.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Nuclear capacity remains a matter of public policy.

Operating challenges<lb/> At significant penetration levels, generation using variable renewable energy presents challenges<lb/> to system operations on account of the uncertain and variable output of renewable sources.<lb/> These challenges are emerging in several leading countries and have been analysed in several<lb/> recent publications, including Smith et al (2010), DENA (2010), Neuhoff, K et al. (2011) and the IEA<lb/> (2006 and 2011), Eirgrid and Soni (2011) and NREL (2011).<lb/></table>

			<p>This section examines the challenges associated with the integration of increasing shares of<lb/> variable renewable energy (VRE) for system operations. These challenges are not new, since it has<lb/> always been necessary to handle variable demand and uncertainty regarding possible<lb/> contingencies. However, at high penetration levels of variable renewables, i.e. above 20% of<lb/> annual generation, the increase of variability and uncertainty leads to new challenges. The four<lb/> challenges are summarized in the following table.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 4 • Overview of operating challenges of renewable integration<lb/></table>

			<head>Peak load generation adequacy<lb/></head>

			<p>Generation adequacy is the ability of the electricity system to meet electricity demand with a<lb/> reasonably high probability during periods of high load. The system operator needs to have<lb/> enough capacity available during the hours where electricity demand is the highest, plus a reserve<lb/> margin to cope with contingencies. Adequacy is generally assessed using indicators such as the<lb/> probability of lost load or the expected duration of load curtailment.<lb/></p>

			<p>The maximum output of wind and solar generation vary according to weather conditions and time<lb/> of day. Consequently, assessing the amount of power they can be expected to produce with a<lb/> reasonable degree of confidence when demand is the highest is challenging. This &quot; capacity credit &quot;<lb/> of renewables depends on the correlation between wind, sun and demand. (If solar generation<lb/> correlates with peak demand due to air conditioning, as is the case in California, then the capacity<lb/> credit may be</p>

			<table>high.) According to recent IEA estimates, capacity credits of solar and wind range<lb/> from 0% to 20% of their installed nominal capacity in different regions (IEA, 2011a and IEA,<lb/> 2011c). Other studies indicate higher capacity credit of 38% for solar (PJM, 2010).

			<p>Low capacity credits imply that dispatchable capacity must still be available to balance variability<lb/> of some renewables and ensure adequacy. Despite investments in variable renewable generation<lb/> capacity, other resources such as the conventional plants, demand response and storage will be<lb/> needed to ensure adequacy. In the medium term, conventional generation is bound to take the<lb/> bulk of this function. These conventional plants run less frequently and produce less energy,<lb/> which changes their economics and therefore tend to favour less capital-intensive technologies,<lb/> such as open-cycle gas turbines, instead of combined-cycle gas turbines.<lb/></p>

			<head>Minimum load balancing<lb/></head>

			<p>The opposite of peak load, minimum load balancing refers to the need to maintain generation<lb/> equal to the load during periods of low consumption, generally on Sundays or during the summer<lb/> period of cold climate countries. These situations of minimum residual load do not necessarily<lb/> occur during periods of low demand and they have implications for all markets, including the day-<lb/>ahead market, intra-day or balancing and ancillary services markets. Little consideration has been<lb/> given to these situations of low load, as it is usually sufficient to shut down plants during a few<lb/> days or at night time when they are not needed.<lb/></p>

			<p>To date, while wind and solar do not exceed 20% in Germany Ireland and Texas, there is already<lb/> enough to see the first signs of operating tensions during low load hours:<lb/> 1. Wind can be the marginal fuel when wind generation exceeds load, as it is the case in the<lb/> West Zone of Texas (<ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>);<lb/></p>

			<p>2. Wind generation has to be curtailed in Ireland by about 1% of total wind output and up to<lb/> 7.5% of wind output for certain wind farms (<ref type="biblio">Eirgrid and Soni, 2011</ref>), in order to maintain<lb/> electricity security given current operation practices; 13<lb/> 3. Negative prices can occur if wind has to be dispatched and conventional load are running at<lb/> their minimal technical level and want to avoid shut down for economic reasons or must be<lb/> kept online for system security reason (<ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 13 • Marginal fuel frequency, ERCOT, West Zone<lb/> Source: Potomac Economics, 2010 State of the Market Report for ERCOT.<lb/> Figure 14 • Unused wind generation (MWh) Jan‐Nov 2010<lb/> Source: Eirgrid and Soni (2011).<lb/> Page | 39<lb/></figure>

			<p>Negative prices can result when there are high levels of renewable energy, because the primary<lb/> energy source of fuel is costless and renewable energy is frequently subsidised through feed‐in<lb/> tariffs paid if electricity is generated. Frequent and sustained negative prices will lead to<lb/> depressed revenues for units at the margin and this is likely to have an impact on the viability of<lb/> existing conventional generation. As variable renewable generation becomes a significant source<lb/> of energy across many IEA member countries there are arguments that the policies designed to<lb/> favour renewable energy may need to adapt so that there is more coherence across fuels.<lb/></p>

			<p>Spain has successfully adapted its electricity system to accommodate a very significant share of<lb/> variable renewable energy (in 2011, wind and solar generated 18.3% of energy), a paucity of<lb/> interconnections of the Spanish peninsular system. New legislation (Royal Decree 1565/2010)<lb/> entered into force and the system operator Red Eléctrica de España (REE) has taken several<lb/> actions, notably developing the first national Control Centre for Renewable Energies (CECRE), the<lb/> introduction of a new grid code, the increased participation of wind generation to voltage control,<lb/> and the increase of demand‐side management (REE, 2012). Looking forward, the development of<lb/> storage technologies and the development of international interconnections are foreseen to<lb/> further facilitate the integration of wind and solar power.<lb/></p>

			<p>As variable renewables reach 20% to 30% of electricity generated, there will be a multiplication of<lb/> situations of &quot; excess &quot; renewable generation, which indicates that balancing areas have become<lb/> saturated. In these situations, balancing the power system during periods of low load will<lb/> necessitate further adaptations to maintain the physical parameters of the network. An ongoing<lb/> IEA work within the Grid Integration of Variable Renewables project (GIVAR) analyses these<lb/> options in more detail. This includes the following:<lb/></p>

			<p> Consuming more power during periods of low load, either by final consumers or by electricity<lb/> storage facilities such as pumped‐hydro;<lb/></p>

			<p> Exporting more through interconnection capacity. However, if neighbouring systems have<lb/> also reached high penetration levels, this interconnection is only a viable option to the extent<lb/></p>

			<p>The technical and economic potential to increase demand may be limited, interconnections are<lb/> slow to develop and provide only a partial solution. Hence, it will be necessary in the next<lb/> 20 years to keep some conventional power plants online to provide ancillary services and ramp‐up<lb/> capabilities. Consequently, renewables also will have to play an increasing role to balance the<lb/> network during low load situations. <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref> shows this issue with a modelled load duration<lb/> curve corresponding to 80% of renewables in an isolated balancing area. During periods with low<lb/> load or excess generation, wind and solar will probably have to reduce their output to maintain<lb/> network security.<lb/></p>

			<p>Minimum load balancing constraints have important implications for the design of both<lb/> renewable support mechanisms and the design of electricity markets. As more wind and more<lb/> solar power plants are coming on line, granting them priority dispatch only constrained by<lb/> security of supply reasons may become highly uneconomical. Instead, renewable plants could<lb/> participate in the market by providing a dollar per MWh bid below which they are no longer<lb/> willing to generate. These bids should reflect the marginal cost of production of the plants (which<lb/> is close to zero).<lb/></p>

			<p>Renewable curtailment on economic grounds immediately yields another question: which<lb/> renewable plants should be dispatched? To that end, a locational marginal pricing framework<lb/> would be helpful to attain the least cost dispatch and curtailment decisions should reflect the<lb/> impact of different renewable generators on losses and congestions on the network.<lb/> From a technical standpoint, steps are also being taken by wind plant designers to enable greater<lb/> flexibility in operation of the plant themselves (<ref type="biblio">Smith et al, 2010</ref>). Active power control algorithms<lb/> can limit wind plant output during curtailment events. Reactive power control is also available to<lb/> enable voltage control of the plant output, even at no load in some cases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ramps and start-ups<lb/></head>

			<p>Reliable operation of the power system requires real time matching of supply and demand, which<lb/> implies ramping the aggregated output up and down. The graph below shows that traditional<lb/> variability of consumption in France can typically increase by 6.5 to 7.5 GW in one hour between<lb/> 6:00 and 7:00 for a typical winter day, during which generation has to be ramped up accordingly.<lb/> Different generation technologies can contribute to meet ramp-up needs; nuclear reactors must<lb/> be already operating in a part load mode, below their available output, so as to be able to ramp<lb/> up during the morning hours. Other generation plants such as hydro and gas turbines can<lb/> technically provide high ramp rates and can be made available to follow load.<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 17 • Electricity consumption in France on 22 March 2012<lb/></head>

			<p>Increased penetration of wind and solar will change the shape of the residual demand curve that<lb/> needs to be followed by conventional generation plants. Flexibility of conventional plants (ramp-<lb/>up/down, startup/shutdown, reserve capabilities, etc.) might be more frequently and intensively<lb/> called upon. Modelling results (<ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>) for the United Kingdom with a very high share of<lb/> renewables (80%) and a wind-heavy portfolio shows many hours of excess VRE output (negative<lb/> residual load). The hourly variation in residual load could exceed 10 GW/hour and can reach<lb/> 40 GW/hour during windy hours (about half of the system peak load), should wind benefit from<lb/> priority dispatch run at available output.<lb/></p>

			<p>Ensuring network reliability under such conditions will require a series of actions, including relying<lb/> on storage and demand response. Interconnections will be particularly valuable for the<lb/> aggregation of loads in different countries and to smooth wind output variations when a weather<lb/> front passes through wind plants distributed over hundred of kilometres.<lb/> However, the ramping capability is not generally perceived as a major barrier for the deployment<lb/> of renewables in the foreseeable future for several reasons:<lb/></p>

			<figure>+6.5 GW<lb/> MW<lb/> 50 000<lb/> 52 000<lb/> 54 000<lb/> 56 000<lb/> 58 000<lb/> 60 000<lb/> 62 000<lb/> 64 000<lb/></figure>

			<p>Page | 42<lb/> spinning reserve and &quot; up ramp &quot; service. The extent to which this will take place will depend<lb/> on the relative economic merits compared to other options. Similarly, the ability to enable a<lb/> limit in the &quot; up &quot; ramp of renewables can be technically possible during normal operations and<lb/> has proven to be very helpful in maintaining reliable operations (<ref type="biblio">Smith et al., 2010</ref>).<lb/> Conversely, when large &quot; down &quot; ramp of renewables are forecasted, renewable output may be<lb/> reduced in advance so as to control the ramp rates, if this is the most economic choice for the<lb/> system.<lb/> At present, in many electricity markets, wind and solar generally do not participate in the supply<lb/> of ramping needs. Exposing variable renewables to the electricity and balancing markets risks can<lb/> change this behaviour, as undistorted markets could provide for a level playing field of a sufficient<lb/> quality and quantity of flexible reserves. Where organised markets are mandatory, it may be<lb/> required to define new products, for instance standardized flexibility products that could reveal a<lb/> price for flexibility. Renewables should also be able to participate in these markets.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 18 • Hourly variability of residual load with high shares of renewables (United Kingdom with 80%<lb/> of renewables)<lb/></figure>

			<p>The number of cycling and start‐ups of power plants is also expected to increase with high shares<lb/> of variable renewables. Typically, a gas power plant will need to operate during morning peak<lb/> demand, then stops generating when the sun is shining during the day and then resumes<lb/> operations for the evening peak, before stopping it at night when demand is lower. This will add<lb/> start‐up costs, and reducing the expected technical life time of some assets. While state‐of‐the‐art<lb/> CCGTs are capable of start and stop operations, most of the installed capacity has not been<lb/> designed to be operated in such an intermittent mode. In addition, existing market design does<lb/> not necessarily provide an adequate remuneration of these start‐up and cycling costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Predictability<lb/></head>

			<p>In addition to being variable, wind and solar generation are also uncertain. Whereas demand<lb/> uncertainty on a day‐ahead time‐scale is typically in the range of 1‐2% of load, the mean absolute<lb/> error for wind is 15%, 24 hours before real time. Commercial providers of forecasting solutions<lb/> claim that they can reach a forecast error to 5%, 24 hours before real time. 14 Centralisation of<lb/> information concerning weather forecasts and improvements of forecasting models will reduce<lb/> this uncertainty. On the other hand, higher penetration of wind and solar will add to the<lb/> uncertainty of day‐ahead scheduling, day‐ahead transmission analysis and security‐constrained,<lb/> unit commitment program.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is also a risk that large off‐shore wind farms are set out during storms (storm protection<lb/> shut‐down typically happens at wind speeds above 25 metre/second). In that case, a high<lb/> expected output from off‐shore wind is not delivered.<lb/> Uncertain wind and solar generation forecasts increase the need for flexibility closer to real time.<lb/> As a result, wind uncertainty may yield a need to redefine the amount of reserves required to<lb/> maintain the standard of power system security. In Spain, REE estimated that +0.5 GW of<lb/> additional reserves are needed for 10 GW of wind. In Germany,</p>

			<table>DENA (2010) forecasts + 3 GW of<lb/> additional reserves for 36 GW of VRE by 2015.<lb/></table>

			<p>To provide this type of flexibility, demand response can be a competitive solution. Low‐cost<lb/> demand responses already exist in many markets, such as Denmark, where district heating<lb/> providers have installed boilers. The existing potential of low‐cost demand response for large<lb/> users running capital intensive factories or industrial facilities must be assessed and the pace of<lb/> development of smart grids remains uncertain.<lb/></p>

			<p>Other strategies can be developed to control balancing costs. Large balancing areas and<lb/> geographic diversity of wind resources can help to optimise the balancing costs. Improving the<lb/> design of electricity markets is another important lever to control these costs. In several US<lb/> markets and in Australia, sub‐hourly energy markets are integrated and co‐optimised with<lb/> ancillary services markets. In Europe, where balancing services are traded on separate markets<lb/> than energy, balancing prices are correlated to energy prices but tend to be more expensive. As a<lb/> result, utilities prefer to reschedule their unit commitment program of their own portfolio of<lb/> power plants rather than being exposed to the balancing market. In that case, allowing intra‐day<lb/> trade and rescheduling until one hour before real time could reduce the exposure to the<lb/> balancing market risk and lower the balancing costs for market participants (IEA, 2011d).<lb/></p>

			<p>already pointed out,<lb/> &quot; These policy concerns have not disappeared. On the contrary, they are now exacerbated by<lb/> the consequences of increasing shares of policy‐driven variable renewables, which can further<lb/> undermine the functioning of electricity markets and may distort incentives to invest. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>The market and regulatory frameworks are keys to electricity security of supply, also expressed in<lb/> terms of reliability and generation adequacy. In most cases, these concerns have been raised<lb/> because policy makers have observed a reduction of profitability of existing assets, with some<lb/> generators planning to mothball power plants that may be necessary to meet system load at<lb/> times of low variable RE generation. In some markets, most notably continental Europe, the<lb/> absence of investments does not necessarily put generation adequacy at risk. On the contrary, in<lb/> a situation of economic crisis, slow electricity demand growth and excess capacity, stopping<lb/> investments is exactly what we expect from well‐functioning electricity markets. Several<lb/> countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, Greece and Spain enjoy comfortable<lb/> reserve margins and enough flexible gas‐fired capacity to accommodate high shares of variable<lb/> renewables and do not need investments in the next ten years.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, ageing and polluting power plants built in the 1970s will be retired in the coming years<lb/> in many OECD countries. In some cases, policy makers forecast shrinking reserve margins but little<lb/> evidence of adequate investments in new generating capacity. This is the case of Ercot in Texas,<lb/> California and the United Kingdom. This new investment cycle will constitute a major test for<lb/> competitive markets and one of the last opportunities to decarbonise the electricity mix by 2050.<lb/> Many economists, as well as the IEA (2007), recommend well‐functioning electricity markets as<lb/> the efficient solution, provided that prices can rise high enough during periods of scarcity, and<lb/> that there is a stable regulatory framework. Yet a growing number of countries have recently<lb/> adopted new rules mandating system operators to contract for generation capacity (New Zealand,<lb/> Ontario, California, Norway and Sweden) or have introduced explicit margin or capacity targets<lb/> (PJM, Italy, Australia&apos;s eastern states and Latin America). Many other countries are actively<lb/> introducing new regulatory arrangements to ensure that enough capacity will be available in the<lb/> future to ensure reliable system operations (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Belgium).<lb/></p>

			<p>In this section we find that, based on the analysis of the experience in several OECD countries,<lb/> there are a number of imperfections in market design and uncertainties about energy policy that<lb/> substantially increase the risk associated with new investments in generation capacity. These<lb/> factors are tending to delay investment decisions. If this situation is allowed to persist, it will lead<lb/> to underinvestment in generating capacity, and to higher prices or involuntary rolling blackouts.<lb/> These problems are currently exacerbated by the ongoing economic and financial crisis in Europe,<lb/> which reduces the appetite for high risk investment, and by issues with local acceptance that can<lb/> increase the lead time of new projects.<lb/> Page | 46<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 20 • Overview of investment issues<lb/></head>

			<p>Most of the issues associated with investment in new generating capacity pertain to the energy<lb/> industry itself and reflect real or expected problems with the design of wholesale electricity<lb/> markets and the impact that energy and climate policies have on electricity markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is often argued that electricity markets do not provide sufficient certainty of revenues to attract<lb/> investment, either for peaking units, mid‐merit power plants or for low‐carbon investments. In<lb/> addition, high shares of variable renewables increase the price and load factor risks. In other<lb/> words, expected prices may be quite high, but too unpredictable and too volatile to ensure a<lb/> proper remuneration of the cost of capital (risk‐adjusted) used by investors to evaluate<lb/> investments in new generation capacity in liberalised markets. Even if prices can be very high<lb/> during a few hours, these peak price episodes are too rare and provide irregular/intermittent<lb/> revenues that may fail to attract enough investment in new generation to meet reliability criteria.<lb/></p>

			<p>The argument is similar for low‐carbon investments. According to this view, long‐lived and high<lb/> fixed cost, low‐carbon investments are exposed to the electricity market price risk, which depend<lb/> not only on volatile and uncertain fossil fuel prices like coal and gas; but also on carbon price risk.<lb/> In addition, some low‐carbon investments such as nuclear and CCS could be exposed to the load<lb/> factor risk associated with high deployment of variable renewables. If market players are usually<lb/> well‐equipped to handle fossil fuel price risk, they are less well placed to tackle the carbon price<lb/> risk and renewable policy risk, in particular, the risk of a low‐carbon price. These arguments then<lb/> lead to conclude that liberalised electricity sectors can provide neither the low‐carbon investment<lb/> needed, nor the investments in conventional generation to ensure security of supply at<lb/> reasonable cost.<lb/></p>

			<table>It is often also argued that, in addition to being volatile, wholesale electricity prices and ancillary<lb/> services cannot provide sufficient revenues to attract adequate investments. One reason is that<lb/> prices can not go high enough to cover both operating costs and capital investment costs required<lb/> to trigger investment in new capacity. These peak pricing restrictions are known in the economics<lb/> literature as the missing money problem.

We will refer to this problem as the<lb/> missing market problem.<lb/> Market participants often state that energy policy risk may make the electricity industry difficult<lb/> to invest ( &quot; uninvestable &quot; ). Market rules change too frequently. Government or regulators have<lb/> opportunities to &quot; hold‐up &quot; incumbents by imposing new regulatory constraints in the future or<lb/> deploying policies affecting negatively the profitability of previous investments. Energy policies<lb/> may be too costly and exposed to backlash from taxpayers or ratepayers. This creates an unstable<lb/> investment environment and the lack of credibility of some policies acts as a deterrent to new<lb/> investments. Furthermore, the lack of commitment towards liberalization and unceasing<lb/> discussions concerning further market reforms tend to delay investment decisions, in order to<lb/> wait for announced evolutions of the regulatory framework, as real option theory would suggest.<lb/> The perspective to have regulatory intervention in case of generation adequacy problem may<lb/> create a self‐fulfilling prophecy.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of these generation investment issues, with<lb/> a particular focus to the implications of energy policies undertaken by governments.<lb/></p>

			<head>The impact of the financial and economic crisis<lb/></head>

			<p>In the wake of the financial crisis which started in 2008, the situation in the banking industry<lb/> made it virtually impossible to finance any kind of conventional power plant on a project‐finance<lb/> basis. Previously in the 2000s, several merchant gas power plants in the United States filed for<lb/> bankruptcy. Given the current financial context, securing financing is increasingly difficult for<lb/> project developers to achieve.<lb/> The banking industry argues that investment is therefore likely to come mainly from utilities at<lb/> the moment, and financed on balance sheet. But even this will be limited owing to the fact that<lb/> most utilities, even large ones, have to face low profitability of existing assets, and issues in terms<lb/> of equity and credit rating. Indeed, they suffer from the consequences of the economic crisis<lb/> which has created excess generating capacity and low electricity prices, reducing their EBITDA and<lb/> constraining their ability to invest. This is particularly a concern when it comes to financing large<lb/> projects such as nuclear power plants or large off‐shore wind farms, owing to the fact that only<lb/> one of those multibillion investment projects is enough to have an impact on the credit rating of<lb/> even the largest utilities. These factors tend to increase the weighted average cost of capital<lb/> (WACC) used by utilities to finance new projects.<lb/> In addition, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the recession in some countries, financial<lb/> regulatory changes (most notably Basel 3 tighter capital adequacy requirement) and the<lb/> restructuring of financial institutions, all these elements create one of the most challenging<lb/> environment for banks to finance any investment in general, and the more risky ones in<lb/> particular. Bank credit rationing can lead to situations where investment projects with a positive<lb/> net present value, are not built because of lack of financing.<lb/> It is often argued that the electricity sector will need to rely on new categories of investors<lb/> (pension funds or sovereign investors); in order to find the trillion dollars needed to finance the<lb/> new investments in the coming decades to replace ageing capacity and decarbonise the electricity<lb/> mix. However, attracting these investors is not free lunch and would call for serving them an<lb/> appropriate risk‐return proposition. Moreover, these pure financial players are less familiar with<lb/> the specificities and subtle market design issues of electricity markets. As such, they are less able<lb/> to find proper risk mitigation strategies and thus will either not invest or add a risk premium on<lb/> their cost of capital, increasing their expected returns on investment in the power generation<lb/></p>

			<p>Page | 48<lb/> industry. Indeed, the most important issue for investors to tackle seems to be the revenue risk of<lb/> new power plants, as investors engage in a &quot; flight to quality &quot; in the current uncertain<lb/> macroeconomic times.<lb/> Interestingly, financing is not an issue for all generation investments. Renewable projects<lb/> continue to attract proper financing, even in period of tight financing conditions. Unlike the case<lb/> of market‐based investments, they benefit from feed‐in tariffs, priority dispatch or alternatively,<lb/> power purchase agreements (PPA). This suggests that revenue risk is a key topic in the electricity<lb/> sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>More basically, investments in some markets, in particular in Europe, do not happen just because<lb/> they are not needed. With the notable exception of the United Kingdom, most European<lb/> countries enjoy comfortable reserve margins, excess capacity and generation adequacy is not a<lb/> concern for the next 10 years (ENTSO‐E, 2010).<lb/></p>

			<head>Local acceptability issues<lb/></head>

			<p>IEA member countries are increasingly confronted with local acceptability issues in their day‐to<lb/> day activities. This effect is often referred to as &quot; build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone &quot;<lb/> (BANANA). While this is mainly a concern for transmission network development, because a<lb/> transmission line has a significant impact on landscapes, finding new sites in some densely<lb/> populated IEA countries is becoming an issue.<lb/> Nuclear power, gas and coal‐fired power plants have also to face anti‐nuclear groups or local<lb/> opposition and new projects tend to be located on existing nuclear or industrial sites. Overall,<lb/> acceptability issues increase the public consultation duration and administrative burden and carry<lb/> the risk of delay of the projects. While this concern is not specific to the energy industry, its<lb/> consequences can be particularly important in the electricity sector if a country faces a shortage<lb/> of suitable sites. Failure to build new capacity on time may lead to situations where electricity<lb/> security cannot be ensured on a national basis. If this is the case, interconnections can contribute<lb/> to ensure security of electricity supply.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cash flow volatility and variability<lb/> Uncertain revenues for peaking units<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity markets are characterized by high price volatility due to inelastic demand and volatile<lb/> demand and supply. Potential investors in new generating capacity must expect to cover their<lb/> variable operating and fuel costs, their operation and maintenance costs and their capital costs<lb/> from sale of energy over the lifetime of the power plant. The profitability of generating units that<lb/> are likely to operate only for a relatively small number of hours in each year (peaking capacity) is<lb/> especially sensitive to the level of prices that are realized during the small number of high<lb/> demand hours in which they provide energy or operating reserves.<lb/> Due to yearly variability on the demand and the supply side, these hours erratically fluctuate from<lb/> year to year. <ref type="figure">Figure 21</ref> shows</p>

			<figure>the notional revenues calculated for a peak power plant in Australia.<lb/> A gas fired power plant running only when prices are above 1000 AUS$/MWh would have earned<lb/> revenues above annual costs only two years in the period 2006‐2011, corresponding to two dry<lb/> years. While average revenues are higher than the average annualized cost of OCGT, such a cash<lb/> flow profile implies a long sequence of losses for investors.<lb/> © OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 49<lb/> Figure 21 • Cost and revenues of notional peaking gas‐fired generators in the South Australian wholesale<lb/> Market, 2006‐2011<lb/></figure>

			<p>The price spikes due to scarcity events may be further magnified by other factors such as demand<lb/> growth uncertainty, boom‐bust investment cycles, market power, or regulatory or political<lb/> interventions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Policy‐driven development of variable renewable generation can also increase variability on the<lb/> supply side. The probability of having a heat wave or a cold spell is low. The probability that either<lb/> will occur at the same time as a period of low wind and solar output is even lower, which could<lb/> result in scarcity events becoming rarer.<lb/></p>

			<head>Do gas plants benefit from a natural hedge on electricity markets?<lb/></head>

			<p>Under current market arrangements, wholesale electricity prices reflect the marginal cost of the<lb/> marginal power plant and are thus driven primarily by fossil fuel prices (and where they exist, a<lb/> carbon price). As a result, fossil generators thus benefit from a natural hedge: the difference<lb/> between the electricity sales price and the cost of fuel (the spread) is reasonably stable. However,<lb/> looking to it more carefully, coal and gas power plants have been competing with each other<lb/> intensely, and as a result, one of them can get shifted off the marginal fuel. The key factors<lb/> affecting their position on the merit order are relative coal and gas prices, carbon price and<lb/> residual demand left for thermal generation after renewable plants are dispatched.<lb/> In Germany for example, high gas prices combined with a low‐carbon price have led coal to<lb/> become the dominant marginal fuel and set the clearing price. Gas plants are too expensive given<lb/> the current price of gas. Similarly, in the Netherlands, reduction in coal prices in the last few years<lb/> has resulted in much fewer run hours of even most efficient gas plants.<lb/> Looking forward, coal and gas prices are difficult to project. Assuming that the carbon price in<lb/> Europe will rise significantly, this should give an advantage to gas‐fired plants, let them set the<lb/> marginal price and therefore become more &quot; self‐hedged &quot; , as they used to be perceived until a<lb/> few years ago. Although, the degree of the advantage the higher carbon price can give to gas<lb/> generation will depend on the relativity of coal and gas prices.<lb/></p>

			<head>Impact of VRE on revenues of mid‐merit plants<lb/></head>

			<p>High shares of wind and solar also increase the daily volatility as well as the quarterly and yearly<lb/> variability of revenues for mid‐merit plants such as CCGTs. These plants are running less hours<lb/> and they have to recoup fixed costs during a reduced number of hours which vary from one year<lb/> to the other, depending in particular on weather conditions.<lb/> While this was an issue mainly for peaking units, the deployment of variable renewable increases<lb/> the variability of revenues for mid merit power plants. Having less predictable and more volatile<lb/> cash flows, mid‐merit power plants are more difficult to finance and this could ultimately lead to<lb/> underinvestment if the proper incentives are not restored.<lb/></p>

			<head>Long‐term contracts and vertical integration<lb/></head>

			<p>It is often proposed that long‐term contracts reflect average spot market prices and could partly<lb/> smooth revenues over time. However, these cash flows are very volatile and it may not be<lb/> possible to find counterparties willing to enter into forward contracts of ten or more years&apos;<lb/> duration to allow investors to hedge such market risks. Furthermore, even if there are no price<lb/> restrictions, price uncertainty will affect the cost of capital used by investors to evaluate projects.<lb/> As Joskow (2007) pointed out, the example of other industries shows that investors finance oil<lb/> refineries, cruise chips and other costly capital projects where there is considerable price<lb/> uncertainty without the security of long term contracts.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the electricity sector, retail suppliers of electricity are exposed to wholesale price risk. Partial<lb/> vertical integration between retail supply and generation ownership is emerging in Europe and in<lb/> the US. This can be analysed as an industry response that addresses the issue of financing<lb/> investments and dealing with imperfections in wholesale spot markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Low‐carbon investments<lb/></head>

			<p>In Europe, the carbon price is foreseen to be the cornerstone of climate policies and to promote<lb/> low‐carbon investment in the power sector, replacing renewable support policies as these<lb/> technologies reach maturity. In principle, this could work if, despite the risk associated with short‐<lb/> term volatility of electricity prices and long‐term uncertainty over fossil fuel prices, low‐carbon<lb/></p>

The higher the carbon price, the more low‐carbon investments are made.<lb/> However, the carbon price alone is currently too low in Europe to support nuclear and renewable<lb/> power investment. Assuming a higher carbon price, investors may fear political intervention,<lb/> which undermines the future credibility of the carbon price.<lb/> Confronted with this situation, the UK Administration&apos;s proposed solution has been to introduce<lb/> long‐term contracts that take away electricity market price risk from investors, and are legally<lb/> enforceable and hence credible in a way that the carbon price − even a carbon price floor − is not.<lb/> This proposal, where the government picks up the technologies and transfers part of the risk to<lb/> taxpayers, is a quite noticeable change in the United Kingdom, which pioneered electricity<lb/> liberalisation in the 1990s.<lb/> Another important question regarding low‐carbon investment concerns the functioning of<lb/> electricity markets when marginal costs are low and investment costs of each plant are high. One<lb/> often mentioned issue is that market prices with high shares of renewables would reduce prices<lb/> and undermine the incentives to invest, even with a high carbon price. According to this analysis,<lb/> investments in low‐carbon generation would stop once prices are too low, and may not deliver<lb/> the investment needed in the nearly full decarbonisation scenarios foreseen in 2050. This issue<lb/> calls for further research.<lb/></table>

			<head>Load factor risk<lb/></head>

			<p>Policy‐induced renewable capacity development, like in Germany or Spain, relies on feed‐in tariffs<lb/> or other support mechanisms which are higher than the electricity price. As a result, there is no<lb/> coordination between demand and investments. On the contrary, while electricity consumption<lb/> has been slowing down, governments have accelerated renewable investments since 2008. The<lb/> implication for Europe is that the residual demand to conventional generators in 2011 was equal<lb/> to the level of 2002.<lb/></p>

In addition, the average price<lb/> levels decrease, negative or zero prices can happen, and peaking units are running fewer hours.<lb/> As depicted in the Figure 24 below, it is possible for the sake of the analysis to separate two<lb/> effects: the load duration factor (or compression effect) and the price effect.<lb/></table>

			<p>The load factor effect and price effects combine to reduce the profitability of the existing fleet of<lb/> power plants in the short term. Solar generates power during the day, when consumption is<lb/> generally higher. The rapid deployment of solar PV in several European countries has the effect of<lb/> flattening the residual daily demand curve, which used to be served by mid‐merit power plants.<lb/> From this perspective, it could be argued that rapid deployment of renewable energy &quot; holds up &quot;<lb/> existing conventional power plant investment. The major risk here is that renewables push<lb/> existing plants out the market, leading to mothballing. Note that if these mothballed plants are<lb/> needed to meet peak demand for their ramp‐up capability or to contribute to ancillary services,<lb/> then the corresponding markets should remunerate properly (an issue which is discussed later).<lb/> This analysis suggests that the impact of renewables on the generation capacity mix depends not<lb/> only on the target, but also on the pace of deployment of renewables. Green and Vasilakos (2011)<lb/> and NEA (2012) use a simplified model to compute the optimal equilibrium generating mix based<lb/> on a residual load duration curve. In this optimal generation mix, the share of different<lb/> technologies will evolve into less base load and more peak units. But it is remarkable that the<lb/> effect on prices should remain limited in the long run once the system has reached a new<lb/> equilibrium, assuming constant carbon and fuel prices. The reason is that the &quot; equilibrium<lb/> durations &quot; between different technologies depend on the cost composition of different<lb/> generation technologies but are independent from the shape of the residual load duration curve.<lb/> During the transition to low‐carbon electricity, the rate of deployment of renewables may exceed<lb/> the demand growth rate and the need to replace of ageing capacity. Taking a dynamic view, the<lb/> load factor of conventional power plants will not be constant over time, but will be reduced as<lb/> renewables are deployed. Consequently, it is possible to anticipate that a new power plant will<lb/> initially be operated at a higher load factor, and then at a lower utilisation rate, selecting the right<lb/> mix of technologies to serve such a declining market.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another issue regarding load factors is their quarterly or yearly variability due to weather<lb/> conditions. The number of hours with prices above variable costs may be difficult to predict,<lb/> increasing the risk for potential investors. While already the case for peaking units, this will also<lb/> become an issue for mid‐merit units.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a result, the load factor risk is an issue, but it may be limited mainly to the profitability of<lb/> existing plants in the short run. Our analysis does not suggest that this will be a major issue for<lb/> security of supply, as long as companies investing in new plants are able to anticipate carbon<lb/> prices and levels of development of renewable energy; this will be discussed later in the section<lb/> on regulatory risk. For new investments, the optimal generation mix may evolve over time<lb/> towards less capital‐intensive power plants and will depend on future carbon prices and<lb/> expectations of load factors and of their variability.<lb/></p>

			<head>Peak pricing restrictions<lb/></head>

			<p>There is a concern that competitive wholesale electricity markets for energy and operating<lb/> reserves do not provide sufficient net revenues to attract adequate investment in generation<lb/> capacity to meet conventional reliability criteria. More precisely, the spot wholesale electricity<lb/> price may not be high enough to cover the operating and capital investment costs required to<lb/> attract capacity. This problem is often referred to as the missing &quot; money problem &quot; in the<lb/> academic literature. There is a lot of empirical evidence in the United States suggesting that<lb/> revenues are lower than the cost of new entry in the market. <ref type="figure">Figure 25</ref> shows that the gas power<lb/> plant revenues from energy and ancillary services markets in the United States rarely exceed the<lb/> cost of new entry (a rough estimate is 60 USD/kW per year), except in the congested New York<lb/> area. Remuneration from capacity markets that have been introduced in PJM and NYISO<lb/> represent a significant share of gas plants revenues.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is well established that prices during peak hours, when there are scarcity conditions, must be<lb/> very high to cover the fixed cost of peaking units and also contribute to the fixed cost of other<lb/> mid‐merit and base‐load power plants (<ref type="biblio">Boiteux, 1949</ref>). In a market context, the price formation<lb/> process during peak hours characterised by operating reserve shortage is critical for<lb/> understanding whether the market is providing the right signals. However, there are a number of<lb/> wholesale market imperfections and regulatory restrictions on prices, as well as procedures<lb/> utilised by system operators to maintain network security (<ref type="biblio">Joskow, 2007; Cramton and Stoft,<lb/> 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>System operations during scarcity conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>Only a small fraction of consumers are responding to real time prices (usually a few percent of the<lb/> total load) and this situation will probably remain so at least until the development of smart grids,<lb/> smart homes and smart appliances allow differentiation of usages of electricity according to<lb/> customers&apos; preferences. The consequence is that system operators rely on out‐of‐market<lb/> operations to maintain reliable network operations and avoid non‐price rationing of demand<lb/> (rolling blackouts). The engineering procedures often rely on bilateral contracting with specific<lb/> power plants for network reliability reasons, asking consumers to reduce consumption without<lb/> compensation to maintain security of supply during tight hours, accepting capacity margins below<lb/> their normal level or ultimately reducing voltage. All these actions have the effect of depressing<lb/> peak prices during scarcity conditions and have been presented as the main explanation of the<lb/> missing money problem (<ref type="biblio">Joskow, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Market power<lb/></head>

			<p>Periods of high demand are those when market power problems are likely to be most severe. If<lb/> capacity is scarce, suppliers even with a small percentage of the market could exercise extreme<lb/> market power. After these peak prices, regulators monitor markets carefully (e.g. energy<lb/> regulators monitor peak prices in several countries, including France) and control bids. In some<lb/> jurisdictions, regulators impose price caps to mitigate market power during peak hours.<lb/></p>

			<p>Market power is a feature of most electricity markets and this can lead to underinvestment in<lb/> generation capacity, maintaining prices higher than their efficient level (<ref type="biblio">Léautier, 2012</ref>) and<lb/> justifying price caps to mitigate market power. In markets which are not sufficiently competitive,<lb/> it is argued that binding price caps are the cause − not the consequence − of under‐investments<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Léautier, 2012</ref>). In that case, removing price restrictions would not necessarily yield adequate<lb/> generation capacity but would only increase monopoly profits. Similarly, capacity mechanisms<lb/> would also probably increase monopoly profits.<lb/></p>

			<head>Political interventions<lb/></head>

			<p>There is also a risk of political intervention to avoid peak prices. In some countries, sensational<lb/> peak power prices, exceeding 10 or even 100 times the cost of production, are making the<lb/> headlines of newspapers, and these levels of prices are difficult to explain to the public. This<lb/> carries the risk of political interventions to limit price spikes. Anticipation of such political<lb/> interventions may act as a deterrent to investing in power plants that cover their costs through<lb/> peak prices during a limited number of scarcity hours.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 26</ref> illustrates the consequence of restricting peak prices. Revenues are lower for all types<lb/> of power plants, including peak plants, mid‐merit or base‐load plants that under well functioning<lb/> electricity market conditions should also sell their output at the market price. The existence of<lb/> peak price restrictions therefore distorts the market‐based investment decisions, leading to a<lb/> generation mix that is not the least cost‐efficient one.<lb/></p>

			<p>Restricting peak prices is one of the most common rationales for the introduction of further<lb/> market reforms such as capacity markets in several countries. It is therefore crucial to analyse in<lb/> detail the causes of peak price restrictions in order consider all possible solutions, such as<lb/> improving the performance of existing markets, rather than introducing further complex<lb/> regulations such as capacity markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Missing or incomplete flexibility markets<lb/></head>

			<p>The supply of energy and various balancing or ancillary services are different possible usages of<lb/> the same power plant. In general, power plants operating below their maximum output can<lb/> provide ramp‐up capability, but in that case, they lose some revenues as they do not sell all the<lb/> power they could produce on the energy market. Arbitrage links energy market prices with<lb/> balancing and ancillary services prices and this creates opportunities to change the operations of<lb/> generating units according to price incentives delivered on these different interrelated power<lb/> markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Markets for operating reserves and balancing services typically define the relevant products fairly<lb/> crudely. The market for reserves or balancing services may not have any locational dimension.<lb/> Generation services are much more differentiated than the basic underlying commodity with<lb/> which they are associated. The system operator may, for example, need generating capacity<lb/> responding in 10 minutes at a particular node of the network (<ref type="biblio">Joskow, 2007</ref>). When supplies from<lb/> generators with more specific characteristics are needed, the system operator may rely on<lb/> bilateral out‐of‐market contracts to secure these supplies. These out‐of‐market operations can<lb/> inefficiently depress prices received by other market participants for similar services and do not<lb/> create a transparent price signal to operate efficiently and invest in flexible capacity.<lb/></p>

			<p>For instance, if a system operator needs a &quot; quick start &quot; supply or demand response that can supply<lb/> within 15 minutes rather than 30 minutes, it is better to define that as a separate product and to create a<lb/> market for it that is fully integrated with related energy and ancillary service product markets, rather<lb/> than relying on out‐of‐market bilateral arrangements and &quot; must‐run &quot; scheduling (<ref type="biblio">Joskow, 2007</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 57<lb/></figure>

			<p>In addition to short‐term balancing price signals, another issue is that market participants may not<lb/> have the information to accurately forecast the balancing requirements over time, as variable<lb/> renewables become more important on the network. Indeed, balancing services needs differ if<lb/> the system experiences a shortage of quick‐start capability or downward flexibility to handle a<lb/> minimal load situation. However, in most power systems, balancing services tend to be procured<lb/> close to real time, usually after the day‐ahead market, and there are few market design with<lb/> forward markets for balancing services. If system operators were able to anticipate operating<lb/> challenges, forward demand for such balancing products could be created, in order to help<lb/> market participants make the economic case for investments needed to enhance the flexibility of<lb/> existing or new capacity and to contribute to secure power systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 27 • Missing markets<lb/> Energy policy and regulatory risks<lb/></head>

			<p>Investment decisions always involve a bet on future economic conditions. Even in a world of<lb/> perfectly stable regulation, investors still face the macroeconomic &quot; structural &quot; risk of electricity<lb/> demand forecasts errors as well as gas and coal price risk that can substantially affect the<lb/> profitability of large and long lived power plant investments. It is widely acknowledged that this<lb/> structural risk is an integral part of the market risk and it is usually factored in the risk‐adjusted<lb/> cost of capital used in the investment decision process. Furthermore, in competitive markets,<lb/> investors have also to make investment decisions based on strategic interactions with others.<lb/> Strategies may be good or not and may result in boom and bust cycles. But here again, it is widely<lb/> recognized that the risk of poor strategic decisions is an integral part of the market risk.<lb/></p>

			<p>With investments in the power industry being increasingly done through policy‐driven measures,<lb/> it becomes more difficult to draw the line between market risk and policy or regulatory risk. For<lb/> instance, utilities complain about the impact of renewables on the load factor of conventional<lb/> power plants, most notably, the recent gas‐fired combined cycle. According to this view,<lb/></p>

			<head>Figure 28 • Evolution of electricity consumption and non‐renewable consumption in Spain<lb/></head>

			<p>In Australia, the impact of carbon policy uncertainty on generation investment has been<lb/> extensively analysed. A Deloitte report 15 found that policy uncertainty was detrimental to<lb/> investment in baseload electricity, including combined cycle gas turbines, and as a result, OCGT<lb/> was considered the lowest risk investment as it has lower capital costs. Deloitte calculated the<lb/> cost of policy uncertainty, in terms of sub‐optimality in investment, characterised by a preference<lb/> for OCGT rather than OCGT. They estimated the cost of policy uncertainty by</p>

			<table>2016 as<lb/> AUD 4.73/MWh or AUD 1.2 billion/year (in real 2010 dollar). This increased to AUD 4.73/MWh in<lb/> 2020 and in AUD 16/MWh 2024.<lb/></table>

			<p>That is not to say that investors should be insulated from policy and regulatory risk. Industry<lb/> participants usually develop their own views concerning the probability of success of energy<lb/> policies, such as the share of renewables that can be reasonably achieved or the number of<lb/> squared meters of buildings that will be successfully refurbished as a result of energy efficiency<lb/> policies. In other sectors as well, investments in large oil or gas projects in some non‐OECD<lb/> countries also factor in an enhanced risk of expropriation (the expropriation of REPSOL in<lb/> Argentina is a recent example), of legislative instability and other important dimensions of risk.<lb/> Investment decisions are a question of risk/return and diversification of the portfolio of projects.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, energy policies regarding electricity present some characteristics that have the<lb/> potential to undermine investment decisions in new capacity, ultimately raising concerns about<lb/> security of supply. <ref type="figure">Figure 29</ref> provides an illustration of the possible impact of policy uncertainty<lb/> on generation adequacy forecasts. First, policy‐driven renewable energy introduces uncertainties,<lb/> including the pace of deployment of renewables and the existence and ambitions of future<lb/> renewable policies, in particular beyond 2020 in Europe.<lb/> Second, in the light of historical experience, ambitious energy efficiency policies may remain<lb/> tainted with uncertainty, and this will exacerbate demand forecast errors. Aggressive smart<lb/> metering roll outs approved by regulators may or may not deliver the demand response potential<lb/> that can contribute to ensuring security of supply during periods of scarcity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, when governments take actions to address investment issues and wish to create the<lb/> conditions for nuclear investments, these actions can also delay investment decisions. In the<lb/> United Kingdom, the ongoing nuclear policy began in 2008 and the first new nuclear reactors are<lb/> not expected before 2018, if the reform proceeds successfully. After two years of active<lb/> consultations, several barriers must still be removed. Political processes are frequently delayed<lb/> when the attention of governments shifts towards a more pressing topic or if a government<lb/> changes.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 29 • Possible impact of policy uncertainty on adequacy forecasts (*10 GW)<lb/> Source: IEA (2011c), based on WEO CPS and 450 PPM Scenario, OECD Europe.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Confronted with such major uncertainties, the profitability of new capacity can be either positive<lb/> or negative, depending on the outcome of the political process. That is, relying on fossil fuel<lb/> capacity can be extremely profitable under one framework or they can be financially disastrous in<lb/> another. Thinking in terms of real options, investors would wait until the policy framework is<lb/> clarified, before committing to a make a final investment decision. But indefinitely delaying<lb/> decisions carries the risk of tightening supply conditions and deterioration of security of supply.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Policy options<lb/></head>

			<p>Addressing the operating challenges and investment issues discussed in the previous sections will<lb/> require an adaptation of regulatory and market frameworks. Even though countries face different<lb/> supply and demand features, jeopardizing security of electricity supply is never an option.<lb/> However, security of electricity supply in a country with large hydro reservoirs is not the same as<lb/> for a country with a lot of variable wind or, to take another example, an ageing generation<lb/> capacity. Each country will need to find the solution best suited to its situation.<lb/> This section provides an overview of the toolbox for policy makers concerned with electricity<lb/> security aiming to rapidly reduce CO2 emissions from power generation and at the same time to<lb/> preserve or develop liberalised electricity markets. The perspective taken here is the market<lb/> segment of generation, i.e. the segment that is fully exposed to market price risk. The time<lb/> horizon considered is the next 10 to 20 years, corresponding to the period which is relevant for<lb/> the business plans of power projects currently being considered by investors. Note that most of<lb/> the instruments described here are not relevant in electricity systems where investment decisions<lb/> are regulated, where the share of each technology is approved or tendered by a central body.<lb/></p>

			<p>Five sets of policy measures can be identified that contribute directly or indirectly to enhance the<lb/> security of electricity supply. Some of them should be pursued in any case to improve the<lb/> functioning of electricity markets with high shares of renewables, including:<lb/> 1. Improved climate and low‐carbon energy policy instruments: an ongoing, long‐term process;<lb/> 2. Better electricity market design: a no regret solution; and<lb/> 3. Engineering standards and norms: a valuable contribution.<lb/> The rationale and interest of a complementary capacity mechanism, on top of the basic package<lb/> of policy measures, is also discussed.<lb/> 4. Targeted contracting: a temporary fix; and<lb/> 5. Market‐wide capacity mechanism: a safety net.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is possible to define a basic package of policy measures that should be pursued as a priority.<lb/> Specifically, improving climate policies and better energy‐only markets (A, B and C) could bring<lb/> benefits in terms of security of electricity supply. This may solve some of the issues associated<lb/> with increasing shares of variable renewables. While financing peak plants and mid‐merit power<lb/> plants will still need to address the issues associated with cash flow volatility and variability,<lb/> enhanced energy policies and better energy markets can significantly increase investment<lb/> incentives to ensure generation adequacy at least cost. Furthermore, undertaking these measures<lb/> has broader benefits and should therefore be regarded as no regret actions.<lb/> However, implementing the basic package of measures A to C will, at best, take time, and it is also<lb/> possible that governments may fail to implement the appropriate measures. In particular,<lb/> improving the certainty of climate policies for investors may be especially challenging in view of<lb/> the inherent uncertainty associated with climate policies and future technology cost reductions. If<lb/> this is the case, additional measures resulting in further modifications of market arrangements<lb/> should be considered to maintain security of supply. The capacity mechanisms described in D and<lb/> E lead to a significant departure from the market framework described in section 1. They are<lb/> hybrid solutions between energy‐only markets and more heavy‐handed regulation where<lb/> governments contract for all new generation capacity. Nevertheless, such capacity arrangements<lb/> may well be necessary to ensure security of supply during the transition period to cope with some<lb/> regulatory or market failure regarding energy policy uncertainty, the impossibility of preventing<lb/> price restrictions and the lack of certainty of revenues of peak plants and mid merits power<lb/> plants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Improving climate and low‐carbon energy policies instruments:<lb/> an ongoing long‐term process<lb/></head>

			<p>The main purpose here is not to discuss the overall efficiency of climate and renewable policies.<lb/> Nevertheless, a major risk faced by investors in electricity markets comes from the uncertainties<lb/> associated with climate policies (see chapter 2), in that an unexpectedly rapid deployment of low‐<lb/> carbon energy would reduce the market of conventional plants. Conversely, a failure to deploy<lb/> low‐carbon energy would be a upside for conventional plants. Policy makers should take this into<lb/> account when designing policies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The basic measure is to design low‐carbon policies that provide a more predictable framework for<lb/> reliable electricity supply. This includes the design of climate policies, of carbon markets, and low<lb/> carbon generation policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definition of energy and climate policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Findings<lb/></p>

			<table> Stable and predictable climate and low‐carbon policies would have the potential to solve some of<lb/> the problems associated with investment incentives, although technological developments and<lb/> other investment issues are important. Improved climate and low‐carbon policies include<lb/> providing more certainty for carbon prices (or equivalent policies where a carbon price is not yet<lb/> in place); supplementing it by setting targets that are backed with credible policies to ensure<lb/> their delivery; predictable renewables and energy efficiency policies; and avoiding sudden<lb/> reverses in the overall energy strategy.<lb/>  Governments should aim to provide more certainty and predictability, while it has to be<lb/> acknowledged that policies will need to be reviewed and modified over time to reflect changing<lb/> economic conditions, policy successes (or failures), and technology developments.<lb/> Page | 63<lb/></table>

			<head>Carbon pricing policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Uncertainty about global climate policy and regional or national climate policies can deter<lb/> potential investors while they wait for the rules of the game to be more clearly spelled out.<lb/> At the global level, governments can seek to conclude climate negotiations on schedule by 2015<lb/> as agreed in Durban in 2011, to clarify the global framework and ambitions from 2020 onward.<lb/> While security of electricity supply is not the driver of these global negotiations, negotiators from<lb/> IEA member countries should be aware that failure to reach agreement affects investment in<lb/> electricity markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, global certainty will not be achieved quickly or easily, and governments face the<lb/> challenge of ensuring that investment continues in the meantime. A stable, long‐term domestic<lb/> policy framework with wide political support helps provide investment certainty, although global<lb/> uncertainties will still cause investors to question the probability of these policies being modified<lb/> in the future. To provide this sort of certainty, the EU has already set targets for 2020 in its<lb/> emissions trading system, and intends to set 2030 targets in the next few years.<lb/></p>

			<p>The design of domestic climate policy instruments can build on lessons learned from policies<lb/> already implemented. Emissions trading schemes (ETS) are currently regarded as the most<lb/> politically feasible means of pricing greenhouse gas emissions, aiming at providing appropriate<lb/> incentives for investment in low‐carbon technologies and demand reduction. However, the<lb/> detailed design of these schemes matters, particularly setting the overall cap on emissions at a<lb/> level that requires emissions reductions from participants. Due to the financial crisis, the caps for<lb/> Phase II (2008‐2012) and Phase III (2013‐2020) are now understood to have been set too high.<lb/> Confronted with a carbon price too low to trigger low‐carbon investments, the European Union<lb/> considered setting‐aside EU Allowances and changing the 2020 CO 2 emissions target. On the one<lb/> hand, such actions would be consistent with the decarbonisation objective and one could argue<lb/> that this signals the commitment of Europe to maintaining binding climate policy. But on the<lb/> other hand, this needs to be done in a way that maintains trust in the scheme&apos;s settings and seeks<lb/> to minimise perceptions of political risk; otherwise, it could undermine the long‐term credibility of<lb/> the trading scheme.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 31 • Illustration of the carbon price support mechanism<lb/> Source: HM Treasury, 2010.<lb/>Page | 64<lb/></figure>

			<p>Alternative design features to improve investment certainty include carbon price floors, as long as<lb/> these are credible (IEA, 2008a), or even specifying separate emissions targets (and associated<lb/> policy measures) for the electricity sector. In general, economic efficiency and the cost of climate<lb/> policy is minimised by wide sectoral coverage. However, setting a separate emissions target for<lb/> the electricity sector could give a clearer signal to electricity investors, particularly if this is seen as<lb/> a more sustainable policy. There will be a trade‐off between overall economic efficiency and<lb/> investment certainty that will need to be assessed. This takes time, but can restore confidence<lb/> concerning the commitment of the global community to mitigate climate change despite the<lb/> economic turmoil.<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy Efficiency Policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Reducing energy demand through cost‐effective efficiency gains can be a key element of both<lb/> managing energy demand growth and implementing low‐carbon strategies. However, these gains<lb/> are not always easy to deliver in practice, and they must be continuously monitored and verified.<lb/> Some energy efficiency programmes in the Pacific Northwest, California and New England (such as<lb/> the California initiative) have been very successful in reducing or eliminating the need for new<lb/> supply‐side resources, consistently delivering on targets. However, in other instances<lb/> governments have announced ambitious energy efficiency goals but not backed these up with<lb/> credible policies, institutions, and tracking systems, leading to disappointment. Fortunately, a<lb/> significant evidence base now exists on &quot;what works&quot; in terms of energy efficiency policy design<lb/> and implementation. This is highlighted in the IEA&apos;s 25 Energy Efficiency Recommendations, and<lb/> the &quot;Policy Pathways&quot; series of publications which provide guidance on implementation. 16<lb/></p>

			<head>Technology policies<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the past 20 years, several layers of energy policies have been added to facilitate deployment<lb/> of renewable technologies, improve energy efficiency or develop nuclear energy. These policies<lb/> now determine an increasing portion of investment in the electricity sector.<lb/></p>

			<p>As pointed out in Summing up the Parts, &quot; the package of energy policies must be regularly<lb/> reviewed and updated to maintain calibration over time &quot; IEA (2011b). However, once introduced,<lb/> project developers become used to them and these policies tend to be difficult to reform, which<lb/> can lead to significant inconsistencies between them.<lb/></p>

			<p>These risks can be minimised by getting policies right at the outset. Reforming policies can help<lb/> staying in the comfort zone. Furthermore, well‐designed technology policies must prevent<lb/> possible side‐effects on the electricity market functioning. This includes:<lb/></p>

			<p> Defining credible policy targets taking into account the maturity of different technologies and<lb/> uncertainty on learning rates, with sensible objectives and milestones for renewables and<lb/> energy efficiency;<lb/>  Provide a predictable and transparent renewable energy policy framework, integrating RE<lb/> policy into an overall energy strategy, taking a portfolio approach by focusing on technologies<lb/> 16<lb/></p>

			<p>One particular area that shows significant promise both for delivering efficiency gains cost‐effectively, and<lb/> also delivering them with certainty, is to place obligations for energy efficiency delivery with electricity<lb/> providers such as utilities or retail companies. If these programmes are well designed, they can deliver<lb/> consistent year‐on‐year savings, reducing the need for new supply in a predictable manner. The IEA&apos;s work<lb/> stream entitled Policies for Energy Provider Delivered Energy Efficiency (PEPDEE) is working to coalesce and<lb/> disseminate proven practices in regulation and programme delivery through regional PEPDEE workshop reports<lb/> and PEPDEE case studies.<lb/> Page | 65<lb/> that will best meet policy needs in the short and long term, and backing the policy package<lb/> with ambitious and credible targets.<lb/>  Taking a dynamic approach to policy implementation, differentiating according to the current<lb/> maturity of each individual renewable energy technology, while closely monitoring national<lb/> and global market trends and adjusting policies accordingly;<lb/>  Choosing a time schedule of renewable deployment, reflecting these cost reductions but also<lb/> taking into account needs to replace ageing capacity and demand growth; and<lb/>  Avoiding unexpected reversals of the overall energy strategy.<lb/> There is a trade‐off between ensuring long‐term stability of existing policies and adjusting them to<lb/> changing economic, international and technological conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>When regulatory changes occur, it should be done in a planned and well communicated way. The<lb/> example of the United Kingdom shows that reforming low‐carbon support instruments can take<lb/> time. The proposed electricity market reform, which goes through several reforms in parallel,<lb/> mobilizes a lot of resources and staff.<lb/> However, in many countries, it must be acknowledged that reducing the causes of energy policy<lb/> risk and regulatory opportunism will remain a challenge during the transition to a low‐carbon<lb/> economy. Governments should aim to provide more certainty and predictability, while evolutions<lb/> of climate policies may be needed to reflect a rapidly changing new economic environment and<lb/> rapidly declining costs of some low‐carbon generation technologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Design of renewable support instruments<lb/> Findings<lb/></head>

			<p>The first support policies for renewable energy were introduced without considering their<lb/> possible impact on the functioning of electricity markets (IEA, 2011b). In the early stage this was<lb/> not an issue, as the share of variable renewable energy was initially very low. But as these policies<lb/> become effective, variable renewables now represent 20% to 30% of the electricity generated in<lb/> some countries and they grow much more rapidly than electricity consumption. Support<lb/> instruments and market frameworks must be designed to be mutually compatible with each other<lb/> during the transition period toward market‐based low‐carbon investments; several simple<lb/> measures would significantly reduce the risks faced by market‐driven investments, without<lb/> necessarily altering the effectiveness of renewable policies.<lb/> These include the following:<lb/>  Using predictable instruments to achieve the policy targets, and<lb/>  Accurate forecasts of low carbon deployment are essential to be able to evaluate the size of both<lb/> the market for low‐carbon generation and the residual market. Support instruments for low‐<lb/> carbon generation which include some control over quantitative deployment of capacity provide<lb/> more predictability.<lb/>  Efficient participation of renewables in the markets requires adaptation of some renewable<lb/> support instruments. While instruments such as feed‐in tariffs are effective during the inception<lb/> phase, the benefits of market participation increase for high shares of variable renewable<lb/> resources. For an efficient participation, renewables would have to provide a dollar‐per‐MWh bid,<lb/> below which they are no longer willing to generate.<lb/> Page | 66<lb/>  For high shares of variable renewable energy sources, avoiding incentives to renewable<lb/> generators that hinder the system integration of renewables, such as fully decoupling<lb/> remuneration from market price signals. For instance, decoupling subsidies from generated<lb/> electricity would create the conditions to move toward participation of renewables on the day‐<lb/> ahead and balancing energy market.<lb/></p>

			<head>Predictability of support instruments for renewables<lb/></head>

			<p>Accurate forecasts of renewable deployment are essential to be able to evaluate the size of the<lb/> residual electricity market for non‐renewable generation. Even though the load factor may be<lb/> decreasing over time, investors can anticipate this effect and they can choose the lower cost<lb/> option to serve this declining market.<lb/> Nevertheless, the pace of renewable deployment introduces uncertainty over the load factor for<lb/> conventional power plants (cf. Chapter 4). For instance, feed‐in‐tariffs for solar PV and wind in<lb/> Europe led to an unanticipated increase in installed capacity in 2010 and 2011.<lb/></p>

			<p>More predictable renewable policies would reduce the load factor risk. In practice, this means<lb/> preventing the &quot; stop and go &quot; of renewable policies and controlling costs. Auctions or quantity‐<lb/> based approaches to subsidies can better control the quantity of new capacity (<ref type="biblio">Cramton and<lb/> Ockenfels, 2011</ref>). Such adaptations would greatly contribute to mitigating policy risk for owners of<lb/> conventional power plants and also for the renewable industry itself.<lb/></p>

			<head>Adapting renewable support instruments to ensure efficient participation in the<lb/> energy, balancing and ancillary services markets<lb/></head>

			<p>Wholesale electricity markets are based on marginal cost pricing in order to attain the least cost<lb/> dispatch of installed capacity. Most of the hours, variable renewables with a zero marginal cost<lb/> will be dispatched efficiently. But in case of very high renewable generation and low demand (see<lb/> section above on minimum load balancing), renewable output may have to be curtailed to<lb/> balance supply and demand or for reasons of system security (even if this increases the full<lb/> lifecycle cost of renewable production).<lb/> Wholesale markets are efficient if generators bid their marginal costs on markets, but this may<lb/> not be the case if some generators benefit from out‐of market revenues such as priority dispatch<lb/> and feed‐in tariffs or tradable green certificate revenues. In particular, if TSOs sell renewable<lb/> electricity into the spot market at high, negative prices to guarantee the dispatch of variable<lb/> renewables, inefficient outcomes can occur – as has been the case in Germany, in particular in<lb/></p>

				<formula>late 2009.<lb/></formula>

			<p>Instruments such as feed‐in tariffs provide incentives to locate wind and solar capacity in good<lb/> resource locations and to ensure that they are actually generating. This is effective during the<lb/> inception and scale‐up phase (IEA, 2011a) at relatively moderate shares of variable renewables.<lb/> However, as these technologies reach maturity and their installed capacity increases, so do the<lb/> benefits of market participation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to restore efficient market signals, the participation of variable renewables in the energy<lb/> and reserve markets has to be ensured. Exposing renewable generators to market price signals,<lb/> providing incentives to generate according to the value associated with this generation. In<lb/> practice, this means that renewable generators would have to provide a dollar per MWh bid,<lb/> below which they are no longer willing to generate.<lb/></p>

			<p>In that perspective, renewable support instruments might need to be adapted in order to change<lb/> the marginal remuneration scheme when the system is in a state of</p>

			<table>excess supply. Germany and<lb/> Page | 67<lb/> the United Kingdom are already considering adaptations of their support mechanisms. Germany<lb/> recently introduced a market premium payment (see Box 4) and the United Kingdom is<lb/> considering the introduction of Contracts for Difference for off‐shore wind farms.<lb/></table>

			<p>Designing renewable support instruments compatible with the market participation is an<lb/> emerging topic. However, as the penetration of variable renewables in the system grows, they will<lb/> need to become normal actors in the overall energy markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 4 • Market premium payments in Germany<lb/> Allowing renewables to participate to the provision of balancing services<lb/></head>

			<p>Variable renewables generation is volatile and its output is less predictable than conventional<lb/> power plants, requiring ramping‐up and down to compensate for variations and imbalances of<lb/> variable generation.<lb/></p>

			<p>There is a growing debate concerning the economic interest to expose variable renewables to the<lb/> balancing markets. One the one hand, exposing wind energy sellers to a balancing mechanism<lb/> would reflect the costs and value associated with wind volatility and unpredictability.<lb/></p>

			<p>In situations of imbalance, wind or solar generators can provide flexible services by themselves.<lb/> For instance, a wind plant can operate at a fixed level below its available maximum output to<lb/> enable a spinning reserve to be available and &quot; up ramp &quot; service to be provided. The extent to<lb/> which this will take place will depend on the relative economic merits compared to other options.<lb/> Provided that balancing markets are well designed and in countries where they are integrated<lb/> with the energy market, it is efficient to expose variable renewables to the energy and balancing<lb/> market.<lb/></p>

			<p>On the other hand, in some countries balancing mechanisms are not perceived as being efficient or<lb/> enough liquid (<ref type="biblio">Newberry, 2012</ref>). In these countries, exposing variable renewables to the balancing<lb/> The optional market premium model was introduced on 1 st January 2012 (Erneuerbare<lb/> Energien Gesetz ‐ EEG). It opened the opportunity for renewable energy generators under the<lb/> FIT scheme to opt for selling electricity directly into the market. This has been applied in<lb/> particular for wind farms. Under the market premium model, a wind farm sells its produced<lb/> output to a third party at the market price rather than selling it to the grid operator at the<lb/> regulated feed‐in‐tariff.<lb/></p>

			<p>The reference market price for the calculation of the market premium is determined as the<lb/> monthly technology‐weighted spot price at the EPEX spot energy exchange. The premium is<lb/> then set as the difference in the average wind market price and the feed in tariff level. This<lb/> represents an implicit floor price guarantee for the wind farm at the level of the regulated<lb/> tariff. All wind generators that achieve a higher price on the market have an advantage; all<lb/> who make a below average revenue get less.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to the market price and the market premium, the wind farm is entitled to receive a<lb/> management premium, intended to cover the administrative costs associated with the direct<lb/> marketing of energy. The management premium is set at 12 EUR/MWh for 2012 and steps<lb/> down gradually to 7 EUR/MWh in 2015, where it was scheduled to will remain. However, a<lb/> reform of the premium is ongoing, as some stakeholders perceive it as being too high.<lb/></p>

			<p>More than 15 000 MW of renewable energy have been transferred to new renewable market<lb/> premium scheme in the first months of 2012.<lb/> Page | 68<lb/> risk could create inefficiencies, while the gains would be modest for small penetration of wind<lb/> power. Possible market design improvements are further investigated in the next section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Energy Market Design Improvements: a no‐regret solution<lb/></head>

			<p>Findings<lb/> Improvements of energy market design can be implemented easily and at minimal administrative<lb/> costs. Such incremental measures not only improve incentives to ensure generation adequacy,<lb/> but also handle operating challenges of integration of increasing share of variable renewables.<lb/> This includes:<lb/>  removing the causes of price restrictions that prevent electricity prices to rise high enough;<lb/>  defining and introducing new products (when and where necessary) (i.e. balancing, forward<lb/> energy product for extreme peak conditions….);<lb/>  considering the adoption of locational marginal pricing; and<lb/>  ensuring an efficient and integrated design of energy, balancing and reserve markets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Remove restriction on electricity prices<lb/></head>

			<p>In principle, well functioning and non‐distorted electricity prices should ensure prices high enough<lb/> to cover the fixed costs of peaking units during tight supply conditions when reserve margins are<lb/> too low. <ref type="figure">Figure 32</ref> (below) shows the highest electricity prices in PJM. Even though they can<lb/> exceed 700 USD/MWh during a limited number of hours, these prices may remain too low.<lb/> Departing from this textbook market design is likely to lead to adequacy problems. The<lb/> straightforward way to address the missing money problem is to remove economic price caps<lb/> below the value of lost load and limit out‐of‐market operations.<lb/> <lb/> Removing undue restrictions on peak prices will be important to ensure well‐functioning<lb/> electricity markets. Wholesale peak prices are not intrinsically bad, since in periods of scarcity,<lb/> high prices act to incentivise demand response and peak investments. However, monitoring that<lb/> peak prices are not excessive in periods of relative scarcity will remain a challenge for<lb/> regulators.<lb/> <lb/> Creating an efficient and transparent market platform for flexible services would allow all<lb/> technologies to compete equally. Defining new flexibility products such as ramping up and<lb/> down, fast response ramping, minimum load balancing, etc. would reveal a price for each<lb/> flexibility service. All technologies should be able to participate in these markets, including<lb/> variable renewable and conventional generation, demand response and storage. On this basis,<lb/> forward markets for such services could provide longer‐term signals to invest in the right<lb/> technologies.<lb/> <lb/> Variable renewable resources will have to contribute to the balancing of the system during<lb/> minimum load conditions. Above a certain level, the renewable output must be controlled<lb/> during periods of oversupply in order to ensure secure and reliable system operations. This<lb/> means that, in practice, some wind turbines or solar power plants must either operate below<lb/> their maximum output, as is already the case in Spain, Texas and Ireland.<lb/> <lb/> The locational marginal pricing (LMP) framework could bring increasing benefits as higher<lb/> shares of renewables have to be accommodated. LMP provides an efficient framework to attain<lb/> the least cost dispatch and curtailment decisions in order to reflect the impact of thousands of<lb/> renewable generators on losses and congestion on the network.<lb/></p>

			<head>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 69<lb/></head>

			<p>The causes of restrictions on electricity prices were discussed in chapter 4. One major question is<lb/> whether governments and system operators can address these causes.<lb/> Explicit price caps below the value of lost load could technically be removed and replaced by<lb/> other market power mitigation measures. Indeed, price caps have been introduced in some<lb/> markets (PJM) to address market power issues during scarcity conditions. As these price caps<lb/> have been used as justification for the introduction of complex and costly capacity markets, one<lb/> could legitimately ask whether price caps are the best instrument to mitigate market power. This<lb/> is all the more the case as market power on capacity markets also has to be monitored, meaning<lb/> that price caps only mitigate but do not solve the problem. Other mitigation measures are<lb/> available, including market monitoring during extreme peak prices, structural decisions to<lb/> increase competition where there is local market power, entering into long-term contracts with<lb/> generators facing a local market power or simply expanding the transmission network to increase<lb/> competition.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact on price resulting from the behaviour of system operators could also be addressed. One<lb/> possibility is to prevent out-of-market operations that restrict prices from increasing high enough<lb/> during scarcity hours. This might be difficult to implement in practice because as system operators<lb/> would be considered liable for not taking action in case of blackout, they usually prefer the certainty<lb/> associated with bilateral contracts. Another (more realistic) possibility would then consist of setting<lb/> the electricity price to the value of the lost load each time the system operator relies on out-of-<lb/>market operations, such as voltage reduction, to maintain reserve margin in real time.<lb/></p>

			<p>A trickier problem is the risk of political intervention when prices are peaking. In some countries,<lb/> high prices raise political acceptability issues and, based on experience, generators may anticipate<lb/> that governments will intervene. In other sectors, nobody hears or cares about the price of<lb/> intermediate goods being very high, as these prices have a negligible impact on their average cost.<lb/> Financial markets such as call options can help manage exposure of markets players to this<lb/> volatility. But sometimes peak power prices do make the headlines and public opinion is sensitive<lb/> to such events. Even in the absence of explicit price caps, just the threat of government<lb/> intervention may have the effect of discouraging investment. Unless governments are credible in<lb/> their commitment not to restrict prices, this can lead to expected missing money. And, as<lb/> discussed later, this issue becomes even more challenging as the share of variable renewables<lb/> increases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Electricity product definition<lb/></head>

			<p>While a megawatt‐hour of electricity is often considered as a commodity, this does not capture<lb/> the essential features of the product. Actually, electricity is an extremely differentiated product.<lb/> Electricity available in hour h and location i is not substitutable with electricity in hour h&apos; and<lb/> location i&apos; and should therefore be considered as two distinct products and markets. Furthermore,<lb/> the sub‐hourly variations of power over several consecutive time intervals also matters.<lb/> Maintaining a supply and demand balance in real time requires satisfying both technical<lb/> constraints and the economic capability to increase or reduce generation or load at different time<lb/> horizons (i.e. instantaneously, within 15 minutes, one hour, several hours or days), at different<lb/> speeds (ramp rates).<lb/> As the features of electricity systems change with increasing shares of renewables, so should the<lb/> definition of electricity markets where substitutable products are traded. Introducing new<lb/> products or services or even changing the definition of existing ones may be required. Such<lb/> products would represent an opportunity to further develop ancillary services markets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Indeed, as electricity markets developed, a set of power markets was created to put together<lb/> similar electricity products and reflect the features of electricity systems. Forward and day‐ahead<lb/> energy markets, by far the largest one, intra‐day, balancing and reserve markets (primary and<lb/> secondary) followed. Some countries have distinct markets for technical constraints (voltage<lb/> control and congestion management) while others co‐optimise dispatching and balancing<lb/> services. Some countries have developed sophisticated locational marginal pricing of electricity<lb/> for thousands of different nodes of a network, while others try to have uniform electricity tariffs<lb/> over a large geographic area.<lb/></p>

			<head>Call options (reliability options)<lb/></head>

			<p>A reliability option (RO) is a call option that is both physical and financial. A generator that sells a<lb/> reliability option must pay the system operator the difference between the spot price and the<lb/> strike price whenever the spot price exceeds the strike price.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is physical, in that it is associated with a specific plant that will be penalised if it is not available<lb/> when the option is called (i.e. when the spot price exceeds the option&apos;s strike price). The RO is<lb/> called when the spot price exceeds the strike price. The strike price can be set at a price that is<lb/> slightly higher than the marginal cost of the most expensive unit on the system. (<ref type="biblio">Cramton and<lb/> Stoft, 2005</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>These options can smooth revenues of peak plants over time and could also be used to hedge<lb/> market players exposed to peak prices. Some proposals have been made to create options for<lb/> balancing resources (Pöyry, 2011b). Another possibility is that these options could be procured by<lb/> system operators. In that case the outcome is similar to capacity markets discussed later. In any<lb/> case, such option products require well‐functioning energy markets, in particular, that electricity<lb/> prices can be high enough during scarcity conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Definition of flexible products<lb/></head>

			<p>In some jurisdictions, there is no market platform for some specific products needed by the<lb/> system operator in the short run. This may be the case for products to solve network congestion<lb/> (counter trading), products to ramp‐up or ramp‐down capacity to follow demand and renewable<lb/> output variations, or products for voltage control during certain hours. Some countries such as<lb/> Spain are considering the creation of new short‐term, flexible products markets, using existing<lb/> electronic market platforms as the tertiary reserves market.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the absence of such markets, system operators tend to rely on bilateral contracts with specific<lb/> power plants that have the technical capability to supply the specific service. However, the<lb/> financial settlement of these operations often lacks transparency. Defining open market platforms<lb/> for new products would contribute to increasing the revenues of flexibility services. Such markets<lb/> should be opened to power plants or demand response. They can provide a price signal to decide<lb/> to mothball an old power plant, to invest in demand response capabilities or a new flexible plant.<lb/> One caveat must be mentioned here: as products are defined more precisely, market liquidity and<lb/> market power quickly become issues. Cutting the definition of flexibility products into too many<lb/> small slices could reduce too much liquidity. Therefore, the number of products may have to<lb/> remain limited. In addition, system operators are often the natural counterparty of such flexibility<lb/> products and are the only ones that can create a forward demand curve.<lb/></p>

			<head>Locational marginal pricing<lb/></head>

			<p>Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP), or nodal pricing, is the cutting edge market-design for<lb/> economists. Defined very generally, LMP consists of centrally-computed electricity hourly prices,<lb/> set node by node (there are several thousands in PJM) that reflect the marginal cost of producing<lb/> and consuming electricity at each node of the network. A considerable literature lauds the merits<lb/> of LMP currently being applied in the North West of the United States. This centralised approach<lb/> factors in generation costs, losses and network constraints, so as to yield to the optimal dispatch<lb/> of existing assets in a transparent way.<lb/></p>

			<p>Currently limited to the United States and New-Zealand, many economists in other OECD<lb/> countries advocate nodal pricing. In Europe, nodal pricing would reduce the generation cost by<lb/> 1.1% to 3.6% (<ref type="biblio">Neuhoff et al, 2011</ref>). PJM estimates the overall benefits of integrated operation of<lb/> their system are USD 2.2 billion (approximately EUR 1.8 billion) annually (Ott, 2010, quoted by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Neuhoff et al, 2011</ref>).<lb/> However, applying nodal pricing across multiple jurisdictions may be a complex and lengthy<lb/> process. For the time being, market coupling in Europe is a much simpler procedure. Similar zonal<lb/> pricing approach can also be found in Australia (NEM), in some U.S. RTOs and in Nordpool. It<lb/> captures some of the benefits of LMP with a simpler definition based on the observation that<lb/> most network congestion in Europe occurs mainly at the borders between different system<lb/> operators&apos; areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>Looking forward, increasing shares of variable renewables located far from consumption centres<lb/> may lead to new grid congestions and increase transmission losses, in particular if network<lb/> investments lag behind renewable energy deployment. With higher shares of renewables, nodal<lb/> pricing could bring more cost savings. Indeed, nodal pricing allows differentiating the value of<lb/> different wind farms according to their impact on network congestion of network losses. LMP can<lb/> also provide locational signals for investment in new renewable generation. In addition, in case of<lb/> excess supply, LMP would lead to curtail first wind turbines located in nodes at the origin of<lb/> congestion or higher network losses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Consistent and integrated day‐ahead, intra‐day, balancing and reserve<lb/> markets<lb/></head>

			<p>The juxtaposition of several electricity markets (forward, day‐ahead, intra‐day, balancing and<lb/> reserve markets) reflects the complexity of system operations and of the engineering procedures<lb/> to ensure the balance of generation and load in real time. This organization reflects practical<lb/> computational restrictions with electrical grid management systems in the 90s. But this also<lb/> induces some complexity for market participants having to decide to allocate and sell their output<lb/> on these markets. Well designed and coordinated markets are essential to achieving efficient<lb/> operations of the existing assets.<lb/></p>

			<head>Progress has been made in the United States and Australia</head>

			<p>to integrate balancing and energy<lb/> markets (Australia). This reduces complexity for market participants but usually require greater<lb/> centralization of system operations which could limit its geographical scope.<lb/> In European countries, balancing markets are separate from energy markets. They are also<lb/> asymmetric, penalizing market participants that increase system imbalances. Such asymmetries<lb/> introduce distortions between balancing prices and energy prices. In the perspective of increased<lb/> participation of renewables in the balancing markets, this would penalize renewable operators,<lb/> who are less able to accurately predict their output before real time (for a more detailed<lb/> description, see Newberry, 2012). With this kind of balancing market, market participants prefer<lb/> to have gate closure closer to real time in order to adjust their generation plans and reduce their<lb/> exposure to the imbalance risk. Moreover, regional integration of balancing markets and even<lb/> other reserve markets over wider geographical areas could yield efficiency gains.<lb/></p>

			<head>Standards and Procedures: a valuable contribution<lb/></head>

			<p>Finding<lb/> Technical standard and procedures will continue to play a role to ensure electricity security. Even<lb/> where operations and investment decisions are market‐based, governments and system<lb/> operators will continue to define, in one way or another, the reliability criteria, some dispatching<lb/> capabilities and requirements for new generation capacity and electrical appliances connected to<lb/> the grid.<lb/> Two items have implications for electricity security in the context of decarbonisation: the<lb/> definition of the reliability criteria and the technical standards for system resources.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reliability criteria<lb/></head>

			<p>Owing to the technical restrictions that constrain the possibility to price reliability according to the<lb/> willingness to pay of different categories of consumers, governments will continue to have a role to<lb/> play in setting the reliability standards. In theory, the criteria defined is the value of lost load (voll),<lb/> with values in the range of 10 000 to 25 000 USD/MWh, and determines the cost of the last unit that<lb/> must be built to meet peak demand. In practice, governments take a decision on the security of<lb/> supply, in terms of acceptable unserved energy, corresponding to a reliability of c. 99.95%.<lb/></p>

			<p> Governments also contribute to ensuring security of electricity supply by issuing standards and<lb/> bringing transparency to the market. This includes the definition of reliability standards; the<lb/> publication of adequacy projections or the definition of technical requirements, such as flexibility of<lb/> power plants, controllability of wind and solar power plants or controllability of electrical<lb/> appliances.<lb/></p>

			<head>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/></head>

			<p>Page | 75<lb/></p>

			<head>Adequacy forecasts<lb/></head>

			<p>Another important procedure at the disposal of governments is to periodically publish adequacy<lb/> forecasts, projecting the supply/demand balance and forecasted reserve margins during peak<lb/> hours. Legislation mandating such projections is already in place in most OECD member countries.<lb/> This simple tool brings transparency on market forecasts and also helps inform market‐based<lb/> investment decision making. Such adequacy forecasts remain subject to macroeconomic<lb/> uncertainty but are becoming even more important in the context of uncertainty over renewable<lb/> policies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Technical flexibility and controllability requirements<lb/></head>

			<p>Technical requirements can ensure that new‐build or existing plants are flexible enough. Usually,<lb/> these tend to be defined by the industry. For instance, in the EUR (European Utilities<lb/> Requirements), the nuclear industry and utilities defined specifications in terms of flexibility for<lb/> nuclear reactors (<ref type="biblio">Pouret, and Nuttall, 2009</ref>). But governments can also play a role in promoting<lb/> specifications that reinforce future system flexibility, in consultation with technical bodies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Renewable plants should be equipped with devices to control their output in real time. In<lb/> particular, decentralised solar PV plants should also technically be able to contribute to system<lb/> stability, e.g. via dynamic control of active and reactive power output. This is particularly<lb/> important for decentralized PV in order to maintain the voltage level in the local network. As<lb/> already the case in many jurisdictions, technical norms published under the responsibility of<lb/> governments could mandate this to all newly created facilities. This is a key requirement for the<lb/> secure integration of increasing shares of renewables.<lb/></p>

			<p>These technical specifications are contained in grid codes which define the parameters that a<lb/> facility connected to a public electric network has to meet to ensure safe, secure and proper<lb/> economic functioning of the electric system. The &quot; facility &quot; can be a generating plant, a consumer,<lb/> or another network. The grid code is specified by an authority responsible for the system integrity<lb/> and network operation. Its elaboration usually implicates network operators (distribution and/or<lb/> transmission operators), representative of users and, to an extent, varying between countries, the<lb/> regulating body.<lb/></p>

			<head>Targeted Reliability Contracts: a temporary fix<lb/> Findings<lb/></head>

			<p>The policy measures described in the previous sections constitute the basic policy package (improved<lb/> climate policies, better energy only markets and standard and procedures). If these policies were to be<lb/> implemented successfully, they would lay the foundation of well‐functioning, energy only markets.<lb/></p>

			<p> Targeted contracts period can help countries facing short‐term and transitory adequacy or<lb/> reliability issues.<lb/></p>

			<p> Such contracts are quick to implement and it is possible to stop to sign new contracts once the<lb/> policy and regulatory uncertainty have been reduced and market design improved.<lb/></p>

			<p> Targeted contracts ensure security of supply without jeopardizing the objective to achieve the<lb/> economic benefits of well‐functioning energy only markets in the longer run.<lb/>  However, expectations of such contracts might lead to strategic behaviour as companies withhold<lb/> investment and wait for their introduction, and experience in certain countries indicate that it<lb/> could be difficult to stop them.<lb/></p>

			<head>Page | 76<lb/></head>

			<p>However, some reforms may be difficult to implement successfully and may take time. This is the<lb/> case, for example, of stable renewable policies and of building credibility of governments to let<lb/> electricity prices rise high enough during periods of scarcity. In addition, even if implemented<lb/> successfully, they have only an indirect effect on incentives to maintain or build adequate capacity<lb/> to meet demand, and there is no absolute certainty that they will be effective in ensuring the<lb/> right level of security of electricity supply in all circumstances. Furthermore, they may not address<lb/> all the investment issues. In particular, variability and volatility of revenues for peak power plants,<lb/> the load factor risk and peak prices may remain a concern.<lb/></p>

			<p>The practical considerations also matter, and implementing the measures of the basic package<lb/> takes time--several years --a lead time not compatible with urgent security of supply concerns. In<lb/> this respect, IEA countries face different situations. Most states have already developed or<lb/> improved energy markets and will continue to do so. While some regions face urgent generation<lb/> adequacy constraints (the United Kingdom and Japan, for instance), most of other countries have<lb/> enough excess-capacity, as a result of sluggish demand growth. In the latter case, reforming<lb/> electricity market design is not seen as a pressing concern.<lb/></p>

			<p>Targeted reliability contracts consist in signing a (generally multi-annual) -contract with few<lb/> power plants or consumers, to maintain reserve margins or network stability and reliability. This<lb/> includes measures such as strategic reserves, contracts to relieve congestion or maintain voltage<lb/> stability in certain zones.<lb/></p>

			<p>Targeted reliability contracts are easy and quick to implement. This feature is a major advantage<lb/> in case of urgent concern over security of electricity supply. In addition, it is fairly easy to stop to<lb/> sign new contracts once the policy and regulatory uncertainty have been reduced and market<lb/> design improved. Thus, targeted contracts ensure security of supply without jeopardizing the<lb/> objective to achieve the economic benefits of well-functioning energy only markets in the longer<lb/> run.<lb/> Several sub-options can be distinguished, based on the nature of the service or asset contracted:<lb/> • A contract with existing assets to prevent mothballing and handle transmission constraints;<lb/> • A contract to trigger investments in new power plants; and<lb/> • Contracts to develop demand response or other innovative solutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contract to prevent mothballing and handle transmission constraints<lb/></head>

			<p>System operators often enter into bilateral contracts with specific power plants to solve network<lb/> constraints or maintain network reliability. The advantages of such targeted contracts are their<lb/> rapidity and simplicity, and that they can be transitory. In markets without locational signals but<lb/> facing recurrent congestion or a voltage stability problem, system operators usually force the<lb/> operation of plants, even when their cost is higher. In general, such actions are necessary with<lb/> older plants that are less efficient.<lb/></p>

			<p>A similar contracting approach to keep ageing plants from being mothballed has recently been<lb/> used in several European countries:<lb/> • In 2003, authorities in Sweden and Finland asked their TSOs to procure &quot; strategic reserves &quot; , to<lb/> be activated in times of scarcity. This measure was motivated mainly to meet the need for<lb/> peak capacity during periods of drought, when the capacity of hydro would be reduced by<lb/> 40-50% and by the perceived failure of the energy-only market to deliver enough capacity.<lb/> • In 2012, the regulator in Germany approved a contract to maintain gas capacity in southern<lb/> Germany after the shutdown of 8 GW of nuclear power plants.<lb/> • In Denmark and Spain, the TSOs have contracted with thermal power plants needed to<lb/> maintain voltage stability during periods of low load and high renewable generation.<lb/></p>

			<table>2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/> Page | 77<lb/> In the United States, a federal regulation entitles system operators to sign so called Reliability<lb/> must-run contracts (RMR) with units required to meet reliability criteria in constrained areas.<lb/> These multi-year contracts are based on cost-of service agreement and have been used to<lb/> maintain existing capacity on line in all US zones, including liberalised markets such as PJM and<lb/> New England.<lb/></table>

			<p>In markets where a locational marginal pricing framework is applied, bilateral contracts can also<lb/> be signed to mitigate the locational market power issues when only one or two power plants can<lb/> relieve congestion or supply reactive power. However, to handle a network constraint, there may<lb/> be a lack of competition to provide these as only a few power plants are typically located in the<lb/> right place. Regulators should therefore keep in mind that targeted contracting can be subject to<lb/> lobbying or gaming. Generators may threaten to mothball a plant in order to extract some<lb/> additional revenues and increase the profitability of their assets. As regulators and system<lb/> operators tend to adopt a conservative approach towards electricity security, they prefer to keep<lb/> power plants online to avoid being blamed in case of capacity shortage or a network problem.<lb/> Maintaining effective System Operators incentives and transparency remains therefore important<lb/> in this context.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main drawback of targeted mechanisms is that they introduce market distortions. In<lb/> particular, if the strategic reserve is bidding too low prices on the power market, this can result in<lb/></p>

			<table>depressing prices and discouraging investments in new peaking plants. In addition, as pointed out<lb/> by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC 2011, p. 36), &quot; …strategic reserve runs<lb/> the risk of plants not selected choosing to close down if they do not receive a Strategic Reserve<lb/> contract. If this happens this could lead to the &apos;slippery slope&apos; effect, whereby more and more<lb/> plants must form part of the Reserve to ensure it remains effective. &quot;<lb/> Box 6 • The strategic reserve in Sweden and Finland<lb/> Sweden and Finland depend on hydro availability and after significant shortage in 2002/2003, the<lb/> authorities decided that their TSOs should procure a peak load reserve that is activated in times of scarcity.<lb/> Under the Act (2003:436) on peak load reserve, the Swedish TSO Svenska Kraftnät has the responsibility to<lb/> ensure that up to 2 000 MW is available during the winter period (compared to an historic peak load of 27<lb/> 000 MW). An Ordinance states the amount to be procured every winter (1750 MW for the period 16<lb/> March 2011 to 15 March 2013. Plants need to be able to be activated within 12 hours in Finland and 16<lb/> hours in Sweden. The Finnish TSO Fingrid procures up to 600 MW (compared to an historic peak load of 15<lb/> 000 MW).<lb/> In Finland, Fingrid organised auctions to contract short lead time, indicating that the intention of the<lb/> mechanism is to prevent existing plants from mothballing or decommissioning. Finland has old heavy oil<lb/> and coal plants. In 2009 and 2010, provision costs amounted to 22 500 EUR/MW/yr and 2 500<lb/> EUR/MW/yr, respectively. Four plants participated in the May 2011 auction and three were selected.<lb/></table>

			<p>In Sweden, the peak load reserve is procured annually and is composed of generation capacity and<lb/> demand reduction capacity. The share of demand reduction capacity will increase from 25% in 2012 to<lb/> 100% for the period 2017-2020. By 2020, the peak load reserve is to be completely phased out.<lb/> In Sweden, reserves can be activated on Nord Pool Elspot, if there is not enough capacity to clear the<lb/> market, at a price equals to the last commercial bid plus 0.1 EUR/MWh (with a maximum price of</p>

			<table>2 000<lb/> EUR/MWh). However this rarely happens (On December 17, 2009, the Swedish and Finnish peak load<lb/> reserves were activated on Elspot). Usually, Svenska Kraftnät activates the strategic reserve after the<lb/> closing of Elspot. In that case, the minimum price is specified in the contract. Svenska Kraftnät activated<lb/> the reserves during 30 days during winter 2009/2010, and during 8 days during winter 2010/2011.<lb/> Source: Svenska Kraftnät Frontier Economics (2011).<lb/></table>

			<head>Contracts to bring in new investment in power plants<lb/></head>

			<p>Another possibility to ensure generation adequacy consists in organising tenders to build new<lb/> power plants. This is a straightforward, quick and effective means to bring in new capacity when<lb/> supply adequacy forecasts show a lack of capacity a few years in advance and if old plants have to<lb/> be closed.<lb/> In France in 2000, the legislature passed a measure which would permit organisation of a call for<lb/> tenders to ensure adequate capacity or network constraints. This mechanism has been used to<lb/> build a CCGT power plant in France in Brittany. Likewise, in Norway, the network operator also<lb/> built and owns a gas‐fired power plant to feed oil rigs in case of a dry year.<lb/> This approach clearly substitutes for the market. With strategic reserves, the government or the<lb/> system operator, not the market participants, decides the type of capacity and chooses the<lb/> technology and the timing of investments. There is a room for competition, but it is limited to the<lb/> selection of the least cost provider of the capacity considered necessary.<lb/></p>

			<head>Contracts to develop demand response<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to correct the market failure associated with inelastic electricity demand, governments<lb/> may wish to promote demand response. Large industrial customers are already able to reduce<lb/> load. This potential can be increased but may remain limited. Moreover, demand response has to<lb/> compete with peaking plants whose annual fixed cost is low, in c. 100 USD/kW/year and the<lb/> availability of demand response potential is not guaranteed, unlike conventional generation. The<lb/> economic case for large‐scale deployment of demand response capability still must be made. This<lb/> is the case in particular for small consumers for which savings on their electricity bill may be very<lb/> low.<lb/></p>

			<p>Targeted contracting can accelerate the deployment of demand response and reinforce the<lb/> business model of smart grids. However, a centralised definition of the specifications of the<lb/> service may be a barrier to the development of other innovative demand‐side solutions. As these<lb/> demand side solutions reach a sufficient degree of maturity and as the automation and remote<lb/> control of electrical appliances develops, they will become competitive with other sources of<lb/> capacity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Market‐wide capacity mechanism: a safety net<lb/></head>

			<p>Findings<lb/></p>

			<p> Capacity markets can be effective to ensure adequate capacity and they can be used to promote<lb/> flexibility, investment in capacity and, in particular, demand response.<lb/>  Capacity markets have the advantage to encourage competition between different technologies<lb/> on a level playing field.<lb/>  However, capacity markets tend to have high transaction costs and put a burden on regulatory<lb/> institutions.<lb/></p>

			<p> They might have unintended consequences in creating secondary incentives and, depending on<lb/> their design, may create excess capacity and lower demand response during scarcity conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p> National capacity markets have a potential to introduce distortions between different countries or<lb/> jurisdictions of a single electricity market. Before introducing capacity mechanisms, governments<lb/> should consider their impact on incentives and define common rules on a market‐wide basis.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Page | 79<lb/></figure>

			<p>Unlike targeted reliability contracting, capacity markets should be viewed as a likely permanent<lb/> instrument. They are quite heavy‐handed administrative interventions which may ultimately lead<lb/> to re‐regulating many parameters of electricity markets. Their introduction can be motivated by a<lb/> lack of trust in energy‐only markets or poorly designed electricity markets. However, capacity<lb/> markets involve very technical discussions, still ongoing, about the incentives and their expected<lb/> effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our analysis suggests three reasons why governments may lose faith in the ability of energy‐only<lb/> markets to acquire enough investment to ensure security of electricity supply.<lb/> 1. Price restrictions or regulatory opportunism: governments anticipate that they will not let<lb/> electricity prices go high enough during periods of scarcity.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. Climate and technology policy risk: governments give priority to climate and renewable<lb/> policies which are not well‐integrated with well functioning electricity markets. They may<lb/> continue to define ambitious policy targets but lack certainty and to use renewable policies to<lb/> pursue multiple objectives.<lb/></p>

			<p>3. Revenue variability and volatility: given the current financial context, increasing yearly<lb/> variability of revenues negatively impacts the availability and the cost of</p>

			<table>capital. This reflects<lb/> concerns about liquidity of financial markets to hedge such risks and little appetite of financial<lb/> counterparties for it. This is a particular concern as peaking units are increasingly needed with<lb/> the development of renewables.<lb/> A market‐wide capacity mechanism can be broadly defined as a regulatory instrument designed to<lb/> create revenues for all capacity − generation or demand response − available during a specified<lb/> period, generally when system operations are tight. These capacity mechanisms complement<lb/> revenues from</table>

			<p>the sale of electricity, in order to assure that enough capacity is available to meet<lb/> peak demand in restructured electricity systems. This is especially the case for fixed cost recovery<lb/> of peak capacity rarely used and facing unduly capped prices.<lb/></p>

			<p>As market‐wide arrangements remunerate all capacity, this prevents negative bias that could<lb/> appear with targeted mechanisms. No technology is favoured by the mechanism; this leads, in<lb/> theory, to an efficient – least cost – portfolio of technologies.<lb/></p>

			<p>There are several classes of capacity mechanisms: regulators can choose to set prices (capacity<lb/> payments) or quantities (capacity markets), the time‐horizon can be annual or several years in<lb/> advance (forward capacity markets), capacity‐obligations can be assigned on suppliers<lb/> (decentralised capacity mechanism) or system operators can organise tenders (centralized<lb/> capacity mechanism). This section briefly describes the main dimensions of market‐wide capacity<lb/> mechanisms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Capacity payments 17<lb/></head>

			<p>In price‐based capacity mechanisms, a central institution sets the price for capacity. Such capacity<lb/> payments are supposed to compensate for the shortfall of revenues for all the capacity resulting<lb/> from price restrictions. The capacity payment is supposed to determine the capacity provided,<lb/> which is an outcome of the market.<lb/> Take a simple example. Assuming for simplicity that prices never exceed the short‐run, marginal<lb/> cost of peaking units, these plants never cover their fixed costs. The missing money is equal to the<lb/> capital cost annuity for an efficient peaking unit, usually in the range of<lb/> 50‐100 000 USD/MW/year. These payments should be made for all capacity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Page | 80<lb/></head>

			<p>The payments used in Spain are one example of such capacity payments (see Box 7).<lb/> It has been argued that in practice, capacity payments can be motivated in order to increase<lb/> profitability of power plants and compensate generators for the reduction of load factors<lb/> resulting from rapid deployment of renewables. However, it is important to keep in mind that the<lb/> objective of such mechanisms is not to increase the profitability of existing assets hit by the<lb/> economic crisis, but rather to provide certainty that there will be enough capacity available.<lb/></p>

			<head>Box 7 • Capacity payments in Spain<lb/> Capacity markets<lb/></head>

			<p>A capacity market is a market designed by policy makers and regulators to meet capacity needs as<lb/> defined by regulators. Unlike energy-only markets, it is a central body that defines which level of<lb/> capacity is adequate and explicitly sets the quantity for reserve margin or capacity obligation. This<lb/> constitutes a higher degree of regulatory intervention. The price determination and the choice of<lb/> the type of capacity (demand response, old power plants or new investments) are left to the<lb/> market.<lb/> So-called Reliability Options are similar to financial call-options to buy power at a predefined<lb/> strike price when the spot market price is above the strike price (<ref type="biblio">Cramton and Ockenfels, 2011</ref>).<lb/> Such options hedge consumers and generators. With these options, system operators play a<lb/> Spain has had a capacity charge system since market liberalisation in 1996. The original price for<lb/> capacity of 7.8 EUR/MWh was chosen as part of the stranded cost compensation that the<lb/> government guaranteed to generators, which has decreased progressively to 4.8 EUR/MWh between<lb/> the years 2000 and 2007.<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2007, after investment increased rapidly, the government introduced a new capacity charge. It<lb/> acts as a &quot; long-term investment incentive &quot; consisting of a payment for ten years, restricted to new<lb/> plants with a capacity above 50 MW (existing plants are eligible in case of significant refurbishment<lb/> investment).<lb/></p>

			<p>The incentive payment is computed as a function of the reserve margin when the plant starts<lb/> operations. The charge is capped to 28 000 EUR/MW/yr for a reserve margin index of 1.1 and<lb/> declines to 0 EUR/MW/yr for a reserve margin index equal to 1.29.<lb/> Source: Frontier Economics (2011).<lb/></p>

			<p>Our understanding is that these reliability options are similar to capacity markets except that they<lb/> are financial and physical. They have been presented above as a financial product derived from<lb/> energy-only markets on account of the fact that they must be based on well-functioning energy<lb/> markets during scarcity conditions.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> summarizes the different capacity markets according to two dimensions. Capacity<lb/> obligations can defined either for the short term or forward-looking, and the price determination<lb/> can be left either to decentralised trading or based on centralised auctions organised by the<lb/> system operator.<lb/></p>

			<head>Decentralised vs. centralised<lb/></head>

			<p>In decentralised capacity markets, such as the one discussed in France in 2011-2012, the system<lb/> operator defines the capacity obligation for each supplier as a percentage above the load they<lb/> expect to serve. These obligations can be either self supplied or bought on a market. The ISO<lb/> certifies capacity and certificates can be traded on a secondary market which determines a price.<lb/> Although capacity obligations are defined, adequacy still depends on the decentralised forecasts<lb/> of market size and market shares of each competing supplier.<lb/></p>

			<head>Short‐term vs. forward markets<lb/></head>

			<p>In short‐term markets, capacity targets are typically defined one year in advance. Like many other<lb/> markets in other sectors, short‐term price signals can work, provided that there is enough<lb/> certainty concerning the sustainability of the arrangement. Indeed, in many other industries<lb/> (e.g. mining, car, chips manufacturers), long‐term investments are rarely financed on the basis of<lb/> long‐term product sales.<lb/></p>

			<p>In forward and centralised capacity markets, capacity targets are established from three to five<lb/> years in advance, to reflect the minimum lead time required for the construction and<lb/> development of a new peaking plant or deployment for energy efficiency projects. It has been<lb/> argued that this presents the advantage of allowing new entrants to bid, making the market more<lb/> contestable.<lb/></p>

			<head>Geographical scope of capacity markets<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity markets are interconnected and increasingly integrated in some regions. During periods<lb/> of scarcity in one country or market, interconnections play a key role in ensuring system<lb/> adequacy. Available capacity in a zone contributes to meeting peak demand in the other zone.<lb/></p>

			<p>Introducing a capacity mechanism in a jurisdiction representing only one zone of an electricity<lb/> market raises many questions. First, the contribution of other zones via the interconnection<lb/> capacity has to be quantified by the system operator when defining the capacity requirement for<lb/> the jurisdiction. Second, this contribution of interconnection can be remunerated or not, and if it<lb/> is remunerated, this can be done to the owner of the transmission rights or to the generating<lb/> capacity on the other side of the interconnection. Third, the implications of different mechanisms<lb/> on the effectiveness in terms of generation adequacy and possible gaming of the capacity markets<lb/> must be carefully analysed. For instance, a capacity market limited to one jurisdiction may lead to<lb/> overinvestment in generation capacity if the contribution of interconnection is underestimated by<lb/> conservative system operators.<lb/> Finally, the competitive effects must be carefully analysed. A single capacity market may<lb/> introduce a distortion of competition within a single market. In Europe, there are some concerns<lb/> that national capacity markets could attract investment in countries introducing them, distort<lb/> competition and create a new barrier for regional market integration. There are also concerns<lb/> about the treatment of interconnections and the lack of regional coordination regarding supply<lb/> adequacy.<lb/></p>

			<p>Where capacity markets are implemented, the treatment of interconnections will remain a key<lb/> issue. For regions well interconnected and with coupled electricity prices, the target model should<lb/> include a common definition of capacity credits and the possibility to exchange these credits with<lb/> a proper treatment of network constraints.<lb/></p>

			<head>Other dimensions<lb/></head>

			<p>Designing the details of capacity markets necessitates solving many other technical questions.<lb/>  Interaction with peak prices: a capacity market ensures that there is always more than enough<lb/> capacity and this tends to prevent episodes where market conditions are tight, thus reducing<lb/> peak prices. This may reduce incentives to save energy or engage demand response actions<lb/> during these hours, unless they can participate in the capacity market, which might not be<lb/> possible for small players because of transaction costs.<lb/>  Local capacity markets: some small zones of the grid remain poorly interconnected and<lb/> ensuring adequacy in these zones requires setting up local capacity markets. If a limited<lb/> number of competing generating units are sufficient to serve it, market power can be an issue.<lb/>  Complexity and governance: it is often mentioned that capacity markets tend to be complex<lb/> and costly. Indeed, the experience of PJM, where a new capacity market was introduced in<lb/> 1997 to fix several problems, shows that fine‐tuning capacity markets is a difficult and lengthy<lb/> process.<lb/></p>

			<p>Page | 84<lb/></p>

			<head>Flexible capacity markets<lb/></head>

			<p>It has been proposed that capacity markets can also play a role in ensuring that sufficient<lb/> flexibility services will be available to accommodate increasing shares of variable renewables.<lb/> Based on the experience of some existing capacity markets, there is a concern that the power<lb/> plants triggered by capacity markets may not flexible enough. This could lead to restrict the<lb/> dispatch of variable renewables in the future or require further investments to upgrade plants.<lb/> Indeed, adding flexibility features to the definition of capacity obligation can contribute to<lb/> ensuring that the ramp‐up or minimum load requirements will be met.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, restricting capacity markets to flexible products would not solve the generation<lb/> adequacy issue, as all the capacity would not be factored in. In practice, flexible capacity markets<lb/> would thus lead the regulator to define quantitative flexibility forward objectives in terms of<lb/> ramp‐up, ramp‐down or minimum load. This would go a step further than the definition of<lb/> flexibility products already discussed before and would constitute an additional market<lb/> intervention.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our study suggests that the opportunity of such flexible capacity markets needs further<lb/> examination for several reasons. Indeed, the ramp‐up capacity of conventional power plants is<lb/> not a major concern until 2020 in most countries. Gas‐fired power is the technology of choice for<lb/> new investments and the recent CCGTs are flexible. As a result, flexibility can be seen as a by‐<lb/> product of adequacy, since generation capacity that will be built primarily to ensure adequacy is<lb/> also flexible.<lb/></p>

			<p>Minimum load balancing may be a more important operating challenge, as this leads to curtail<lb/> renewable during hours of low load and high renewable generation. However, provided that<lb/> renewable generation is controllable, this is not an issue for the security of electricity supply.<lb/> While the value of lost load is extremely high in case of a generation adequacy problem (10 000 to<lb/> 20 000 USD/MWh), the cost of lost renewable generation remains low (50 to 200 USD/MWh).<lb/> This suggests that regulators could continue to be concerned with supply adequacy more than<lb/> with flexibility. As discussed previously, creating a market platform for flexibility could be<lb/> sufficient in order to bring together solutions such as flexibility from nuclear or coal plants,<lb/> pumped storage, demand‐side positive response (water heating) and curtailment of variable<lb/> generation, as well as other technical solutions in order to develop least cost flexibility solutions.<lb/> Page | 85<lb/></p>

			<head>Annex: Evaluating the policy options<lb/></head>

			<p>Policy makers in several member countries are considering new measures to address security of<lb/> electricity supply. There are many options and liberalisation is still a work in progress. Choosing<lb/> the most promising measures and prioritising regulatory efforts will be a key challenge during the<lb/> transition to a low‐carbon economy.<lb/></p>

			<p>The evaluation framework proposed here has been designed to help governments to select the<lb/> options that best fit their specific situations. While pure economic analysis would probably lead to<lb/> prescribing an ideal solution, the approach adopted here aims to reflect real life circumstances<lb/> and to identify situations under which one option might be preferable.<lb/></p>

			<p>The following criteria are proposed to help evaluate the range of measures:<lb/> 1. Proportionality: Does the scope and form of the regulatory intervention match what is<lb/> necessary to tackle the issue, given its social cost?<lb/> 2. Effectiveness: Will the implemented option be effective in ensuring adequate security of supply?<lb/> 3. Lead time: Is the duration necessary to set‐up a regulation compatible with the potential<lb/> electricity security of supply problem?<lb/> 4. Simplicity: Has the incremental evolution of existing tools been taken into consideration in<lb/> order to avoid unnecessarily complex market design?<lb/> 5. Direct costs: What information and authority would a regulator need in order to set the<lb/> capacity requirement and what would be the direct costs?<lb/> 6. Indirect costs: What are the potential unintended effects, market distortion and resulting<lb/> dynamic costs?<lb/> 7. Adaptability: Can the arrangement be easily harmonised with neighbouring markets in order<lb/> to prevent distortion of competition? Can it be easily abandoned when it no longer needed?<lb/></p>

			<p>The qualitative evaluation framework has been applied to assess the strength and weaknesses of<lb/> the different options. The results of this analysis are summarised in the figure below, followed by<lb/> a detailed description of each criterion and the analysis of the options.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 38 • Qualitative assessment of different policy options to ensure security of electricity supply<lb/> during the transition<lb/> A<lb/> Improved<lb/> climate and<lb/> low carbon<lb/> policies<lb/> B<lb/> Better<lb/> energy<lb/> markets<lb/> E<lb/> Market‐wide<lb/> capacity<lb/> mechanism<lb/> D<lb/> Targeted<lb/> contracting<lb/> C<lb/> Standard &amp;<lb/> procedures<lb/> Proportionate<lb/> Lead time<lb/> Effectiveness<lb/> Direct costs<lb/> Indirect costs<lb/> Poor<lb/> Simplicity<lb/> Adaptability<lb/> Weak<lb/> Average<lb/> Good<lb/> Excellent<lb/> Legend:<lb/> Page | 86<lb/></figure>

			<head>Proportionality<lb/></head>

			<p>The options available to ensure adequate capacity and security of electricity supply can lead<lb/> governments to reintroduce a significant degree of regulation of the generation market. A heavy‐<lb/> handed market intervention may undermine the liberalisation objective and the expected<lb/> benefits in terms of least cost dispatch, efficient operation and market‐based investments.<lb/> A proportional regulatory intervention is one whose scope and form does not exceed what is<lb/> necessary to address the issue that needs to be fixed and its social costs. A proportional market<lb/> design reform is one that neither under‐regulates nor over‐regulates. In general, the more social<lb/> costs are at stake, the more effective the measures imposed should be: electricity rationing is not<lb/> an option for IEA member countries&apos; governments. Striving for proportionality can help to ensure<lb/> that measures are appropriate for the issue, that they don&apos;t pursue distinct objectives and thus<lb/> are more predictable. This notion is used in competition law in some jurisdictions, such as the EU,<lb/> where competition statutes expressly require remedies to be proportionate to the infringement<lb/> committed (OECD, 2008).<lb/> Options A (improved climate and low‐carbon policies) and B (better energy only markets)<lb/> addresses the roots of the problem and thus can be considered as proportionate measures. The<lb/> analysis of option C (standards and procedure) is intermediate and depends on specific measures<lb/> under consideration. Options D and E are interventions that significantly affect the functioning of<lb/> energy markets. Indeed, even where there are price caps, the simple anticipation by market<lb/> players of political intervention to cap power prices is one of the key issues. Assuming this is<lb/> actually the case, incremental enhancement of energy‐only market design can reinforce the<lb/> credibility of governments or even didactic presentation for policy makers may be sufficient.<lb/> Instead, a market‐wide capacity mechanism may seem heavy‐handed and complex.<lb/></p>

			<head>Effectiveness<lb/></head>

			<p>Electricity systems involve a significant degree of complexity and enhancing one specific measure<lb/> does not necessarily produce the expected effect. Other events can occur and gaming effects can<lb/> lead to unanticipated consequences, which can, in turn, erode the confidence in market‐based<lb/> solutions to ensure sufficient and timely investments.<lb/></p>

			<p>An effective option to ensure generation adequacy has to guarantee enough certainty to have<lb/> timely and sufficient investments. It is necessary to assess to what extent the issue will be<lb/> reduced if the option is successfully implemented. Accordingly, policy makers may prefer quick<lb/> fixes to eliminate the symptoms rather than addressing the roots of the problems: If you don&apos;t<lb/> have enough capacity, just ask the system operator to add new capacity! This is simple to<lb/> understand, has visible effects and keeps the lights on.<lb/> Among the options available, this is exactly what targeted contracts do and also what capacity<lb/> markets do more indirectly, by defining directly reliability criteria not in terms of value of lost load<lb/> (voll) but in terms of capacity requirements. However, the effect of more market‐based options is<lb/> more indirect, difficult to monitor and can be affected by financing conditions. But in case of a<lb/> blackout, those responsible for system security will be blamed for having relied on dubious<lb/> solutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Lead time<lb/></head>

			<p>Designing and implementing proper policies takes time. The process involves asking experts to<lb/> write reports, organising consultations of stakeholders, drafting legislation and bringing the bill to<lb/></p>

			<head>© OECD/IEA 2012<lb/> Securing Power during the Transition<lb/></head>

			<p>Page | 87<lb/> vote. Once the bills are approved, the administration must draft decrees and administrative<lb/> orders. Overall, policy changes can be a slow process subject to shifts in governments and<lb/> changes in political priorities or negative arbitrage, all of which have the potential to ruin several<lb/> years of efforts.<lb/></p>

			<p>The lead time can be defined as the duration between the initial policy proposal and the date by<lb/> which it enters into force and begins to have effects. Moreover, even after it enters into force, it<lb/> may take a few years to build a track record showing that a new market design produces the right<lb/> signals and is sufficiently stable. For instance, a few years with peak prices not followed by<lb/> regulatory intervention could be necessary to build trust in an energy‐only market design.<lb/> This has two implications. First, when regulatory change occurs, it should be done well in advance<lb/> and in a planned and well communicated way. An example is the current energy policy developed<lb/> in the United Kingdom, which started in 2008 with a White Paper on nuclear and is expected to<lb/> come into force in 2013‐14 with the first Contracts for Difference (CfD). Second, when there is no<lb/> time left, governments may be obliged to choose more rapid, though less efficient options.<lb/></p>

			<p>The leads times for the various options presented above differ:<lb/></p>

			<p> Global climate policies (option A) will not be clarified until 2015 for an application after 2020,<lb/> at best.<lb/>  Regional climate and renewable policies (option A) take a few years to be defined and may not<lb/> produce effects before 2020. Moreover, changing an existing renewable support scheme may<lb/> be a complex and quite long process.<lb/>  Incremental change of energy‐only market design (option B) is a quicker option to implement −<lb/> a few months or years − but a track record may be necessary before they deliver adequate<lb/> capacity.<lb/>  Standards and norms (option C) can also be quickly introduced and applied.<lb/>  Targeted contracts (option D) is by far the most rapid option as contracts can always be signed<lb/> in a few months in order to ensure system security in a hurry.<lb/>  Introducing capacity mechanisms (option E) may take two or three years. Unlike the case of<lb/> market design evolutions, they produce effects as soon as they enter into force.<lb/> The slow pace of development of energy policies and the long time associated with energy<lb/> investment and decisions is a matter of uncertainty. Energy policies can change with<lb/> governments. New administrations can undo a law before it takes effect, or even after. Some<lb/> degree of uncertainty seems inevitable: while stable regulation is of key importance for successful<lb/> market functioning, governments cannot stick to unsuccessful or too costly regulatory reforms.<lb/></p>

			<head>Simplicity<lb/></head>

			<p>Several overlapping policies already influence the framework for electricity markets,<lb/> encompassing. not only liberalisation but also carbon policy, renewable policies and energy<lb/> efficiency policies. It appears that this increasingly complex market environment increases the<lb/> perceived policy risk. While originally designed to be complementary and consistent policies, each<lb/> one tends to become autonomous and live its own life. The typical approach has been to add new<lb/> regulations to fix issues resulting from other regulations. Uncertainty over the future pace of<lb/> these policies and continuous regulatory changes can push the attractiveness of the industry<lb/> down.<lb/></p>

			<p>Page | 88<lb/> A simple policy is a policy that is capable of avoiding unnecessarily complex policy or regulatory<lb/> intervention. It must be easy to understand, as far as possible use existing procedures and IT<lb/> tools; and should aim to replace old policies rather than adding a new layer of regulation.<lb/> Among the options considered here, forward capacity market (option E) is by far the most<lb/> complex, as it requires setting‐up an entirely new system. Climate policies (option A) also involve<lb/> a certain degree of complexity, as they usually rely on a set of policy instruments such as carbon<lb/> pricing, FiT, auctions for renewables, energy efficiency policies, and so on standards and<lb/> procedures (option C) and targeted measures (option D) are relatively simple to understand and<lb/> implement and can normally be abandoned easily. Improving energy‐only markets can also be<lb/> regarded as fairly simple, although the design details must be carefully defined.<lb/></p>

			<head>Direct cost<lb/></head>

			<p>Regulation is not free. Regulators need staff, information and consultancy to do their job. In<lb/> addition, corporations also bear costs and establishing new trading electronic platforms entails<lb/> expenditure. At first glance, these costs may appear relatively limited compared to the expected<lb/> benefits of new measures. However, public spending is coming under increasing pressure and<lb/> many member countries must streamline their administrative processes.<lb/> Given its complexity, creating capacity markets (option E) tends to be relatively more costly than<lb/> other options. Improving existing market design and standards and procedures (options A and C)<lb/> are incremental evolutions and their costs are easier to predict and lower.<lb/></p>

			<head>Indirect cost<lb/></head>

			<p>The costs of regulation must be viewed dynamically, taking into account the potential impact on<lb/> the adoption of new technologies and practices. Indeed, these dynamic effects often represent a<lb/> significant potential cost of regulations. Indirect dynamic costs can make market performance<lb/> even worse than if we simply lived with the market imperfections. (<ref type="biblio">Joskow, 2010)<lb/></ref> Avoiding indirect costs is about preventing rules or distortions that can create barriers to new<lb/> technology development. Solutions that create a level playing field, e.g. a comparable treatment<lb/> for all technologies, are more likely to limit indirect costs. Appropriately designed solutions should<lb/> focus on solving the causes of issues, such as policy risk or better designed markets. On the<lb/> contrary, options that pick up technologies such as targeted contracts, and in certain cases,<lb/> standards and norms, carry the risk of significant indirect costs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Adaptability<lb/></head>

			<p>By many aspects, liberalisation in still a work in progress in many countries, and integration of<lb/> renewables is expected to require future changes of market design. Market integration over large<lb/> geographical areas will bring benefits. It reduces dispatching and balancing costs and facilitates<lb/> the accommodation of increasing shares of variable renewables. As these developments are<lb/> foreseen, policy makers need to anticipate that further harmonisation will be required.<lb/></p>

			<p>The two fundamental principles which ensure the adaptability of a regulatory arrangement are:<lb/>  reversibility, in order to remove the new regulation if it is not needed anymore, and<lb/>  ability to be harmonised, so that the regulatory option can converge rapidly with other<lb/> systems.<lb/> Market‐wide capacity mechanisms tend to be less adaptable than targeted contracts. The<lb/> possibility to adapt other options would depend on design details.<lb/></p>
