            <figDesc>Commission issued a Communication on 21 October 2005 outlining a common methodology<lb/> to measure administrative costs in EU proposals.<lb/> More recently, the Commission Working Document on Administrative Costs, adopted on 14<lb/> November 2006, presents a broad strategy towards the reduction of administrative burdens,<lb/> using some results of the pilot project. This pilot identifies policy areas that are most responsible<lb/> for creating administrative burdens, by carrying out a cross-country comparison of the Member<lb/> States that have already done a baseline measurement.<lb/> An Action Programme, presented on 24 January 2007, demonstrates in concrete terms the way<lb/> in which the Commission intends to work with Member States to cut administrative burdens on<lb/> businesses by a quarter by 2012. The Programme focuses on information obligations in thirteen<lb/> selected priority areas including company law, employment relations, taxation/VAT, statistics,<lb/> agriculture and transport. The Action Programme also includes a first series of &apos;fast track actions&apos;<lb/> where significant benefits could be generated through relatively minor changes in the underlying<lb/> legislation. The measures could reduce the burdens on businesses by 1.3 billion euro.<lb/> 101<lb/> Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005 on relations between the EP and the Commission (paragraph 32).<lb/> 102<lb/> There exist two types of tariff – internal and external. The internal tariff is comprised of the unit costs per worker performing<lb/> the relevant activity within the business (hourly payroll costs + additional expenses) and the cost of materials. The external<lb/> tariff means, for instance, the hourly rate for the work of an external expert of organisation fulfilling the information<lb/> requirement on behalf of the relevant business. Time means the number of time units (hours) taken to carry out the required<lb/> activity. The required time may be determined by interviewing employers and employees.<lb/> 103</figDesc>

            <figDesc>In the Czech Republic, the government adopted an Action Plan of Reducing Administrative<lb/> Burden on Businesses in April 2005, as well as a Methodology of Measurement of Administrative<lb/> Burden, based on the Dutch Standard Cost Model. A baseline measurement of administrative<lb/> burden imposed on businesses was then conducted and completed by December 2005. The<lb/> results of the measurements undertaken by particular ministries and central state administration<lb/> authorities were summarised in the report Analysis of Administrative Burden on Businesses<lb/> published in 2006. The results were used to prepare the proposal for the next phase of the<lb/> process, which should be submitted for the government&apos;s approval in 2007. It is envisaged that<lb/> mandatory, ex ante administrative burden assessment will be introduced.<lb/> In 2006, the Ministry of Justice in Estonia published an action plan to simplify a large number of<lb/> areas that affect businesses. It includes:<lb/> •<lb/> Simplification of company law.<lb/> •<lb/> Proposals to improve the quality of notaries.<lb/> •<lb/> Reforms of labour law.<lb/> •<lb/> A proposal concerning cost-based fees.<lb/> •<lb/> Improvements in planning and construction laws.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Czech Republic, Poland and the Slovak Republic have launched pilot projects or have<lb/> undertaken surveys in order to measure administrative costs and assess how friendly the<lb/> business regulatory framework is. The quality of the work varies, in accordance with the<lb/> enthusiasm of the officials. In Cyprus, a number of surveys have been undertaken on the initiative of either the Public<lb/> Administration or Personnel Department of the Ministry of Finance, or the relevant department or<lb/> service, for the reduction of red tape. Cyprus is recognised as having an administrative structure<lb/> which is business friendly.<lb/> In Estonia, two pilot projects were being undertaken in 2006, with obvious interest, in the Ministry<lb/> of Economic Affairs and Communications in order to test the Dutch Standard Cost Model.<lb/> Several ministries and offices (e.g., Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of the<lb/> Environment, and the Statistical Office and the Tax and Customs Board) have been involved in<lb/> the leading group for testing the model.</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Nevertheless, a joint project was initiated by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice in<lb/> Hungary to assess the administrative burdens of VAT regulations. The Minister of Justice<lb/> initiated a comprehensive programme for the reduction of administrative burdens, which is based<lb/> on the Standard Cost Model, but is completed by the survey of economic costs beyond the<lb/> business sphere (costs for the citizens). The first phase (total mapping of the burdensome<lb/> regulations) was planned for the first half of 2005. As the project budget was reduced to a<lb/> minimum, it is being undertaken with fewer resources over a longer period of time. Results are<lb/> not expected before the middle of 2007.<lb/> In Poland, three pilot projects have already been implemented:<lb/> •<lb/> A study, supported by the Office of the Committee for European Integration, was<lb/> completed in December 2005 on the SCM and the perceptions of administrative costs in<lb/> the road transport sector.<lb/> •<lb/> Another study, supported by the Ministry of Finance, was aimed at measuring the<lb/> administrative costs related to compliance with the information obligations required to be<lb/> met by VAT payers in Poland. This study gave a rather alarming picture of the tax<lb/> sector, since the level of administrative barriers was estimated at approximately 45.7%<lb/> of all tax revenues in 2004.<lb/> •<lb/> A third study was conducted on the initiative of the National Bank of Poland on<lb/> administrative costs relating to the application of banking law.<lb/> A plan for administrative burden reduction was submitted to the Council of Ministers, together<lb/> with the comprehensive Regulatory Reform Programme, for adoption in August 2006.<lb/> The lessons learned during the first benchmark were used to improve the method. In 2005<lb/> Poland and the Netherlands have conducted a benchmark on transport legislation. This was<lb/> done according to the benchmarking method described in the international manual. The results of<lb/> this benchmark are set out in Benchmark Transport EU Legislation Poland – The Netherlands 108 .<lb/> For Poland, the benchmark was part of a more extensive research into their transport<lb/> legislation 109 .<lb/> In the Slovak Republic, a paper 110 prepared on the initiative of the National Agency for<lb/> Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (NADSME), assessed the status and identified<lb/> 108<lb/> See: www.administrative-burdens.com.<lb/> 109<lb/> See: M.

            <figDesc>Hungary, a simplification exercise was undertaken after the fall of communism which<lb/> addressed the form and content of the stock of legislation. It was believed to be essential to<lb/> reduce the number of rules that had no longer any practical utility and several systematic<lb/> deregulation programmes were implemented.<lb/> Further initiatives to deregulate were undertaken, following the same principles and policy. The<lb/> 2004 Programme on Law Simplification contained the task of mapping the changes in<lb/> administrative costs caused by new legislation over a 4-month period. Having received<lb/> responses from the ministries, the coordinating unit of the Ministry of Justice suspended this<lb/> project and, instead, asked ministries for ideas from their own experiences for simplification. The<lb/> proposal for the year 2005 was formulated having regard to these experiences 114 .<lb/> 111<lb/> See Administrative Procedures Act, Section 93 (1): &quot; A regulation is valid until it is repealed by an administrative authority of<lb/> the Supreme Court, or until expiry, or until repeal of the provision delegating authority. &quot;<lb/> 112<lb/> See the 2004 English version of the overview: http://www.oiguskantsler.ee/.files/36.pdf.<lb/> 113</figDesc>

            <figDesc>Two distinct patterns may be seen in the NMS. The first is where the executive branch of<lb/> government dominates the legislature (Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta).
